<p>They introduced themselves as hunter-gatherers. According to them, many citizens had died from the prolonged war between Schupert and the Royal Palace, and those who survived were runaways who formed groups of their own.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak had no clue what they meant, but he had to admit that he was sent to another world.</p>
<p>“Then lead me there.”</p>
<p>Curious, Shin Jonghak visited the hunter-gatherers’ base. Just like their name suggested, they lived day-to-day by looking for food, often starving on days they couldn’t find any.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak offered them food.</p>
<p>However, thugs who smelled the food came to him.</p>
<p>“…Where did you lot get that food?”</p>
<p>Three armored knights appeared from the darkness. The hunter-gatherers trembled in fear.</p>
<p>“Offer it to Count Schupert if you want to keep your life.”</p>
<p>The knights were arrogant and forceful. Shin Jonghak sneered and pierced their hearts with his spear. The three knights were killed in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>When the battle ended, the hunter-gatherers suddenly bowed to Shin Jonghak. Shin Jonghak liked the feeling of being treated like a king.</p>
<p>“P-Please accept us….”</p>
<p>The hunter-gatherers’ chief cried and pleaded. Since Shin Jonghak needed men to look for his comrades, he decided to take in these barbarians.</p>
<p>…Just like that, a month went by.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak found a farmable plot of land and made the hunter-gatherers sow seeds. He picked 30 men and women with talent for martial arts and taught them the way of the spear.</p>
<p>Because the atmosphere had ample mana, they grew quickly.</p>
<p>…Just like that, half a year went by.</p>
<p>They ran out of food. Their small farms weren’t enough to feed 500 mouths. Shin Jonghak had no choice but to form the Vigilante to steal supplies from Schupert’s territory.</p>
<p>…Just like that, a year went by.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak had become the full-fledged leader of the Vigilante. His hair reached his shoulders, and he trimmed his goatee to look cool.</p>
<p>The members of the Vigilante also grew stronger by the day. Hard-working disciples learned many things from their good master, and they became powerful enough to be called ‘knights’.</p>
<p>…Just like that, two years went by.</p>
<p>While protecting the hunter-gatherers from monsters, stealing supplies from Schupert’s territory, and fighting the Count’s knights, Shin Jonghak came to a big realization. His black-flame spear had become capable of scorching the enemy’s magic power as well.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak gave his newly evolved Gift a cool name, ‘Magic Devourer’. But that only increased his desire to go back to Earth, and his hatred for the ones who placed him in this world grew.</p>
<p>…And three years later, in the present.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak finally found the person he’d been looking for.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>He was cornered by Schupert’s knight, Raylen, but Raylen didn’t enter Shin Jonghak’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I waited three years.”</p>
<p>He pointed his spear at Kim Hajin’s back. <em>Kwaaaa…</em> Black flames shot up from his spear intensely.</p>
<p>“What happened and where…”</p>
<p>During the past three years, Shin Jonghak killed thousands of monsters and defeated hundreds of knights. He fought as often as he ate, and survival was the only thing on his mind. In this unknown world, he even had to take care of 500 lives. As even the slightest carelessness could mean death, he had to be on guard at every second.</p>
<p>“What have you been doing for the past three years…”</p>
<p>Under the heavy weight of responsibility and life-or-death situations, Shin Jonghak reached a never-before-seen realm.</p>
<p>“You better explain properly if you don’t want to die.”</p>
<p>As the Spear God who surpassed all limits, Shin Jonghak emitted a boundless magic power and an overwhelming presence.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>“Well damn….”</p>
<p>I became speechless. I was surprised by Shin Jonghak’s sudden growth, but his killing intent was what surprised me more. It seemed like it was stabbing my heart.</p>
<p>“He’s tough to deal with. Retreat.”</p>
<p>Even Raylen, who introduced himself as a Sword Master, put on a troubled face. Then, he retreated as soon as Shin Jonghak made his move. None of his knights uttered a word of complaint.</p>
<p><em>Poke—</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk poked my side.</p>
<p>“Oi, what’s up with him?”</p>
<p>“…Looks like he’s been here for three years.”</p>
<p>“Three years?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it happens occasionally. He’s been trapped in time alone.”</p>
<p>When Raylen and his knights disappeared, Shin Jonghak and the Vigilante members quickly moved. They surrounded us in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak came up to me, glaring at me. He seemed to have aged by at least 6~7 years.</p>
<p>“Explain, Kim Hajin. I might kill you depending on your answer.”</p>
<p>He was genuinely enraged. Because the presence he was giving off was completely different than the old Shin Jonghak I knew, tension enveloped my body.</p>
<p>“…I will. We’ve been looking for you too, kuhum.”</p>
<p>I cleared my throat and pointed at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“First, it’s all because of her.”</p>
<p>…1 hour later.</p>
<p>I finished explaining everything to Shin Jonghak. He became furious when he heard what happened, and he charged at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>To my surprise, they fought on equal footing. In fact, Shin Jonghak overwhelmed her initially. It was yet again a matter of suitability.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s black flames burned up Jin Sahyuk’s magic power, and Jin Sahyuk was put at a disadvantage without her [Magic Weapon Emission].</p>
<p>Watching their fight, goosebumps shot up on my body. I never expected Shin Jonghak to fight evenly with Jin Sahyuk. Since he even pushed close to victory at first, my shock couldn’t be described with words.</p>
<p>Of course, if the fight prolonged, Jin Sahyuk would have won with her cheaty Gift, [Reality Manipulation].</p>
<p>In any case, after a conversation of fists, we returned to Shin Jonghak’s town.</p>
<p>“The crystal you talked about is in the town.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak had a crystal shard inside the town. But I was more surprised with the town than the crystal shard. It had fences, guards, watchtowers, and most things that a town needed.</p>
<p>“…You built all this on your own?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked Shin Jonghak. With their fight, she had acknowledged Shin Jonghak’s strength.</p>
<p>“Everyone helped. Though, of course, I did 70% of the work. 673 people live here now.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak explained proudly. But soon, he looked back at me with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>“But this place is really just a materialized fake world?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak didn’t say much, but he couldn’t hide his bitterness.</p>
<p>“Anyways, take it. You can go back if you have six, right?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak handed the shard over.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Continental Fragment Piece]</p>
<p>—A crystal that maintains the Recorded Past.</p>
<p>—Supplies mana for growth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As expected, each crystal shard had its own function. This was what helped Shin Jonghak grow so quickly.</p>
<p>Now, I had two.</p>
<p>“Bring your townsmen to the capital. It’s a much better place now.”</p>
<p>“…Capital?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak seemed reluctant. It was the same for the Vigilante members standing next to him. They were clearly unhappy with having us here.</p>
<p>“Staying here is dangerous. Monsters will arrive soon.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk tried to persuade Shin Jonghak, but he only scoffed at her, asking how she knew that. Jin Sahyuk scoffed back and explained.</p>
<p>“This is the world I lived in. I know better than anyone else what will happen in the future.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak stared at Jin Sahyuk fixedly, then turned his head towards me.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin, what is this crazy bitch blabbering on about?”</p>
<p>…The second fight between Shin Jonghak and Jin Sahyuk started.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Pandemonium, Chameleon Troupe’s Base]</p>
<p>When news broke that Fenrir was captured, Boss wanted to head out immediately to rescue him. That day, she lost her cool. She couldn’t see what was in front of her and couldn’t hear what anyone said.</p>
<p>However, Spartan was there to stop Boss. Spartan let Boss know that Kim Hajin was safe, and knowing that Kim Hajin and Spartan were connected, Boss had no choice but to believe him.</p>
<p>“…I’ll say it once again, if anything happens to Kim Hajin, you’re dead.”</p>
<p>From that day, Boss always had Spartan by her side. She wanted to know if anything happened to Kim Hajin as soon as possible.</p>
<p>—Pieeek.</p>
<p>Spartan shook his beak sorrowfully.</p>
<p>“…I’m kidding. Well, half-kidding.”</p>
<p>Boss smiled and held Spartan in her arms.</p>
<p>“So, Boss, what are we going to do~? We kidnapped her parents too.” Jain asked. She was staring at Boss from the couch.</p>
<p>Boss replied briefly, “First, let the three of them talk.”</p>
<p>“Un~ Okay, but there’s something else you should know before that~”</p>
<p>Jain’s expression stiffened frighteningly.</p>
<p>“There’s a rumor going around that ‘Bell’ joined the Orden Assassination Team.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Boss’ shoulders froze. Just hearing his name filled her with rage. However, she constantly told herself to cool her head. All for a more thorough revenge.</p>
<p>“Also… about the Kwang-Oh Incident. We found out who was behind it. You’ve heard of Kim Sukho, right? He’s the former president.”</p>
<p>Boss nodded. Kim Sukho, the former president of Korea and the man who seized authority of the Association.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of work to do~”</p>
<p>“You’re right.”</p>
<p>Jain snickered and stretched.</p>
<p>“Mmm~ Oh right, Boss, we decided to include Droon in this mission.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Boss furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a choice, we need his power for this mission. Think of all the powerful people joining the Orden Assassination Mission.”</p>
<p>Jain used Droon’s information network to find out that humans decided to deploy their second team around the time that the Djinns’ team was setting out.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong, Chae Joochul, Yun Seung-Ah, Vast Expanse, Yoo Sihyuk, Temple of Justice, Wicked, Destruction, Evil Society, Satan’s Servants, Pandemonium… Famous Heroes and Djinns from all around, as well as Kim Hajin’s friends Chae Nayun and Rachel, were all participating in this mission.</p>
<p>“Also, that child is probably coming out of the Tower of Wish soon~ As soon as he finds out what happened, he’s going to participate for sure.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho, the man of interest.</p>
<p>This assassination mission would be a ferocious battlefield with all sorts of characters. No one knew for certain what would happen there.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure none of them will stand a chance against Droon~”</p>
<p>Jain smiled as she thought about Droon. He had entered puberty and refused to talk with them recently, but he was showing interest in Yi Yuri who was around his age.</p>
<p>“…But Jain, Droon is too dangerous.”</p>
<p>“No, Boss~ Dangerous versus dangerous, crazy versus crazy. That’s the best~”</p>
<p>Droon. The Gift he possessed rivaled the level of an Authority. The ability to summon and tame ‘aliens’ who wandered in the chaos of the dimensional boundary.</p>
<p>Droon’s rabbit, Mimyo, was immune to Aileen’s Spirit Speech, and was an ultimate weapon that could even devour a devil.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Boss nodded silently. She suddenly recalled a painful memory from the past. The day Kim Hajin was killed by Kurukuru. Thinking about that day made her dizzy.</p>
<p>“Fine.”</p>
<p>As Jain said, it seemed they needed to borrow Droon’s power to combat the Monster King and his servants.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Akatrina Continent.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak and the Vigilante entered the capital. I thought Prihi and her knights would oppose the idea, but to my surprise, they welcomed it. It was because the Vigilante only bothered Schupert over the years.</p>
<p>“Huaaaam….”</p>
<p>In any case, the sun had set, and it was now late into the night. I yawned while laying in my bed.</p>
<p>“Now I just need to collect four more.”</p>
<p>Since I had two on me and knew where one of the others was, I should be able to gather them all in 2~3 months. Even then, only 2~3 weeks should have passed in the real world.</p>
<p>“…I wonder what Boss is doing.”</p>
<p>I suddenly thought about Boss, though I didn’t know why.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, someone knocked on my door.</p>
<p>“Who—”</p>
<p>Before I could ask who it was, the door opened. Jin Sahyuk was standing beyond the door. She approached me in her pajamas.</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>“I can’t sleep so I came to find you.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said something that didn’t quite make sense while staring at me with a serious expression.</p>
<p>“You can’t sleep? What does that have to do with me?”</p>
<p>“…Today, you asked me who I was looking for in this world.”</p>
<p>I nodded. I did ask that earlier in the day.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so what?”</p>
<p>“There’s something I wanted to ask you about that.”</p>
<p>“…At this hour?”</p>
<p>“Kindspring.”</p>
<p>I furrowed my brows. Kind what?</p>
<p>“Kindspring Winter.”</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk’s serious and somewhat sad expression made me serious as well.</p>
<p>“…That’s the name of the person I’m looking for. Have you heard of him before?”</p>
<p>Kindspring Winter.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a name I knew.</p>
<p>A kind spring and winter?</p>
<p>I was about to reply, ‘He’s a kind person,’ when a thought suddenly crossed my mind.</p>
<p>Kindspring Winter.</p>
<p>Spring and Winter.</p>
<p>Spring, Chun.</p>
<p>Winter, Dong.</p>
<p>Chundong.</p>
<p>It was surely only a wordplay, but my thoughts stopped when I realized this possibility. It felt like I was hit in the back of my head with a hammer.</p>
<p>“…Kindspring Winter?”</p>
<p>I swallowed hard and muttered the name again.</p>
<p>Could it be? No, why would Kim Chundong’s name suddenly pop up here?</p>
<p>“Right, that’s who I’m looking for. It’s been a long time, so long that I don’t even remember the face of my servant.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked at me with a bitter face. I slowly got up from the bed. I needed some time to think about this on my own.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who that is….”</p>
<p>“I already found him. The royal library has portraits of every servant.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at my face as though she was trying to find someone else in it.</p>
<p>I remembered what Kim Chundong told me when we met in the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>—We will meet again. But let me ask you for a favor before then…</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s gaze stayed on my face. Soon, she spoke.</p>
<p>“Kindspring… looked just like you.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything. I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>“Oi, Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spoke, just like how she did usually.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have something you want to say? You… son of a bitch.”</p>
<p>At that moment, something popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>It was a ‘remake notice’ created by a change in the story’s setting.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 263. The Omen of Assembly (2)</p>
<p>[Remake notice — Kim Chundong’s diary]</p>
<p>「…The chirping of birds woke me up. Dry grass tickled my back. Leaves were swaying before my eyes. Clearly, I was not in my room.</p>
<p>Questions arose in my mind. Why am I here? Did someone kidnap me?</p>
<p>Whatever the case might be, it didn’t really matter. I wasn’t startled at all. I’d been drowning in indefinite numbness all my life. All these years, I had felt neither happy nor sad. For this reason, I quickly adjusted to this dramatic change without so much as a flinch.</p>
<p>Still, I figured I should at least find out where I was. I slowly got up and began walking through the forest. The more I walked, the stranger I felt. Above my head, two moons shined and countless stars twinkled.</p>
<p>After a while, I could hear people talking. I walked towards the sound. I pursued their voices.</p>
<p>I arrived at a strange village soon after. The villagers were all dressed in archaic fashion, and the buildings looked as if they had been built in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I remained calm. Momentary confusion quickly subsided. The ice attributed magic power in my heart embodied unbreakable coldness.</p>
<p>I asked the villagers where I was. They replied that I was at ‘the outskirts of Plerion, year 533’.</p>
<p>After that, I quickly grasped the situation. This was neither a dream, nor an abduction, nor a game. I had simply fallen into another world.</p>
<p>Who brought me here? How and why did they bring me here?</p>
<p>Such questions were meaningless to me. I lived only because I was born. I was alone from the beginning. So, the question of where I live was trivial to me.</p>
<p>I began my new life in ‘Plerion’.</p>
<p>I began training in order to survive. Fortunately, Plerion was full of magic power. I practiced my sword skills and polished my magic power. After 10 years, I became a member of the Royal Knights.</p>
<p>My initial duty as a knight was to protect the royal concubine, who gave birth to a daughter named ‘Prihi’. But the concubine never had the chance to meet Prihi in person. As the third princess, Prihi grew up in the royal palace, where her mother was prohibited from entering. The concubine was only allowed to watch her daughter from afar.</p>
<p>Three years went by. One day, a child came to visit me. The name of this child was Prihi. She wished to meet her mother. I found her tiny figure and sparkling eyes cute.</p>
<p>I secretly let her in. Prihi returned after 10 minutes of brief conversation with her mother. She gave me a big smile and expressed her gratitude.</p>
<p>The child, who was only three years old at the time, began to visit her mother once every week. Their faces grew brighter day after day.</p>
<p>Another year passed.</p>
<p>Without prior notice, I was transferred to the Royal Central Knights, away from the concubine. I heard that Prihi, who was unaware of my reassignment, had come to visit her mother as usual, only to be captured and punished by her father. Rumor had it that he whipped her until her tears dried up.</p>
<p>From then on, I spent my time away from the princess and the concubine.</p>
<p>As time went by, calamities began to appear across the entire continent. To make matters worse, the King fell ill.</p>
<p>Prihi, now five years old, came to see me. She told me her mother passed away, and that her brothers and sisters had murdered her. Prihi suppressed her tears and asked me for help.</p>
<p>‘…Please become my servant. My mother died, and I am powerless….’</p>
<p>It was then I realized for the first time that <em>I</em> could be someone’s only hope. And I, too, sought hope in her.</p>
<p>Even then, the princess did not know my name. I introduced myself to her as Kim Spring. She asked me if my name was ‘Kindspring’ for clarification. I just nodded.</p>
<p>A lonely life without parents, friends, and love.</p>
<p>‘…I swear by my name to serve Your Highness forever.’</p>
<p>Surely I wouldn’t regret dedicating such a life to someone.」</p>
<p>[Above is Kim Chundong’s setting.]</p>
<p>I chuckled to myself as I read Kim Chundong’s diary. To sum it up, when I replaced Kim Chundong on Earth, the real Kim Chundong was transferred to a different world— to the ‘past’ of a different world.</p>
<p>“What’s so funny?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned. She was completely serious right now. I began to prepare an answer in my head. But what exactly was I supposed to say in this kind of situation?</p>
<p>No matter how long I thought about it, there was no ‘right’ answer.</p>
<p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
<p>I cleared my throat.</p>
<p>With a bitter expression, Jin Sahyuk asked.</p>
<p>“…Do you still hate me?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I stared at Jin Sahyuk silently. Many emotions were flickering in her eyes.</p>
<p>‘Should I just say no? Should I insist that I’m not Kindspring, that we only look alike…?’</p>
<p>But my heart refused to lie. [Synchronization] trembled violently inside me.</p>
<p>“Be with me again.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk continued. It seemed she was confident that I was Kim Chundong.</p>
<p>“We’ll figure everything out once we get back to our homeland. No matter how much time has passed, we have to go back to Plerion. Don’t you know that?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Her remark made me serious too.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s only wish was to return to Akatrina and reconstruct Plerion.</p>
<p>But Akatrina’s Demon Realm Transformation had long been completed. Even if she could go back in time, doing so would simply be an act of suicide.</p>
<p>“…The continent is already under the control of the devil. Reconstruction is impossible.”</p>
<p>I flatly opposed, but Jin Sahyuk was adamant.</p>
<p>“If that’s actually the case, then I might as well be dead. I am the King of Plerion. Life outside Plerion is meaningless to me. If I’m going to die either way, I’d rather die in my country.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was determined.</p>
<p>To her, compromising was not an option. Her wish constituted the fundamental reason for her existence. But my answer was already set in stone.</p>
<p>“I decline.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s shoulders trembled. She didn’t do a very good job at hiding her anger, but her anger was directed towards herself, not me.</p>
<p>“It’s late. Go to sleep.”</p>
<p>I pointed at the door. Still, Jin Sahyuk looked at me without moving a muscle. Her lips trembled slightly as if she had something to say, but no words came out of her mouth.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>Eventually I turned the light off and crawled into my bed. About half an hour passed before Jin Sahyuk’s presence finally disappeared.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Buried under a blanket, I thought of Kim Chundong.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t come up with definitive answers to the questions in my head. The more I thought, the more lost I felt.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…A new day dawned. Jin Sahyuk couldn’t get a wink of sleep. Thoughts, anguish, and misery haunted her. She was wide awake for most of the night, absorbed in thought.</p>
<p>She reached one conclusion.</p>
<p>‘Of course he’s not going to forgive me. After all, I still don’t know how to say I’m sorry….’</p>
<p>But there was one thing she couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>‘Why is Kim Hajin so fond of my past self, ‘Prihi’? She betrayed Kindspring.’</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Jin Sahyuk turned her gaze to the sun outside her window. The sun rose gracefully and shone down on the mountains and the streams below. The view of her hometown bathed in blue light was as beautiful as ever.</p>
<p>“What if….”</p>
<p>This was all too happy and too cozy to be an illusion. Couldn’t she stay here forever? If she could somehow hinder others from collecting the crystal shards, she could stay here, in her kingdom, forever. Maybe that wasn’t such a bad idea.</p>
<p>…But she knew she shouldn’t.</p>
<p>This was not the real Akatrina. And it would be wrong for her as a king to settle for the fake over the real.</p>
<p>A king should not be complacent.</p>
<p>A king should protect her people and her land.</p>
<p>A king should not abandon her country.</p>
<p>A king should….</p>
<p>—No, that’s not how you do it!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cranky voice interrupted her train of thought. She got up slowly and looked outside her window, only to discover that dwarf called Alien or whatever repairing the castle wall.</p>
<p>—Here, watch this. This magic power will repair the wall-!</p>
<p>As soon as she shouted, cement began to cling and align itself perfectly to the wall. That Gift was clearly wasted on that dwarf.</p>
<p>—Hm? Miss Aileen, you’re up early.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon approached the dwarf. With a bright smile, she patted Aileen’s head.</p>
<p>—Yup. Kim Hajin said he’s gonna give me chocolates.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>His name alone was enough to ruin Jin Sahyuk’s mood.</p>
<p>“That dwarf….”</p>
<p>‘You can’t address him so casually. He’s not the kind of person you can get friendly with. He was my servant first. He only lived for me and not you….’</p>
<p>But again, she was the one who abandoned her faithful servant.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk clenched her teeth and shut the window. She drew the curtain and lay back on the bed in the darkened room.</p>
<p>Right now, she needed more time to contemplate and to make decisions.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[30F, Demon King’s Castle]</p>
<p>Sparks of gold and black collided with each other and flew in every direction. Magic power and demonic energy swirled with each other, creating whirlpools. The whirlpools turned into a giant typhoon that violently tore apart the heaven and the earth. Sparks exploded, charring the soil.</p>
<p>And the result of the challenge lay at the eye of the storm.</p>
<p>Two men stood at the center of the storm, where the relentless clashes of magic power and demonic energy had subsided. Kim Suho’s entire body was shining brightly. And his sword was lodged in the Demon King’s chest. This was a fatal blow. It was now clear who the winner was.</p>
<p>Heavy silence filled the Demon King’s castle.</p>
<p>Kim Suho froze, with his sword stuck in the Demon King’s body. The Demon King did not move. He only looked down at Kim Suho. From afar, it seemed as if the two were hugging each other. A strange tinge of happiness flickered in the Demon King’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Has it been… almost half a year?”</p>
<p>The King’s voice reverberated, reeling.</p>
<p>“I had a… great time…. It was a lot of fun… watching you grow….”</p>
<p>The Demon King smiled happily. He reached out and touched Kim Suho’s hair. The brown hair, which was now pretty long, swayed softly at his touch.</p>
<p>“I… will not… forget you… for you granted me death….”</p>
<p>The King’s body started to turn into dust. From head to toe, his body slowly began to fade away. Kim Suho looked straight at the King with his unwavering eyes.</p>
<p>The King’s last words were short.</p>
<p>“Thank you…. I’ll gladly… accept this death….”</p>
<p>He said in one breath.</p>
<p>The King disappeared completely, and Kim Suho, now alone, looked at the empty throne across the room. Up until this point, the throne had always been occupied by the Demon King. Kim Suho was not used to the vacancy.</p>
<p>“…The final floor still remains.”</p>
<p>The witch approached him. She stood behind Kim Suho and continued calmly.</p>
<p>“It is called the [Floor of Decision].”</p>
<p>A golden staircase ascended above the throne. The final path shined brightly. Kim Suho nodded at the sight of it.</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“And, this.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the witch handed him a slip of paper. Though he grabbed it instinctively, Kim Suho soon frowned in confusion.</p>
<p>“This is…?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been given the right to take one of the Tower’s residents outside as your supporter.”</p>
<p>[Summon Coupon]</p>
<p>“And just for your information, my level is 40.”</p>
<p>The witch coyly appealed to him. Kim Suho gave a small smile and stood in front of the staircase leading to the 31st floor.</p>
<p>Different phrases were engraved on the faces of the golden steps.</p>
<p>[Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.]</p>
<p>Kim Suho climbed the stairs, reading each phrase one by one.</p>
<p>[A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.]</p>
<p>After reading that phrase, Kim Suho pretty much figured out who the last administrator was.</p>
<p>[Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.]</p>
<p>A saint born of a virgin and the central figure of the world’s largest religion, whose birth itself marked the start of a new calendar (Before Christ).</p>
<p>Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>At the end of the stairs the Saint was smiling brightly.</p>
<p>Kim Suho diligently climbed up the stairs towards him.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[The Akatrina Continent]</p>
<p>Two months went by in Akatrina, during which we finished the construction of the castle wall and the communal shelter. The issue of food scarcity was also mostly taken care of.</p>
<p>“…So, you don’t like studying?”</p>
<p>Currently, I was taking a walk in the garden with the young Jin Sahyuk. Flowers were beginning to bloom in the royal garden which was originally barren.</p>
<p>“That is not the case… my teacher is simply too tyrannical, even though I am the king.”</p>
<p>Prihi grumbled sternly.</p>
<p>Of course, Jin Sahyuk was her teacher.</p>
<p>“But you have to study hard to become stronger.”</p>
<p>The Prihi next to me was nothing but a projection of the materialized past. Therefore, this conversation was meaningless. But I still urged her.</p>
<p>“As you already know, we won’t be staying here for long.”</p>
<p>We already had three crystals in our possession. It wouldn’t take us long to obtain the remaining two shards, since we had already figured out that they were in Schupert’s territory.</p>
<p>“…Right. You cannot stay here.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Prihi stopped. She looked up at me with forlorn eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s just that… you remind me of my old servant.”</p>
<p>“…Servant?”</p>
<p>My conscience pricked me. She was clearly talking about Kim Chundong.</p>
<p>“Yes, but he’s a lot older than you. I sent him to prison a while ago, so I don’t even know if he’s still alive or dead, but… he was my most valued servant.”</p>
<p>Prihi continued solemnly. But I couldn’t help but think that she looked cute even in a glum expression. I wanted to pinch her chubby cheeks badly.</p>
<p>“Although sending him away was my fault, I…?”</p>
<p>But I couldn't.</p>
<p>Because someone suddenly blocked our way.</p>
<p>“…What is it, Jin Sahyuk?”</p>
<p>The King flinched at my words. She opened her eyes wide and backed away.</p>
<p>“W-Why are you here again? We already f-finished today’s class.”</p>
<p>Prihi was clearly afraid of Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk, however, approached Prihi without hesitation.</p>
<p>“L-Look at this. I, I know how to condense magic power now. Isn’t this good enough…?”</p>
<p>The King, with a frightened expression, began to recite everything she learned earlier that day. Nevertheless, Jin Sahyuk approached the King and grabbed her wrist. Prihi trembled slightly and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“If you have time for a chitchat, you should practice more.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glared at me as she pulled Prihi towards herself.</p>
<p>“Wait, wait… I haven’t eaten yet….”</p>
<p>Prihi pleaded, but Jin Sahyuk was adamant. She dragged the small king away by force.</p>
<p>“…Geez.”</p>
<p>I watched them leave as I took out the [Mysterious Magnifying Glass]. It was to find out what kind of emotion Jin Sahyuk was feeling at the moment….</p>
<p>[Jealousy]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was feeling jealous of her past self, and I, who she believed was her old servant Kindspring, was the reason for that.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>I let out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>“Priest Kim! Schupert is here! He has the castle surrounded!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a knight came running and shouted.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 264. The Omen of Assembly (3)</p>
<p>Schupert came fully prepared for battle. His army numbered at least a 5000 even at a glance.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Prihi looked down at Count Schupert and Raylen, the two traitors, from above the castle walls. Schupert glared back at his former king with a cold gaze.</p>
<p>“King, I heard that you accepted the Vigilante into your ranks.”</p>
<p>He brought up Shin Jonghak. Aileen and Jin Sahyuk, who were standing next to me, both frowned.</p>
<p>“You seem to have gotten some resources from the Vigilante group….”</p>
<p>Count Schupert looked displeased. He could tell that Plerion’s dilapidated castle walls were reinforced with a powerful, tough material.</p>
<p>“If you don’t hand over the man behind this, a declaration of war will be unavoidable.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Prihi didn’t answer. Declaration of war. Those three words fell heavily on the young king’s shoulders. Schupert also noticed her fear, as he sneered.</p>
<p>“Hand him over now. Nothing bad will happen to Plerion if you do. I will guarantee what little authority you have left.”</p>
<p>He was full of arrogance. Prihi clenched her fists at the count’s attitude.</p>
<p>“Fuck off, you piece of shit—!”</p>
<p>At that moment, someone cursed out loud. The improper language reverberated through the entire castle. Everyone stared at the person who cursed in a daze.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>She was glaring at the count with a look of fury. The count stared at Jin Sahyuk, wondering if he heard right. As soon as his eyes met Jin Sahyuk’s, Jin Sahyuk gave a twisted smile.</p>
<p>“I’ve been wanting to say that to you for so long.”</p>
<p>“…Your servant lacks decorum. Or perhaps I should say she takes after—”</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>Before Schupert could finish his sentence, Jin Sahyuk’s spear struck the ground next to him. <em>Pzzzt…</em> The ground cracked and pieces of dirt and stone shot up into the air. The crackling magic power carried astounding destructive power that made Schupert swallow his saliva.</p>
<p>“It won’t miss next time. Fuck off if you don’t want to die.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had shown more patience just now than ever before.</p>
<p>Schupert looked at her with eyes full of anger.</p>
<p>“…Two months later, we will come to claim your heads.”</p>
<p>“Screw off. We were going to attack you first anyway, dirty traitors.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Schupert didn’t say anything in response. He shook his head as though he would be wasting his time by talking to her.</p>
<p>“You heard what he said, right? That he’s declaring war.”</p>
<p>Seeing Schupert’s army retreat, Jin Sahyuk spoke.</p>
<p>“We’re entering hell-training starting from today. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a knight or an ordinary soldier. If you don’t show up, I will—”</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>A snort interrupted Jin Sahyuk. Jin Sahyuk’s eyes shot open as she turned around. There, Shin Jonghak was standing arrogantly with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Mind your own business.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s face stiffened. Sparks flew between their eyes… The surrounding knights and soldiers stealthily backed away, while Aileen ordered with Spirit Speech.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to fight, do it down there. Don’t damage the walls.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak obediently went down the castle walls. As soon as they reached the ground, they began a fierce fight.</p>
<p><em>Kwang— Koong—!</em></p>
<p>Magic power exploded and flames erupted. The fight was just as heated as their personalities.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Tower of Wish, Final Floor – Constellation of Decision]</p>
<p>Kim Suho followed the saint to the 31st floor, an empty space surrounded by glass panes in all directions. Sceneries of the Tower of Wish were being shown on the glass panes.</p>
<p>“I’m glad that you’re the one who arrived here.”</p>
<p>The saint spoke. Kim Suho stood still and stared at the glass panes. 2nd floor, 3rd floor, 8th floor, 16th floor, 21st floor… He could see many Players and residents of the Tower.</p>
<p>“This is what you have achieved.”</p>
<p>The saint said with a smile. However, his voice had split into multiple voices. Feeling strange, Kim Suho turned around.</p>
<p>There, he saw many existences in the form of spirits. They were all exalted beings at the forefront of human religion: Buddha, Muhammad, etc.</p>
<p>“…Then can I know now?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked them what he wanted to know.</p>
<p>“Why I was reborn in this world.”</p>
<p>It was foolish to ask the reason for one's existence. The saint smiled gently and shook his head.</p>
<p>“You will realize your value and fate in the near future… Rather than that, I want to ask, how do you view this Tower?”</p>
<p>Hearing this question, Kim Suho looked back at the window panes. He saw Prestige, Crevon, the Demon Realm and the demons who were crying at the news of their lord’s death.</p>
<p>“You have to make a decision.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked back at the saint.</p>
<p>“…A decision, you say?”</p>
<p>The saint nodded.</p>
<p>“Whether to maintain this world or destroy it.”</p>
<p>Tower of Wish. It was called as such because it was said to contain the wishes of all of humanity.</p>
<p>Many residents lived here, and many from Earth became Players to challenge and change themselves in this place. Players carried hope, greed, and expectation. Residents welcomed them while being jealous of their freedom.</p>
<p>However, neither of them resented their birth. Residents of the Tower found happiness in their own way. Some smiled while watching their children grow up and some found new love with the Players from Earth.</p>
<p>“I….”</p>
<p>The Tower of Wish had become a world of its own, just like Akatrina and Earth, the blue planet inhabited by humanity.</p>
<p>So… no one had the authority to destroy it.</p>
<p>“I wish to maintain this world.”</p>
<p>The saint smiled at Kim Suho’s words.</p>
<p>“I see. But for that to happen, you have to destroy the Tower with your own hands.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Seeing Kim Suho’s bewilderment, the saint pointed at the holy sword Misteltein.</p>
<p>“Cut the ‘shell’ that limits this place as a ‘Tower’ rather than a ‘world’. Only then will this place remain as a proper world.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“…The Tower of Wish will become one with Earth?”</p>
<p>He asked with genuine curiosity. The saint shook his head and continued his explanation.</p>
<p>“No, they will remain separate. Residents of the Tower still won’t be able to leave, while Players will be free to enter and leave as they please. The only difference will be that the boundary between this world and the Phenomenon Realm will become thinner and that this world will become everlasting.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho also knew of the words ‘Phenomenon Realm’. It was what some of the administrators were obsessed with.</p>
<p>“But this might cause the most heinous villain or the bravest hero in history to reappear.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded. He didn’t need to think much about his decision. He had already made his decision when the saint first told him about it.</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>The decision Kim Suho made wasn’t for the happiness of the Tower’s residents or the Players of Earth. There was no philosophical ideology nor emotional intent behind it either.</p>
<p>“I still wish to maintain this world.”</p>
<p>It was because this was the right decision.</p>
<p>Because Kim Suho was convinced that it was ‘right’.</p>
<p>“…Then cut the ‘Tower’ from this place.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho raised his sword. Magic power blazed up around him as he activated his ultimate skill. A brilliant golden light shot out, and Misteltein’s blade shone beautifully.</p>
<p>Kim Suho swung down his holy sword to cut the ‘shell’ that restricted this world to a Tower.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>The holy sword descended as it dug into the origin of the Tower.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Pandemonium, Chameleon Troupe’s Base]</p>
<p>“…Is it okay then?”</p>
<p>On the 6th basement floor of the Chameleon Troupe’s base, Cheok Jungyeong scratched his neck awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Yes, it seems you overworked your body a bit while using this Energy Blast skill. You shouldn’t be too willy nilly with it.”</p>
<p>Yi Yuri smacked Cheok Jungyeong’s shoulder. Thanks to her, Cheok Jungyeong had discovered an internal injury that he didn’t even know about.</p>
<p>“Th, tha, thank… kuhum, rest well.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong got up without being able to express his gratitude. As he was about to leave, Yi Yuri’s mother grabbed him.</p>
<p>“Wait… um… when can we go back home?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong stopped and turned around. His intimidating face made Yi Yuri’s parents flinch.</p>
<p>“I told you, you can’t go back.”</p>
<p>“B-But…”</p>
<p>“If you do, you won’t be able to see your daughter ever again. She won’t be able to see you either. You have to stay here for at least 5 years. It’s not that bad since you’ll all be together, right?”</p>
<p>With great power came great side-effects. Because of this, Yi Yuri had to receive thorough systematic training for 5 years. Before she could properly utilize her ‘Authority’, her body had to become capable of handling it.</p>
<p>“B-But we can’t. We have work to do and—“</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong threw them a gold bar. Thinking that perhaps one wasn’t enough, he rummaged through his pocket and threw them a few more, totaling 10kg which was worth about 500 million won.</p>
<p>“We’ll give you as much money as you need. We have a blood diamond for training too. We’ll let you go on walks after a little while, so what’s the problem?”</p>
<p>Yi Yuri’s parents were more concerned about being trapped underground for five years, but Cheok Jungyeong failed to see this.</p>
<p>“Plus, leaving this place is too dangerous. Don’t you understand? We’ll give you more money than you can ever imagine if you just stay here for 5 years? That’s not too much to ask, is it?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>‘We can’t get through to him at all.’ Yi Yuri’s parents sighed inwardly and nodded.</p>
<p>Yi Yuri consoled her parents. In truth, it was the same for her whether she was trapped here or in the Tower of Heroes. The only difference was that she had a boy her age here named Droon.</p>
<p>Yi Yuri blushed faintly as she thought about him. It was then.</p>
<p><em>Woooong….</em></p>
<p>A small earthquake rippled. Cheok Jungyeong sensed that it wasn’t natural and quickly ran out. He only needed three seconds to get to Boss’ office on the 3rd underground floor.</p>
<p>“Boss—! Did you feel that just now?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong called Boss as soon as he arrived. Then, he tilted his head. He even doubted his eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>Boss was wearing a bear head of some sort.</p>
<p>“Mm, you’re here, Gyeong.”</p>
<p>“…Boss, what’s that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this? I got an Effective Good Selector that only worked on items Lv.4 and under, so I brought this one.”</p>
<p>It was the first gift she had received from Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Boss played with the bear’s cheeks with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>“This thing surprisingly has a high magic affinity. I want to get it enchanted.”</p>
<p>“Uh… right, anyway, did you feel that earthquake?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that?”</p>
<p>Boss leisurely looked outside the window. Golden light was flickering in the sky.</p>
<p>“It looks like the Tower of Wish is ending.”</p>
<p>“The Tower of Wish is… ending?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Kim Suho must have done it.”</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa….</em> At that moment, a brilliant golden light spread out across the entire sky. The wave of light signaling the end of the Tower was seen by all of humanity.</p>
<p>[Player MasterHolySword has conquered the Tower of Wish]</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Akatrina]</p>
<p>Prihi prepared for war against Schupert. She had many soldiers at her disposal. After hearing that Plerion had been restored and that the Vigilante had joined her, 4000 people decided to come to the capital from all over Akatrina. Now, the population of Plerion reached 13000.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk, who was appointed as Commander, selected the 3000 most talented individuals to form her army.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was more than enough food to go around. The three crystal shards they collected provided ample livestock, and their fertile farmland could be harvested once every 2~3 weeks.</p>
<p>Plerion’s northeast mines went back into operation; the King gathered miners with food as wages, and 100 or so volunteered for the position. Aileen was the one who became their supervisor. Her Spirit Speech greatly improved their efficiency.</p>
<p>Once ores were mined, smithies went back into operation. Yi Yonghwa used his hellfire to melt the ores, and I utilized Young Dwarf’s Dexterity to craft armor and weapons.</p>
<p>[Young Dwarf’s Dexterity improves to grade-3!]</p>
<p>After about of month of making 20 armors and swords per day, Young Dwarf’s Dexterity finally rose to grade-3.</p>
<p>“…The capital changed a lot thanks to you all.”</p>
<p>Currently, we were in the King’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Prihi smiled happily as she laid in her bed.</p>
<p>“We still have several obstacles to pave through.”</p>
<p>“Haha, what do I have to fear? Reconstruction of Plerion is only a matter of time now.”</p>
<p>“…You should sleep. It is late.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>However, Prihi refused to go to sleep. She seemed to be hoping for something.</p>
<p>I grinned and took out a book I brought. It was Romeo and Juliet, which I copied down by accessing my laptop through my eyes.</p>
<p>Prihi’s eyes sparkled.</p>
<p>“Do you want to read before going to bed again?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes. What genre is it this time?”</p>
<p>Prihi quickly took the book.</p>
<p>“It’s a romance story. A tragedy, to be exact.”</p>
<p>“A tragedy….”</p>
<p>Prihi already put on a sad expression as she opened the book. I let her be and slowly exited the room.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>I sighed and walked down the stairs.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I thought of the crystal shards.</p>
<p>I already had three in my possession and knew where two of the others were. One was carried by Count Schupert while the other was carried by his knight, Raylen.</p>
<p>As for the sixth crystal shard… I didn’t need to look for it.</p>
<p>It was hidden deep inside Prihi’s bedroom.</p>
<p>She must have hidden it to prevent us from going back.</p>
<p>“What are you sighing for?”</p>
<p>While I was walking down the stairs, Jin Sahyuk’s sharp voice rang out.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She was standing on the other side of the staircase. Judging by her slightly charred hair, she must have fought with Shin Jonghak not too long ago.</p>
<p>She spoke, “You don’t want to go back either?”</p>
<p>I shook my head and retorted, “Of course not. What about you? Don’t you want to stay here forever?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Puharen isn’t in this world.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho wasn’t in the materialized past. Puharen who became a devil and destroyed the kingdom wasn’t here for the same reason. This world should continue on for a long time.</p>
<p>But to my surprise, Jin Sahyuk refused strongly.</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in the fake.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“But you seem to be.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The reason I was staying close to Prihi was to receive the ‘rewards’ the co-author planned for me. But Jin Sahyuk, who didn’t know this, sent me a sharp look.</p>
<p>“The Prihi you’re talking to is fake.”</p>
<p>“…I know that.’</p>
<p>“Do you?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was serious. She had been too forward recently. Should I tell her that I’m not Kim Chundong?</p>
<p>Well, even if wanted to….</p>
<p>[Synchronization – 8%]</p>
<p>The synchronization rate was too high. 8% meant that at least my foot was Kim Chundong’s. It was probably for the best to just maintain silence while talking to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Go to sleep.”</p>
<p>I walked past Jin Sahyuk who was blocking the way. As I got farther and farther away, Jin Sahyuk’s voice rang out.</p>
<p>“…Your King isn’t her but me.”</p>
<p>I ignored her and continued walking.</p>
<p>“I’m the real one!”</p>
<p>‘Can she shut her mouth for one second?’ Just as I was thinking that she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin—! It’s me—!”</p>
<p>She was filming a drama by herself. I didn’t say a single word and went back downstairs to the 1st floor. But Aileen and Seo Youngji were in the first-floor reception room.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Did they overhear our conversation?</p>
<p>I was thinking about how to find out when their hands trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“L-Lady Aileen, how have things been recently?”</p>
<p>“M-Me? W-Well, it’s been fun. I’m eating chocolates. Nom, nom.”</p>
<p>Awkward didn’t even begin to describe the current situation.</p>
<p>There was no way they didn’t hear us… I let out a sigh.</p>
<p>At that moment, an even louder scream than Jin Sahyuk’s rang out through the royal palace’s crystal ball.</p>
<p>—It’s an emergency! Schupert’s army is making a move!</p>
<p>Everyone in the reception room jumped in surprise. They were making a move already?</p>
<p>We quickly ran to the castle walls.</p>
<p>Many soldiers and knights were already waiting on standby.</p>
<p>“Priest Kim!”</p>
<p>A knight called me. I jumped up and landed on top of the castle wall.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Look over there.”</p>
<p>The knight pointed at the horizon. I could certainly see something moving en masse. I opened my eyes widely and stared at it closely.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…The heck?”</p>
<p>“Can you see them?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but they are….”</p>
<p>The ones running here weren’t enemies.</p>
<p>They were citizens.</p>
<p>Refugees, to be exact.</p>
<p>—Aiya.</p>
<p>—Mommy, I left my toy behind….</p>
<p>—Haaargh, I can’t walk anymore.</p>
<p>I focused Stigma’s magic power on my eyes. My vision stretched out past the marching refugees, mountains, and rivers until it reached Schupert’s castle.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>A giant existence about 5 meters in size covered in a mist of demonic energy was destroying everything in sight.</p>
<p>The moment I saw it, a new alert popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>[Third Goal – Stop the devil or escape from the Recorded Past.]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s step-brother, Puharen, who would later become a devil, was actually materialized in this world.</p>
<p>“Well, shit….”</p>
<p>Schupert was just suppressing it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 265. Assembly (1)</p>
<p>Although Prihi’s step-brother, Puharen, was the youngest member of the royal family, because he was the Queen’s only son, Puharen was named the Crown Prince of Plerion. But he was meek and feeble in nature, and he wasn’t interested in the throne. He was far too young to be a king anyway.</p>
<p>And so, after the death of the former king, Prihi imprisoned Puharen with the help of her brothers and sisters, who secretly hoped to become the king in place of Puharen.</p>
<p>Whether it was a coincidence or the result of a scheme remains a mystery. But after that day, Prihi’s brothers and sisters began to die one after the other under mysterious circumstances. The third and the fourth heirs got caught up in fatal accidents, and the second heir died from food poisoning, leaving Prihi behind to become the only person in line for the throne.</p>
<p>“Devil?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk approached me, disturbing my train of thought.</p>
<p>I nodded and answered, “Puharen is right over there.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s expression immediately froze. She turned to face me in utter astonishment.</p>
<p>“Pu, what, Puharen?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“But you said he wasn’t here!”</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought at the time.”</p>
<p>“What the….”</p>
<p>Stunned, Jin Sahyuk looked at the other side of the wall. Refugees were approaching the castle as Puharen’s fog, which was made out of demonic energy, spread evenly across the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>“…Fuck.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered. To her, Puharen was virtually the symbol of fear.</p>
<p>Her response was reasonable, considering Puharen’s devil, ‘Morax’, was even stronger than Plucas.</p>
<p>“What happened?!”</p>
<p>Prihi came soon. She briskly climbed up the castle wall and looked down below. The continuous procession of refugees was now stretched out across the horizon.</p>
<p>“Refugees.” A knight spoke.</p>
<p>I stood still and looked down at the refugees.</p>
<p>There were at least 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Prihi frowned.</p>
<p>“…Refugees?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It appears there has been some kind of disturbance in Schupert’s territory. They’re trying to take shelter here….”</p>
<p>Prihi stayed silent.</p>
<p>For a while she only watched them as they marched closer to the gate of the royal palace.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please give us your order.”</p>
<p>After a long wait, a knight finally hastened her.</p>
<p>Prihi studied the faces of the refugees.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk and I looked at Prihi.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Prihi pondered in silence. She wasn’t sure if Plerion could afford such a sharp increase in its population. Although crops were being grown in the city, if the population doubled, there would most definitely be a shortage of food.</p>
<p>Also, she was facing a moral dilemma. Those refugees were citizens of Schupert. In other words, they were traitors who betrayed the King by choosing to serve Schupert.</p>
<p>“…Those people are traitors who joined hands with Schupert.”</p>
<p>Prihi finally opened her mouth.</p>
<p>Everyone gloomily braced themselves for what she was about to say.</p>
<p>“However,”</p>
<p>Prihi continued.</p>
<p>She clenched her fists. Her small hands embraced sturdy determination.</p>
<p>“…People strive to survive.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk watched Prihi speak in a daze.</p>
<p>I hoped that Jin Sahyuk would learn a thing or two from Prihi, who was completely different from her current self.</p>
<p>“Therefore, I am also at fault for their betrayals.”</p>
<p>The refugees finally arrived at the castle. They were begging us to open the gate.</p>
<p>Prihi looked down at them and announced, “Open… the gate.”</p>
<p>“The King has commanded us to open the gate—!”</p>
<p>The knights roared in unison.</p>
<p>“Open the gate! Open the gate!” With loud cries, the gate slowly opened. The refugees rushed inside the castle with cheers and joy. At the same time, the remaining knights jumped off the walls to protect the refugees.</p>
<p>“This barrier will protect them.”</p>
<p>Aileen also activated her Spirit Speech.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo—</em> A magic power barrier instantly stretched out and covered the entire sky. This giant barrier would protect the procession of the refugees. The size of the barrier was simply overwhelming, as expected of the ‘living dwarf’… I mean, ‘dragon’.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa….</em></p>
<p>Hundreds of arrows blasted past the barrier. They were Jin Seyeon’s magic arrows. Each of the arrows was precisely aimed at monsters that were trying to terrorize the refugees.</p>
<p>Numerous knights, Shin Jonghak, Yi Yongha, and Seo Youngji all stepped forward to help protect the refugees.</p>
<p>“…Why aren’t you doing anything?”</p>
<p>I nudged Jin Sahyuk who was standing still, her gaze still stuck on Prihi.</p>
<p>She flinched and turned to me.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“I’ve said this before but…” Jin Sahyuk said, with her fists clenched, “…I’m the real one. Don’t you forget that. I’m the only real one.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk jumped off the rampart to the battlefield below.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea, Tower of Heroes]</p>
<p>After Kim Suho cleared the Tower of Wish, the outer shell of the Tower crumbled to nothing. At first, people assumed that the Tower had been destroyed. Panic swept across the globe and the price of stocks plummeted. But it was soon announced that the Tower was intact and that it had changed only slightly. People could still enter the Tower, and Players inside the Tower could carry on with their adventures.</p>
<p>“…When is he coming out? It’s taking him really long.”</p>
<p>In a cafe on the 3rd floor of the [Tower of Heroes], Chae Nayun asked.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha answered her question.</p>
<p>“The Association probably has a lot to ask him. Mainly about the reward he received by clearing the Tower. And they’re also probably curious if he would kindly share the reward with them, and if he doesn’t, he’ll have to pay an unbelievable amount in taxes for it….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s meeting with the executives of the Association was ongoing for three straight hours now. Those who came to celebrate his success were all waiting for him to return.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>This was the reason Yoo Yeonha wasn’t fond of the Association. Whose stupid idea was it to hold a meeting with someone who just came back from the Tower without even giving him a second to rest? She clicked her tongue in discontent.</p>
<p>“I’m so fed up with these Association guys.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun muttered a similar response.</p>
<p>“Oh, is that you, Nayun and Yeonha?”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>At the sudden resonance of a soft yet familiar voice, both turned their heads.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah, the leader of ‘Creator’s Sacred Grace’, was there.</p>
<p>“Oh wow, it’s been a while, Unnie.”</p>
<p>“…Hello.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was clearly happy to see her, but Yoo Yeonha struggled to hide her discomfort.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see both of you~”</p>
<p>With a smile, Yun Seung-Ah sat at their table.</p>
<p>“I see you put your hair up, Nayun. It’s cute.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was wearing her hair in a ponytail. She brushed her hair with her hands, happy but also mildly embarrassed by Yun Seung-Ah’s compliment.</p>
<p>“Haha…. It’s just, long hair gets in my way a lot, so I decided to tie it up. I’m gonna cut it short soon, though.”</p>
<p>“But you shouldn’t. It’s really pretty right now.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah patted Chae Nayun on the head and turned her gaze to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Mm, and, Yeonha-ssi?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha felt uncomfortable around Yun Seung-Ah, and Yun Seung-Ah probably felt the same, too. It was all because of the relationship between ‘Creator’s Sacred Grace’ and ‘Essence of the Strait’. Although Essence of the Strait was the current number one guild and virtually invincible, the two guilds had been extremely competitive with each other from the start.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah attacked first.</p>
<p>“I was almost beginning to feel sorry for you, but I’m glad that everything worked out in the end. I heard Essence of the Strait invested a lot of money in the Tower of Wish…. Good thing it didn’t collapse.”</p>
<p>She was pointing out the fact that, despite the astronomical amount of money Essence of the Strait had invested in the Tower, Creator’s Sacred Grace ended up winning the race.</p>
<p>“…Right. It seems that people can still enter the Tower freely, as long as they have an entrance ticket. Nothing seems to have changed inside, so it’s really not a big deal. Rather, I believe the Tower itself is a new possibility for an even bigger market.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha answered plaintively, with her soppy eyes on Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>“But it’s such a shame that even though Suho won, most of the profitable enterprises inside the Tower are managed by other guilds. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Pity and sympathy were Yoo Yeonha’s weapons.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah’s eyebrow twitched slightly.</p>
<p>“…Ah~ Please, don’t be. After all, we have the clear reward in our possession, though I’m not sure what it is just yet.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? But I thought the reward belonged to Suho.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha feigned a sympathetic smile. Yun Seung-Ah found her rival’s tone of voice extremely irritable, and the veins near her temple began to protrude.</p>
<p>“…Kim Suho <em>is</em> Creator’s Sacred Grace. He’ll be promoted to Vice Leader soon~”</p>
<p>“Really? I heard that the salary for Creator’s Sacred Grace’s Vice Leader is basically the same as that of other guilds’ Team Leader….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was trying to money shame Yun Seung-Ah, who immediately countered, “Isn’t that still better than having a mere Chief Officer manage everything in the guild?”</p>
<p>“…Hahaha~”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>And all the while, the two were smiling at each other. The blades lurking in their smiles were sharp, and Chae Nayun chose to stay out of this conversation entirely.</p>
<p>“Lately a lot of people have been talking about how you’re the hidden leader-”</p>
<p>“Oh, right!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha interrupted Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>She grinned and clapped her hands.</p>
<p>“I heard it was your birthday a while ago. Congratulations. How old are you now? 32? 33?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>That was fatal.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah couldn’t say anything. Her expression froze. She wanted to point out that this question was completely unfair, but she couldn’t, because doing so would only unveil her insecurity about age.</p>
<p>Instead, she smiled leisurely.</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t have to congratulate me. After all, you’ll be my age sooner or later, too~”</p>
<p>“Even then I’ll be a lot younger than you~”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah felt as if she had been punched by Yoo Yeonha’s words. It was a fatal blow to her chin. Tears sprang up in her eyes. She had wasted away all those years in devotion to her guild. She used to be young, too….</p>
<p>“Damn it. Why are you even here?”</p>
<p>Finally Yun Seung-Ah decided to put away all the pretense.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha answered with a victorious smile.</p>
<p>“I’m here to congratulate Suho. Also, he asked me about Orden.”</p>
<p>“…As I thought. Seriously, he’s too diligent.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah sighed.</p>
<p>It seemed he was planning on dealing with Orden immediately after the Tower of Wish, even though she had urged him to take a rest.</p>
<p>“Then… Nayun, are you also here for Orden?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yeah.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun gave a bitter smile. She wasn’t exactly stable right now. A lot of things were still lingering in her head, including the Kwang-Oh Incident, her father, her grandfather, Kim Hajin, and Chae Jinyoon….</p>
<p>It was time to clarify her doubts.</p>
<p>“Because Kim Hajin is there.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Pandemonium, Dark basement underneath the plaza]</p>
<p>Boss finished getting ready for the [Orden Assassination Team]. Tomorrow, the Djinns would arrive, and they were scheduled to commence the mission the following day.</p>
<p>“…Wicked?”</p>
<p>Boss tipped her head to one side, intrigued by the rumor she had just heard right before the commencement of the mission.</p>
<p>“Yup~ Apparently Wicked got herself into a really bad position~ Something about all of her henchmen being arrested~”</p>
<p>“Really? What happened?”</p>
<p>“Well, the truth is….”</p>
<p>Jain explained the rumor in detail.</p>
<p>After the last meeting between the Chameleon Troupe and Wicked, every key personnel of Wicked, including its leaders, were arrested and imprisoned on the 16th floor. Jain wasn’t sure why.</p>
<p>Losing all executives was damaging, even for someone as influential as Wicked.</p>
<p>“For now we’re safe because our goals align~ But after we get rid of Orden, Wicked and other Djinns might try to murder us~”</p>
<p>…Although Boss, Jain, and even Kim Hajin himself weren’t aware, the arrests were attributed to Kim Hajin. One might call it the result of excessive loyalty. Kim Hajin had every single leader of Wicked locked up in prison, all the while being unaware of the incident.</p>
<p>“Then what’s Wicked up to right now?”</p>
<p>Jain grinned mischievously at Boss’s question.</p>
<p>“She’s probably binge drinking~ Also there’s a rumor that says she cries to sleep every night, hehehe.”</p>
<p>“…Hm. Cry? That woman?”</p>
<p>Wicked was notorious for being cold blooded. Sure, she was spirited and cheery, and she rewarded obedience, but she showed no compassion towards disobedience. The number of Djinns she had killed was well beyond four digits.</p>
<p>“You heard me right~ Many people have seen her with puffy eyes~”</p>
<p>For a moment Boss tried to imagine Wicked with puffy eyes.</p>
<p>But she found it difficult to picture any Djinn crying, not just Wicked.</p>
<p>“Anyways, Wicked must be super desperate to ask for our help. She heard we’ve been to the 29th floor, and she was asking if we could ask Black Lotus to help release her people.”</p>
<p>“…And in return?”</p>
<p>Boss put on a menacing expression. She despised people who asked for favors without offering her anything in return.</p>
<p>“She’s offering us the fighting arena in Pandemonium in exchange for our help. Remember how Wicked took over the arena last time?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, arena…. Tell her we’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Meanwhile, around the same time, Wicked was lying in her bed. She sighed as she stared at the ceiling vacantly. She wasn’t sure how she got herself dragged into this mess.</p>
<p>“Damn it….”</p>
<p>Every single one of her executives was in prison. She’d raised them herself and they served her directly. All of them were at least as skilled as a high-rank grade-4 Hero.</p>
<p>Wicked was extremely proud of the ‘Executive Team’ as it was the biggest driving force behind Wicked’s rise to the top.</p>
<p>Of course, losing her executives didn’t mean she got any weaker. After all, Wicked herself was as strong as a Master-rank Hero. But without the executives, Wicked as a group could start to fall apart. She could no longer guarantee they would win against ‘Terror’.</p>
<p>“…Those sons of bitches.”</p>
<p>Wicked clenched her teeth at the thought of the prison on the 16th floor.</p>
<p>She tried to use her connections to pull the executives out but failed miserably. Her attempt to physically destroy the prison also proved to be futile. Not only were the NPCs on the 16th floor strong and skilled, but something called the [System] also drastically reduced all her stats.</p>
<p>—Wicked-nim.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>Wicked shuddered at the voice over the intercom. Recently she’d been overcome with the horror of death. Without her executives, she didn’t even want to think about what would happen if ‘Terror’ allied with ‘Destruction’ and raided Wicked….</p>
<p>“…Kumm. Yeah, so, what?”</p>
<p>Still, Wicked jumped to her feet valiantly. She thought she needed to feign her usual cheerfulness at least in front of her underlings.</p>
<p>—We’ve received a message from the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>“What? The Chameleon Troupe?”</p>
<p>—Yes. They left a message that I think is related to the issue down on the 16th floor. They said they’ll “think about it”.</p>
<p>Wicked’s heart immediately sank, but she feigned nonchalance and nodded.</p>
<p>“Pfft. There’s no way that the Chameleon Troupe would manage to pull off anything <em>we</em> couldn’t do. How funny. …But for now tell them we’ll be waiting, and you should get back to your training!”</p>
<p>—Yes, understood.</p>
<p><em>Tk.</em></p>
<p>As soon as the call was disconnected, Wicked let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“…Dammit.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe her last hope was a pack of thieves.</p>
<p>‘How did it come to this? How can I, Wicked, be dragged down by a mere prison? Does this mean that the executives I personally raised lost to a bunch of NPCs?’</p>
<p>No matter how hard she thought, she couldn’t process the whole situation.</p>
<p>Her downfall was too disgraceful.</p>
<p>Wicked trembled in anger with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Akatrina Continent]</p>
<p>Refugees continued to pour in until daybreak, and we closed the gate after letting the last one in. One of the refugees was the Sword Master, Raylen.</p>
<p>We planned to interrogate Raylen, but frankly, he seemed to have lost his mind as he kept muttering to himself. Because he was clearly not in the condition to hold a conversation, we had no choice but to resort to Aileen’s ‘hypnosis’.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>The interrogation was currently ongoing in the dungeon.</p>
<p>I climbed back up to the reception room on the first floor and rested myself on a chair.</p>
<p>My thought drifted to Puharen. Now that he was fully devilized, this whole quest had gotten a lot harder.</p>
<p>“…So this is where you were.”</p>
<p>I was deep in thought, trying to figure out a way to get through this mess when Jin Seyeon approached me.</p>
<p>I asked Jin Seyeon, “Did you finish interrogating?”</p>
<p>“No. He can’t form sentences very swell. But I’m sure everything will work out because Miss Aileen is trying her best.” Jin Seyeon answered with a small smile. “More importantly, what do you plan to do from here, Hajin-ssi?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Now that the situation had spiraled down to this, I only had two options left.</p>
<p>“We could kill the devil, or we could just run away.”</p>
<p>“…Run away?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We should be able to escape from this world now since Raylen brought the two remaining crystals.”</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t feel too excited about the idea of running away. Although this world was only a manifestation of the past, I had grown quite fond of it. Synchronization was a problem as well.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon also seemed to be suffering from the same dilemma.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it wasn’t like we could just attack him.</p>
<p>Not only was Morax a fully awakened devil, but he was also ranked 21st among all devils.</p>
<p>“The devil that we’re up against… is stronger than the devil Chae Joochul fought.”</p>
<p>Neither Kim Suho nor Chae Joochul was in this world.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon fell silent at my remark.</p>
<p>The silence continued until the morning sun shone through the window.</p>
<p>“Hajin-ssi.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon finally opened her mouth. I looked at Jin Seyeon. She had a big smile on her face that was characteristically bright.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with our current situation, but,”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s tone of voice was always so genuine, without a bit of pretense or insincerity.</p>
<p>It was very soothing, just as indicated by my setting.</p>
<p>“Are you aware of the Kwang-Oh Incident?”</p>
<p>Still, even I couldn’t help but be startled by her question. Jin Seyeon had already asked me about the ‘Kwang-Oh Incident’ before, back when I was Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of it… but why are you asking me that all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon smiled in a mysterious yet all-knowing way.</p>
<p>“Truth is, I’ve been wanting to tell you this for a while.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon said with her gaze fixated on me, as if what she was about to say was something that I absolutely had to know.</p>
<p>“I lost my parents during that incident, just as you did.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 266. Assembly (2)</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I stayed still for a long time. I wasn’t sure how to react to Jin Seyeon’s sudden confession. And while I was pondering, Jin Seyeon spoke first.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been that long since I found out about this. I pestered my friend over and over again… over again… Oregon…”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>My eyebrows naturally furrowed at Jin Seyeon’s strange joke. Jin Seyeon snickered and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m just kidding. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Erm… so you heard from your friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I stared at her face. Jin Seyeon wasn’t meant to be an important character in the original story. Despite having the status of a Master-rank Hero, she was given little screen time. Since I didn’t write anything special about her background, the co-author would have had free rein to add whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>“Friend… Is it Yoo Jinhyuk?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinhyuk was the only one who knew my past and would tell someone else about it. It seemed I guessed right as Jin Seyeon’s flinched slightly.</p>
<p>“As I thought, you knew.”</p>
<p>“He’s a well-known person.”</p>
<p>“Kuhum… Well, to be honest, he didn’t tell me much. I’ve known Jinhyuk since we were young, so I could tell by his facial expressions. He can’t hide things from me, hahaha.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon laughed. But in the next moment, she put on a bitter expression and stared back at me.</p>
<p>“…I knew since a long time ago that there was a survivor of that incident. I investigated it myself. Two years ago, I found out that you, Kim Hajin, might be that survivor, and I’ve been wanting to meet you ever since. Of course, I had to confirm my suspicions first.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s serious voice flowed into my ears. I maintained my silence.</p>
<p>“So I went to see Jinhyuk. He didn’t answer my questions, but his expressions did.”</p>
<p>I didn’t have Chundong’s memories, so I didn’t know what Chundong knew about the incident.</p>
<p>This unexplainable past only proved that I didn’t belong in this place. That I had only replaced Chundong’s place and that the past of the person known as Kim Hajin didn’t exist in this world.</p>
<p>“My father died in the Kwang-Oh Evacuation Shelter. Jin Younghwan, that was his name. He should have been the strongest and the bravest Hero. He met his death while protecting the civilians in the shelter.”</p>
<p>Jin Younghwan. He also wasn’t one of the characters I wrote, but I knew his name from the diary Yoo Yeonha showed me.</p>
<p>I spoke curtly.</p>
<p>“…And what are you getting at?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon smiled. It seemed she made thorough preparation for this conversation.</p>
<p>“No matter how fake this world is… we can’t just abandon it and run away. Just like how my father didn’t escape from Kwang-Oh.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I looked at my hand. The lines of my palm were stretched out complicatedly like a spider web.</p>
<p>“There is this quote from a book I really like.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Jin Seyeon brought up a quote from a book she once read.</p>
<p>“To confront what must be confronted.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>My eyes widened. In this world, Korean history was one of the most important subjects taught in schools. The book, ‘Namhansanseong Fortress’, was naturally a best seller in this world.</p>
<p>“I think I’ve read that book before.”</p>
<p>The only memory I shared with the people of this world, a part of the ‘Earth’ recorded in my setting.</p>
<p>I made a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“Let’s fight, not run away.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon spoke tenderly with a warm smile.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The next day, Aileen approached me while I was stretching.</p>
<p>“What beautiful weather.”</p>
<p>Aileen looked up at the sky with somewhat drowsy eyes. She looked quite exhausted. It must be because she spent quite a bit of magic power while interrogating Raylen last night.</p>
<p>I grinned and spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s the effect of the crystal shard Raylen brought. It improves the weather within a 6km radius around it.”</p>
<p>The two crystals Raylen brought had different effects. The first one improved the weather within a 6km radius, and the second amplified the power of a weapon.</p>
<p>“…I see. I guess I’ll do some stretching too.”</p>
<p>One, two, one, two…</p>
<p>Aileen stretched for about 15 seconds before stopping. She then stole a glance at me before yelping.</p>
<p>“Aah… I’m suddenly dizzy…”</p>
<p>She stuttered like a falling leaf and fell down on the ground.</p>
<p>I stared at her blankly. She spoke with rough breathing sounds.</p>
<p>“I’m hurt.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She wanted chocolate. I laughed and threw one over, and she shot up energetically.</p>
<p>“Anyways, are you confident?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What do you mean? <em>Nom, nom.</em>”</p>
<p>Aileen asked while nibbling on the chocolate.</p>
<p>“I heard you decided to fight too.”</p>
<p>“…Who do you think I am?”</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em> Aileen swallowed the chocolate and glared at me with a pout.</p>
<p>“Old Man Chae Joochul killed a devil by himself, so why can’t I?”</p>
<p>“I guess you’re right.”</p>
<p>I laughed and nodded. Then suddenly, Aileen put on a strange face.</p>
<p>“So, what’s your relationship with Jin Sahyuk? I heard you guys talking about the fake king, real king thing.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that? It’s a secret.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I threw Aileen another chocolate before she could get mad.</p>
<p><em>Nom, nom, nom—</em> Aileen nibbled on the chocolate quietly.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go train.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll let you go this time since this chocolate’s so good.”</p>
<p>Aileen and I then headed to the training hall.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>When Misteltein destroyed the shell of the Tower of Wish, it absorbed a portion of the Tower’s essence. Absorbing this divine power completed Misteltein’s ‘awakening’.</p>

<p>Misteltein’s final form, Wish Sword.</p>
<p>It could form sword qi and sword reinforcement without the use of magic power, and together with Kim Suho’s Gift, Sword Saint, it could even cut space and time.</p>
<p>However, Kim Suho didn’t reveal this sword to the higher-ups of the Hero Association. They questioned his gains from the Tower for a long time, and Kim Suho only replied that he received three pieces of paper and a single item.</p>
<p>The Association heads didn’t believe him for obvious reasons. They even invited an agent whose Gift could detect lies. However, Kim Suho cut the Gift of the investigating agent, turning his lie into truth.</p>
<p>“…Really? That’s all you got from the Tower?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Even Yun Seung-Ah was flustered by it. She was looking forward to hearing what Kim Suho gained from conquering the Tower of Wish. Since the Tower wasn’t destroyed, she hoped the Tower would become Kim Suho’s possession. At the very least, she hoped he would gain an infinite supply of entrance tickets…</p>
<p>“That’s unexpectedly cheap. The journey must have been the reward.”</p>
<p>This was Yoo Yeonha’s assessment. Chae Nayun widened her eyes.</p>
<p>“Damn, can I quote you on that? ‘The journey is the reward.’”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing special.”</p>
<p>“So then what was the item you got?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah quickly asked.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s this.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho proudly explained the rewards he received: [Lv.11 Flying Cape], [Supporter Summon Coupon], and two [Point Coupons]. The summon coupon was especially noteworthy since it meant he could summon the ‘Witch’.</p>
<p>“Oh… I see.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah nodded. The summon coupon sounded useful, though the word, ‘witch’, bothered her slightly.</p>
<p>“Suho, can you write down your bank account?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha tapped on her smartwatch and asked.</p>
<p>Kim Suho tilted his head.</p>
<p>“Bank account? Why?”</p>
<p>“Our guild put a bounty on the Tower. We’re supposed to reward whoever conquered it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah openly expressed her discontent.</p>
<p>“You put up a bounty? Wasn’t that for your guild members only?”</p>
<p>“No, we decided to give it to whoever conquered the Tower. For the record, it’s 10 billion won.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, we don’t need it. We’re not that desp— wait, 10 what? 10 billion?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah’s eyes widened. Yoo Yeonha smiled proudly and nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, 10 billion won. Suho can also ask for items worth 10 billion won.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah became speechless. Korean won was the most stable currency in the world. 10 billion won wasn’t a small amount by any means.</p>
<p>“You guys are that rich?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Even the mansion I live in is worth tens of billions of won.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seeing Yun Seung-Ah at a loss for words, Yoo Yeonha furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you underestimating us too much? Including our subsidiary businesses, we make more in a month than Creator’s Sacred Grace does in a year.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah had no choice but to keep her mouth shut. Essence Dynamics, Essential Pharmacy, Essence University, Essence Foundation, etc…. Essence of the Strait’s subsidiaries were indeed famous and were only gaining more fame as time went on.</p>
<p>“Suho, give her your bank info. Let’s take the 10 billion….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah spoke dejectedly.</p>
<p>“Ah, okay.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho wrote down his bank account. Then, he stared at Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“So….”</p>
<p>His expression turned serious. He had many questions he wanted to ask her.</p>
<p>“Tell me about Hajin. I heard Orden kidnapped him.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s voice was filled with uncharacteristic rage.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Akatrina Continent]</p>
<p>The preparation for the battle progressed smoothly. Plerion’s soldiers and knights were trained day and night, and we planned a strategy.</p>
<p>Since Puharen was overcome with rage and fear, he should lack the ability to discern traps. We decided to use that to our advantage.</p>
<p>We spent the past two weeks digging a huge trap. Inside a hole big enough to fit Puharen’s huge devilized body, we inscribed a magic power powerful enough to blow up any monster.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Plerion’s king, Prihi, personally oversaw the cultivation of crops and raising of livestock. Thanks to her effort and encouragement, everyone regained trust in their king, and Plerion now felt more like a ‘country’.</p>
<p>However, there wasn’t much time.</p>
<p>“…The devil is arriving.”</p>
<p><em>Koong— Koong—</em></p>
<p>On a night of the full moon, the footsteps of the devil who destroyed Schupert’s territory rumbled.</p>
<p>“Yes, I can see him.”</p>
<p>Civilians were evacuated to the farthest part of the city, while we came out to the outskirts along with Plerion’s soldiers and knights. We stood on the castle walls and stared out into the darkness. A devil with a huge body and a bull-like head marched towards Plerion while emitting demonic energy.</p>
<p>“If we can get through this, we’ll grow stronger by another realm. We can do it.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon gave words of encouragement.</p>
<p>“We can return home once this is over, right…?”</p>
<p>“Of course, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Seo Youngji and Yi Yongha consoled each other. Was there really nothing going on between them?</p>
<p>“Quiet, you two. Stopping crying all the time.”</p>
<p>“He’s coming. Get ready.”</p>
<p>Along with Aileen’s annoyed grumbling and Shin Jonghak’s tense murmuring, everyone prepared for battle.</p>
<p>I stared at the slowly sauntering giant. The devil seemed to get bigger the closer it got. My heart beat, and fear struck me. A part of me wanted to run away.</p>
<p>“Huuu….”</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and took a look around me.</p>
<p>Divine Archer Jin Seyeon, Spirit Speech Master Aileen, Assassin Seo Youngji, Hellfire Yi Yongha, Final Boss Jin Sahyuk, and Vegeta/Black Flame Dragon – Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Since I also had the Authority, [Devil Hunter], I believe we could win.</p>
<p>With a trembling heart, I took out my bullets.</p>
<p>“Synthesis.”</p>
<p>I used [Lv.10 Synthesis] on the 300 sniper bullets I had. I fused a hundred bullets into one to increase its destructive power. Then, I added a [Continental Fragment Piece] to the bullet.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Continental Fragment Piece]</p>
<p>—Crystal that maintains the Recorded Past.</p>
<p>—Amplifies the power of the weapon it is embedded in.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The preparation was finished.</p>
<p>“I’ll make the first move.”</p>
<p>I climbed up to the watchtower. At the same time, I activated my ultimate skill, [Complete Understanding of Spirit Power].</p>
<p><em>Tzzzt….</em></p>
<p>Crimson sparks crackled around my body. A sense of omnipotence surged up from my body along with a bottomless supply of energy.</p>
<p>“Whew.”</p>
<p>I transformed the Desert Eagle into a sniper rifle. It was time to apply various strengthening effects to the gun.</p>
<p>I used Random Consolidation System on the bullet and gun, boosted my body’s stats with every effect [Medicinal Memory Physique] had, utilized [Aether] and [Algorithm], used [Partial Devilization] on my right arm, poured 5 streaks of Stigma into the bullet, and even used [Overclocking] to boost Stigma.</p>
<p>“Auu….”</p>
<p>Overclocking used my lifeforce to add additional streaks of Stigma. The process made me twist in pain, like someone was twisting a knife inside my body. Even so, I clenched my teeth and endured until the 6th and 7th streaks of Stigma went into the bullet.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Stigma surpassed its limits, and a clearly visible aura erupted from the Desert Eagle. Magic power and spirit power swirled together to form a huge whirlpool.</p>
<p>This was the strongest attack I could muster.</p>
<p><em>KOONG—!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, the devil finally stepped on the trap. Tree roots and magma erupted, restraining the devil’s movements. At the same time, Aileen activated Spirit Speech.</p>
<p>“A lightning bolt is going to strike down—!”</p>
<p>Lighting flashed, stopping the devil’s movement for a moment.</p>
<p>I aimed my gun at the devil’s vital point, its belly button. Although it was protected by a barrier of demonic energy, the anti-magic property I imbued into my bullet would easily pierce through it.</p>
<p>As such, there was no need to hesitate.</p>
<p><em>Click—!</em></p>
<p>I pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>In that instant, it felt like my soul was being shot out. A loud bang reverberated.</p>
<p>My body shot backwards from the recoil, and the Desert Eagle’s chamber burst.</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAA…!</em></p>
<p>The bullet flew fiercely, spiraling forward with a huge torrent of energy. Even my eyes couldn’t estimate its speed.</p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>The bullet touched the devil’s barrier. Stigma’s magic power destroyed the barrier in an instant and dug into his skin. Soon, it pierced through the devil’s body and destroyed his organs.</p>
<p>—Guoooo…</p>
<p>The devil screamed. He spat out a mouthful of blood before falling down on the… ground?</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Why did he suddenly fall?</p>
<p>“W-What happened?”</p>
<p>Aileen’s voice rang out. She looked just as shocked as me.</p>
<p><em>Koooong…</em></p>
<p>The devil completely collapsed, and a huge earthquake rumbled.</p>
<p>The devil didn’t move even an inch after falling. It seemed as though it was completely dead.</p>
<p>“…The heck? Did he die?”</p>
<p>Aileen murmured quietly.</p>
<p>She wasn’t the only one who was surprised.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak, who jumped down from the castle wall, Jin Seyeon, who was ready to shoot her magic arrows, Yi Yongha, who had his hellfire ready, and Jin Sahyuk, who was watching the whole thing… everyone looked up at me in a daze.</p>
<p>Then, Jin Sahyuk jumped up to the watchtower.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin, you….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was about to say something when she suddenly put on a shocked face.</p>
<p>She shouted.</p>
<p>“Y-Your eyes are bleeding!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I was about to ask what the hell she was talking about when a cough came out of my mouth.</p>
<p><em>Kuhuk—!</em></p>
<p>Blood splurted out. At the same time, my vision turned blurry. I staggered back and forth, feeling nauseous.</p>
<p>“Hey! Snap out of it!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk held me up. I emptied my stomach as she supported me. Reddish-black blood and vomit came out of my mouth like a waterfall. My eyes closed. The last thing I saw was the deep red bloody vomit I spat out.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin—”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s voice cut off.</p>
<p>Several alerts popped up in the darkness. [The devil…], [Devil Hunter…], etc.</p>
<p>But there was only one alert that caught my attention.</p>
<p>[You used three years of your lifespan through Overclocking.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 267. Assembly (3)</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>My consciousness returned. I slowly opened my eyes. From the softness of the mattress under my back, I could tell I was lying in bed. Unread sentences blocked my view.</p>
<p>[New episode complete — You have succeeded in stopping the devil.]</p>
<p>[Because you inflicted fatal damage to the ‘Materialized Devil’, your Authority ‘Devil Hunter’ has been strengthened.]</p>
<p>[Acquired 485 SP]</p>
<p>[Your level of proficiency in the Gift ‘Master Sharpshooter’ has increased dramatically.]</p>
<p>[The maximum outputs of ‘Algorithm’ and ‘Aether’ have been enhanced.]</p>
<p>[Aether partially understands the existence of a ‘devil’.]</p>
<p>[Your physical lifespan has been reduced by three years.]</p>
<p>Out of the many messages, the one that stood out the most was, of course, the message about my lifespan.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>With a sigh, I raised my upper body.</p>
<p>I expected [Overclocking] to have some side effects. I still decided to add two additional streaks of Stigma because I believed one wouldn’t be enough to inflict reasonable damage to the devil.</p>
<p>Of course, I probably should have realized that materialized devil would be weaker than an actual devil, but still….</p>
<p>[Damage inflicted on materialized devil, ‘Morax’ — 96%]</p>
<p>Either I underestimated myself, or I overestimated the devil. I had inflicted 96% of the damage by myself. My single attack probably left it on its last breath, and the others probably finished off the remaining 4%.</p>
<p>“…How do you feel?”</p>
<p>As I was checking my condition, I heard a voice. When I turned around, I saw Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>I answered briefly, “Fine.”</p>
<p>Though I had lost three years of lifespan, it was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>[Abnormal Status]</p>
<p>*Major wound — loss of three years of life (In the process of recovering through Orb of Regeneration)</p>
<p>The Orb of Regeneration was already healing my body. The progress of recovery was characteristically being expressed as packets. It would take the orb three to four months to fully restore my lifespan.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at me in silence. That strange gaze and silence were unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>After a little while, Jin Sahyuk opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“I understand your intentions.”</p>
<p>“What? What intentions?”</p>
<p>How would she know my intentions when I didn’t even know them myself?</p>
<p>Still, Jin Sahyuk turned back without answering me. I took out the magnifying glass to examine Jin Sahyuk’s emotions.</p>
<p>[Remorse, Resolution, Resignation]</p>
<p>I couldn’t understand why she was feeling this way.</p>
<p><em>Kiik</em></p>
<p>Amidst my confusion, the door shut close.</p>
<p>“…What was that?”</p>
<p>I had no idea what she was talking about, but whatever.</p>
<p>By defeating the devil, I was able to claim every reward from this small arc. This arc also allowed me to gauge my strength, and I found out that I was actually far stronger than I thought.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Clear Rewards]</p>
<p>—List of rewards you’ll naturally claim as you proceed</p>
<p>1. Mysterious Magnifying Glass</p>
<p>2. Omnipotent Magic Pen</p>
<p>3. Purifying Crystal</p>
<p>4. ???</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Mmm.”</p>
<p>I was naturally most curious about the fourth reward, ‘???’….</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, with the sound of a chime, a notification window popped up.</p>
<p>[Because you successfully completed this episode, you may ask me any one question.]</p>
<p>[The question may also be a favor. I will grant it if it is within reason.]</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>My eyes widened. I had never seen this type of message before.</p>
<p>These messages were clearly addressed to me from an unknown existence with intelligence.</p>
<p>“What the, who are you?”</p>
<p>[Is that your question?]</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>‘Calm down, me. You need to stay calm.’</p>
<p>“No, no. That’s not it.”</p>
<p>I stared at the window in a daze. Was this the fourth reward, a chance to interact with the co-author? If so, what should I ask?</p>
<p><em>Gulp—</em></p>
<p>I tried my best to come up with a question but in vain.</p>
<p>I came to my senses a moment later. This wasn’t something that I could decide right away.</p>
<p>“…Later.”</p>
<p>I shook my head, trying not to rush myself.</p>
<p>Whether it be a favor or a question, I would have to wait until later, at a more decisive moment.</p>
<p>[I see.]</p>
<p><em>Thud—!</em></p>
<p>“Hey, hey~”</p>
<p>At that moment, the door burst open, and a number of people rushed into the room. Not only Aileen, Jin Seyeon, Yi Yongha, Seo Youngji, but also Prihi and the knights were here as well. All of them seemed surprised.</p>
<p>“What’s up with you? You said the devil was super strong! But you killed him by yourself!”</p>
<p>Aileen shouted in a cheeky tone.</p>
<p>“Ah, well, the devil was much weaker than I expected….”</p>
<p>Now I would have to spend hours explaining to others what happened. I put on a smile on the outside but sighed on the inside.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Kingdom]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Earth, assassination plans were well underway. The Djinns divided themselves into teams and proceeded into the western territory; Heroes, including those who belonged to the Association, proceeded into the eastern territory. Behind this systematic collaboration was a ‘secret pact’ between the two parties.</p>
<p>“Damn, there’s a lot of monsters here.”</p>
<p><em>Tak, tak—</em></p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong shook his hands, and <em>koong—!</em> dozens of monsters fell from the sky to the ground.</p>
<p>“That ‘Monster King’, he sure lives up to his name. He’s got tons of monster followers.”</p>
<p>They were inside the innermost underground tunnel, just outside Orden’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>For an individual team, the Chameleon Troupe was doing better than everyone else.</p>
<p>“…Droon, how far are we from Orden?”</p>
<p>Boss asked Droon as she tore apart monsters. Droon closed his eyes and measured.</p>
<p>“6km… I think.”</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Woo! I see something interesting going on here!”</p>
<p>A loud voice rang out from behind them. Boss turned around. Wicked was there.</p>
<p>Wicked, who had lost all of her executives, came with only about four or five subordinates. They were more a clique than a gang.</p>
<p>“…Wicked?”</p>
<p>Boss quickly understood why Wicked was here. She was probably too afraid to hang out with the other Djinns. It would be risky for her to be near big-time evils like ‘Terror’ and ‘Dread’ without her executives.</p>
<p>“Haha, it’s great to see you again. The reason I came here is-”</p>
<p>“Boss, someone’s coming this way.”</p>
<p>Droon interrupted Wicked.</p>
<p>Boss immediately activated Yasha Transformation. Her body quickly turned black. At the same time, a whirlwind of enormous speed rushed towards them from the other side of the darkness.</p>
<p>Boss knew who this wind storm belonged to.</p>
<p><em>Kurukuru….</em></p>
<p>The faint buzzing of an insect resounded throughout the tunnel.</p>
<p>Boss’ face distorted into a frown.</p>
<p>Orden was not her main target. The one she wanted to kill the most was— the damned insect who once took the life of her comrade.</p>
<p>And right now, that same insect was headed her way.</p>
<p>Boss proceeded to greet him as a true ‘Yasha’.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Recorded past — Akatrina]</p>
<p>With all external threats removed, Plerion quickly prospered. People from all regions of the country rushed into the capital city, and the population of Plerion now exceeded 50,000. Food shortages were easily resolved with the help of Random Dice and the crystal shards. The job market and the economy stabilized, and the country was back on its feet.</p>
<p>“…Today is the last day.”</p>
<p>Currently, we were taking a walk around the central plaza, inspecting the city one last time. The plaza, once barren, was now lively. The surrounding landscape was filled with signs of life: ponds, trees, shrubs, and people.</p>
<p>“It’s regrettable that we have to leave.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon murmured in a rather bitter tone.</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>I answered and looked around.</p>
<p>Our trip to Akatrina had been an unexpected one, but we gained a lot from this experience. For example, Shin Jonghak’s growth, Jin Sahyuk’s change, information on Kim Chundong’s life, and a faint clue regarding <em>my</em> existence….</p>
<p>“But we can’t stay here forever. We have to hurry back. Who knows how many years have passed in the outside world?”</p>
<p>This was Aileen’s remark. She was not yet aware of the difference between the time here and the time outside.</p>
<p>"Well then, let's go."</p>
<p>We got up from the bench and headed to the royal palace. The civilians were too busy living their own lives to pay attention to us.</p>
<p>This was a good sign.</p>
<p>Together, we entered the royal palace. Prihi was in the royal garden, watching the flowers with Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Prihi noticed that we returned, but she seemed reluctant to approach us. It was probably because she sensed that today was the day we would have to say goodbye.</p>
<p>I approached Prihi with a smile.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Prihi didn’t answer. She wouldn’t even look at me. I kneeled down on one knee in front of Prihi.</p>
<p>“Please, don’t be upset. We’ll meet again someday.”</p>
<p>When I was writing the original novel, what I regretted the most was that I released too many meaningless chapters. Chapters that were useless in every way except for the purpose of meeting the deadline.</p>
<p>The co-author must have seen through this. He probably rewrote this ‘changed past’ arc so that it would be useful later on.</p>
<p>“…Is that true? Will we really meet again?”</p>
<p>Prihi asked, her voice a mix of doubt and anticipation.</p>
<p>“Of course. I don’t lie.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Prihi looked at me with teary eyes. She looked like she was about to cry, but she didn’t. She maintained her composure as a king.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon, who was standing behind me, suddenly came forward.</p>
<p>“Those who meet must part, those who part must meet again.”</p>
<p>“…Right. That is the way of the world.”</p>
<p>Prihi nodded and wiped her eyes. And she took out the last piece of crystal that she’d been holding onto.</p>
<p>“Here… take it. It’s the last crystal shard.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Continental Fragment Piece]</p>
<p>—Crystal that maintains the Recorded Past</p>
<p>—Increases the bearer’s wisdom and intelligence</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Finally, we had all six crystals. But it seemed Prihi had something else to give to me.</p>
<p>“Also…”</p>
<p>This time, it was a different crystal. The baseball-sized crystal shined white rather than blue.</p>
<p>Prihi explained.</p>
<p>“This is the crystal that came out of the devil you killed. Take it with you.”</p>
<p>This was, of course, the [Purifying Crystal].</p>
<p>I grabbed the crystal, but Prihi would need this crystal as well. So I infused Stigma’s magic power into it.</p>
<p>Stigma’s magic power caused the crystal to vibrate from the inside and split into two. The size of the two shards, in terms of ratio, would be 8:2. I returned the smaller shard to Prihi.</p>
<p>“This crystal will prove useful to Your Majesty as well. Please protect your world with it while you await our reunion.”</p>
<p>As I was explaining to Prihi, I suddenly felt a fierce gaze land on the back of my head. I turned around, afraid the gaze would drill a hole in my skull, only to discover Jin Sahyuk glaring at me. Her gaze was a combination of sadness, regret, anger, and jealousy.</p>
<p>“…Okay. Thank you. I’ll do as you say.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Prihi nodded with a bright smile. Jin Sahyuk glared down at the top of Prihi’s head. I grabbed Jin Sahyuk by her wrist and pulled her towards me.</p>
<p>“Yes. Well then, see you later.”</p>
<p>I said my goodbye as I brought the six shards together. At this time, Prihi and the knights were already surrounding us. The knights bid us farewell while keeping respectful manners.</p>
<p>—Thank you for everything! It has been an honor to work with you!</p>
<p>The lie that we were priests had long been revealed.</p>
<p>We answered them with big smiles.</p>
<p>“It’s been an honor for us as well.”</p>
<p>I bowed.</p>
<p>At that moment, Prihi whispered to Jin Sahyuk in a very small voice.</p>
<p>—I’m not going to become you.</p>
<p>She could just be trying to insult Jin Sahyuk, but Jin Sahyuk looked at Prihi in surprise. Prihi returned a mysterious smile.</p>
<p>“Now, go. Thank you for everything.”</p>
<p>Prihi said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, it’s been a pretty interesting experience for us, too~”</p>
<p>Aileen answered. In contrast to her calm tone, she looked as if she was about to cry, her nose as red as a tomato. I brought the crystals together before she could start to weep.</p>
<p>“We’ll be off.”</p>
<p>With a dazzling light, the six crystals converged into one, to which I infused my Stigma.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa….</em></p>
<p>The light from the crystal obscured our vision.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Territory]</p>
<p>When we opened our eyes, we were back in the real world, at the exact spot we first met. Jin Seyeon, Aileen, Yi Yongha, Seo Youngji, Shin Jonghak…. Everyone was here, except for Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Ah. So we’re back? I’m kinda sad.”</p>
<p>Aileen stretched her body. A teardrop flowed down her cheek.</p>
<p>“What the. I-I’m not crying. I yawned, is all. I said I’m not crying.”</p>
<p>I first checked my connection with Spartan.</p>
<p>Spartan, who stayed on Earth while I was in Akatrina, informed me of the current situation.</p>
<p>“…It looks like we won’t have time to rest.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Aileen tilted her head questioningly.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because the Djinns’ Orden Assassination Mission is currently underway. The Hero Association joined them as well.”</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, I tapped the smartwatch with my finger.</p>
<p>“Seriously?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Please, follow…”</p>
<p>As I was about to set off, I discovered something on the ground. It was a gem sparkling with rainbow colors.</p>
<p>‘What’s this?’</p>
<p>I bent over and picked it up.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Tower Seed]</p>
<p>—Seed containing the changed world of ‘Akatrina’</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…Ah~ So there was a trick in the narrative.”</p>
<p>I gave a small smile.</p>
<p>[???], the fourth reward of the chapter.</p>
<p>I thought that referred to the chance to ask a question to the co-author when in truth, this seed was the real fourth reward.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people would continue their lives in the fake world within this ‘Tower Seed’. If we plant this seed in the ground, the world of Akatrina as we know would rise like a tower.</p>
<p>“So what are we gonna do now? That kid, Jin Sahyuk, is already gone.”</p>
<p>Just as I was about to sentimentalize over Akatrina, Aileen hastened me.</p>
<p>“…Give me a minute. I have one more thing left to do.”</p>
<p>First, I tried to create a new Gift. According to Spartan— Kim Suho finally cleared the Tower, so the amount of SP needed to create this Gift should have decreased.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Buster Call] [Intermediate-rank]</p>
<p>—Summon</p>
<p>*Using Stigma’s magic power, summon from the Tower of Wish vassals who swore loyalty to Kim Hajin or his possessions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[You need 8000 SP to create ‘Buster Call’.]</p>
<p>[Would you like to save?]</p>
<p>The price had gone down from 30,000 SP to 8,000 SP.</p>
<p>It was more than fair.</p>
<p>I clicked ‘Yes’ without a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>And immediately….</p>
<p>[A huge ‘accumulation of luck’ erupts!]</p>
<p>[Maybe all of your misfortunes have been for this moment! Your Gift ‘Buster Call’ has been increased to ‘high-intermediate rank’!]</p>
<p>[Your luck doesn’t end here! Your Gift ‘Buster Call’ has been increased to ‘high-rank’!]</p>
<p>[In addition, you’ll receive a portion of the SP (2000 SP) you spent on Gift creation back!]</p>
<p>Golden fireworks exploded before my eyes.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Kingdom, Underground Prison.]</p>
<p>Kim Suho entered the underground prison with Yun Seung-Ah. Their mission was to rescue the hostages held captive here. Breaking in was easy since Yun Seung-Ah had memorized the inner structure of the Kingdom in advance.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Suho, doesn’t this place feel kind of weird?”</p>
<p>When they reached the prison, Yun Seung-Ah noticed that something was off.</p>
<p>All of the jail cells were filled with Heroes who appeared too healthy to have been locked up for two months.</p>
<p>Of course, there was the possibility that Orden treated them humanely, but….</p>
<p>“Hmm? What’s weird?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho, who was frantically breaking open the cells, stopped to ask.</p>
<p>With big smiles across their faces, Heroes who had been locked up came out of the cells Kim Suho had just opened.</p>
<p>“It’s just that…. Ah?!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Yun Seung-Ah noticed someone. The moment she saw him, all her doubts melted away.</p>
<p>“Senior Hanho!”</p>
<p>‘Park Hanho’, the chairman of the Temple of Justice.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah rushed to meet Park Hanho, who was locked up in the innermost cell. Kim Suho also recognized him and quickly followed Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p><em>Crack—!</em></p>
<p>With one slash, Kim Suho broke open the prison cell, and Park Hanho was freed.</p>
<p>“Ah, thank goodness. How did you get stuck here? Hurry on out.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah brushed the dust off of Park Hanho’s body.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked worryingly, but Park Hanho didn’t answer. He only stared at Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>“…Senior? I mean, Chairman? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>Park Hanho was silent. A grim sense of foreboding enveloped them. Park Hanho was normally kind and gentle, but he seemed a bit different right now. There was something ominous about him.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah slowly backed away.</p>
<p><em>Tak—</em></p>
<p>But she ran into something. The Heroes that Kim Suho released were already surrounding the duo.</p>
<p>“…Chairman Park Hanho?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho muttered as he instinctively grabbed his sword. He was familiar with this kind of development.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, hi. I guess you two are here to save me."</p>
<p>Park Hanho finally spoke.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a hint of emotion in his nonchalant answer.</p>
<p>A certain premonition crossed Yun Seung-Ah’s mind. She spoke, trying to suppress her doubts.</p>
<p>“Yes. We’re here to save you, Senior. You know, like how you saved me last time.”</p>
<p>“Hm. I see.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho nodded.</p>
<p>However, suddenly, metal-colored magic power blazed up around his body.</p>
<p>“But… you really didn’t need to.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho’s magic power was the sturdiest in the world. It had the very rare ‘unbreakable’-attribute.</p>
<p>Park Hanho, who always stood in the front lines to protect his allies, was a Hero whom others revered and depended on.</p>
<p>“…Suho, take out your sword.”</p>
<p>But currently, there was something different about Park Hanho.</p>
<p>Something about him had changed.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah clenched her teeth and drew her sword.</p>
<p>“I’m happy here.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho whispered.</p>
<p><em>Guooooo…</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge rumbling descended from the ceiling of the underground prison.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 268. Assembly (4)</p>
<p>[Orden’s Territory]</p>
<p>I ran towards Orden’s castle. I dismantled the traps that were on the way with the [Mystic Key] and plowed through any monsters that blocked the way.</p>
<p>But what we were worried about ended up happening. As we got closer to the castle, more and more monsters began to appear until it got overwhelming.</p>
<p>“…Hey, there’s just too many.”</p>
<p>Even Aileen looked dismayed. I couldn’t blame her. Over 10 million monsters stood in the field in front of us. I doubt even Chae Joochul could break through that number.</p>
<p>“Including the monsters flying in the sky and hiding underground, there are about 12 million of them.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon estimated the number with her eyes. It seemed far crazier after hearing about it directly.</p>
<p>“That many? Should we just go back? We can meet up with the Hero Association’s forces.”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>Aileen suggested that we retreat, but I declined.</p>
<p>The number of monsters was perfect to test my third Gift.</p>
<p>“I have a way.”</p>
<p>“What way….”</p>
<p>[Buster Call]</p>
<p>I used 4.5 streaks of Stigma toof activated this high-rank Gift. I was trying to summon Genkelope’s Battlecruiser.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa—</em></p>
<p>Stigma’s magic power shot up from my body, piercing through the clouds and creating a hole in the sky. The light created a ring, which was, of course, a portal.</p>
<p>“…Uuu.”</p>
<p>My head and chest hurt, but I wasn’t worried since I already finished summoning it.</p>
<p><em>Guooooo…</em></p>
<p>Fierce wind blew from the portal. Dirt rose up from the ground as a huge object appeared through the portal.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>What was descending from the sky was Genkelope’s Battlecruiser, a product of transcendental magic engineering found only inside the Tower of Wish. Earth’s current technology couldn’t build even a tiny part of the battlecruiser.</p>
<p>[Genkelope’s Battlecruiser has been summoned through your Gift ‘Buster Call’.]</p>
<p>[The vessel and its crewmen have their specs increased by 30%.]</p>
<p>[Special skill ‘Algorithm’ reacts to your Gift ‘Buster Call’. The vessel’s specs increases by 12.5%.]</p>
<p>[Buster Call will remain active for 36 hours and can be reused after 90 days.]</p>
<p>Such an overpowered Gift had to have a huge restriction. But when it rose to high-rank, it even gained the ability to boost itself and its crewmen. I was genuinely shocked that the only downside of the Gift was its long cooldown.</p>
<p>—Hello, Ship Commander. Is this your world?</p>
<p>Horner’s voice rang out in my ear.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>—Give us your command.</p>
<p>“Command….”</p>
<p>There was only one command that made sense in this situation.</p>
<p>“First, wipe out the monsters below you.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Underground Prison]</p>
<p><em>Guooo….</em></p>
<p>The huge rumbling shook the entire underground prison. However, Kim Suho kept his eyes on Park Hanho without shaking an inch. Park Hanho’s killing intent was clear.</p>
<p>“…Senior, snap out of it.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah’s sword was infused with white flames. She pointed her sword at the man she once respected.</p>
<p>Park Hanho maintained his silence until then. But Yun Seung-Ah felt like she could read Park Hanho’s mind.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah knew Park Hanho was the most unfortunate Hero. His wife and younger sister were murdered by Djinns, and his only daughter died from an illness. Even so, Park Hanho did his duty as a Hero, which made Yun Seung-Ah all the more proud to be his junior.</p>
<p>“This isn’t who you are.”</p>
<p>But it seemed he was rotting inside without anyone knowing. Yun Seung-Ah sympathized with the despair and rage Park Hanho carried.</p>
<p>“Senior—”</p>
<p>“Yeonhee could have been saved.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho spoke. The sadness in his voice was deep and dark.</p>
<p>“If those fools from the Association shared even a tiny portion of Yuri’s Authority… Yeonhee would still be alive.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho spoke with regret and sorrow.</p>
<p>Neither Kim Suho nor Yun Seung-Ah could say anything. Yun Seung-Ah had heard about the rumors surrounding the Authority of Healing. That the old, power-hungry men of the Association were abusing it to prolong their lives.</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t matter now.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho suddenly smiled. The corners of his mouth curled up and stretched to his ears. The eerie smile sent chills down Yun Seung-Ah’s back.</p>
<p>“The King gave Yeonhee back to me.”</p>
<p>With that, Park Hanho unleashed his magic power. It wasn’t just him. The Heroes surrounding Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho did the same.</p>
<p>“You’re out of your mind.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah shouted as she took a few steps back.</p>
<p>“Suho! We’re going to die if we don’t kill them—!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>When Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah were about to begin their fight…</p>
<p><em>KOOOOONG…!</em></p>
<p>A bigger rumbling shook the prison. Of course, the two of them didn’t pay any attention to it and focused on the enemies in front of them.</p>
<p><em>Clang-! Clang-!</em></p>
<p>Swords clashed, creating fiery sparks of ember. However, their fight didn’t last long.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>After about 10 minutes of fighting, when Kim Suho was about to cut Park Hanho’s unbreakable magic power…</p>
<p><em>Jiiing—</em></p>
<p>The sound of a laser rang out, and a circular hole was created on the ceiling. An ‘entrance’ was created, and dozens of soldiers hopped down from the hole. They were all wearing power armor with the word [Genkelope] written across it.</p>
<p>—By Ship Commander’s orders, we will suppress all who wish to cause harm to you two.</p>
<p>With a single sentence, Genkelope’s soldiers entered the fray while protecting Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah. They moved quickly as expected of elite soldiers.</p>
<p><em>Jiing…</em></p>
<p>Magic powered lasers suddenly joined the fight between cold weapons. The outcome was easy to predict.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, near a trap called the Room of Foolishness a bit farther away from the underground prison, a large-scale battle was underway.</p>
<p>“Stay in your positions! Be careful not to get surrounded! We can get through this if we stay sharp and alert!”</p>
<p>Essence of the Strait’s high-rank grade-1 Hero, Kim Youngjin, shouted loudly. Kim Youngjin had entered Orden’s territory as the leader of a 20-member team, which included Rachel, Chae Nayun, Yi Jiyoon, and Yohei.</p>
<p>“K-Kyak! Rachel! P-Protect me! Don’t let your supporter die!”</p>
<p>High-intermediate-rank grade-1 supporter, Yi Jiyoon, yelped. A high-intermediate rank monster was charging towards her.</p>
<p>“Fiery!”</p>
<p>Rachel sent her fire elemental to protect Yi Jiyoon. Fiery’s fire blast scorched the monster’s body.</p>
<p>“Haaat—!’</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, Chae Nayun’s sword slashed down. Her magic power made the blade bigger, elongating its reach to 10 meters.</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>But even with Chae Nayun’s powerful attacks, the team was being overwhelmed by the sheer number of monsters.</p>
<p>“Aaaagh!”</p>
<p>Over an hour had passed since the start of the battle. No one could see an end to the battle, and more and more monsters seemed to be appearing.</p>
<p>“Why are there so many of you—!?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun bellowed angrily, which only made her the target of monsters.</p>
<p><em>Woong—</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun swung down her claymore. A crescent-shaped sword strike cut down dozens of monsters.</p>
<p>“Know your place, you damned fools!”</p>
<p>Then suddenly.</p>
<p><em>Koong-! Koong-!</em></p>
<p>A huge monster appeared with heavy footsteps.</p>
<p><em>Kwang-! Kwang-!</em></p>
<p>It was 30 meters in height, a horn was protruding out of each of its two heads, and it held a large club.</p>
<p>It was a Twin-headed Ogre, known to be one of the trickier monsters to fight among high-rank monsters. Judging by its black skin, it should be from a particularly elite breed. It had to be at least grade-3.</p>
<p>“Hu-man! I- will- eat- you!”</p>
<p>The ogre screamed in human language.</p>
<p>Everyone’s jaws dropped in shock.</p>
<p>A talking monster. By now, everyone knew what that meant.</p>
<p>“…Be careful, it’s a humanoid monster.”</p>
<p>Kim Youngjin muttered with a serious voice. It was then.</p>
<p><em>Guooo….</em></p>
<p>The sky suddenly turned dark, and a giant flying object descended from the clouds. Fierce wind blew on the ground from the pressure created by the mysterious object.</p>
<p>“The hell is that? Wait, isn’t that…?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, who was staring at the mysterious object, shouted. She wasn’t the only one. Members of Kim Youngjin’s team were all elites within the Tower of Wish. They recognized the mysterious entity.</p>
<p>“That’s… Genkelope Vessel?”</p>
<p>The mysterious object looked just like Genkelope Vessel’s battlecruiser.</p>
<p>The team members looked up in shock and awe.</p>
<p><em>Voooong—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, the ogre swung its club at the battlecruiser.</p>
<p>“The- heck- are- you…”</p>
<p>But the ogre couldn’t finish its sentence, as the battlecruiser’s Starlight Cannon instantly vaporized it.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Central Asia.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was looking down at the earth from a height of 500 meters. She could see the several battles happening at once and the countless number of magic power explosions.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to join them?”</p>
<p>Bell appeared next to Jin Sahyuk. His body was wavering like flowing water. Jin Sahyuk didn’t spare him a glance. She was lost in thought, wondering why Kim Hajin sacrificed himself to save the Recorded Past.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>From her perspective, Kim Hajin had done so to cast aside his longing for Akatrina. He had let go of his past self.</p>
<p>So Jin Sahyuk had no choice but to give up on Kim Hajin. The man who was once her loyal servant was now her enemy. She had to admit it.</p>
<p>But the image of Kim Hajin treating Prihi flickered before her eyes. ‘Were we like that in the past? I never smiled at my servants. You were always behind me, and I didn’t know how you felt…’</p>
<p>“Sahyuk?”</p>
<p>Bell called Jin Sahyuk. For some reason, Jin Sahyuk felt like her name wasn’t hers today.</p>
<p>“…What.”</p>
<p>“How was Akatrina? You still want to go back, right?”</p>
<p>“…Cut the bullshit.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk swore to herself once again. That she would return to her homeland once more, even if death is all that awaits her, even if no hope of life exists in that world…</p>
<p>She no longer had the confidence to live in the same world as Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Humiliation and defeat.</p>
<p>Pain and agony.</p>
<p>Regret and sorrow.</p>
<p>Those were the feelings Kim Hajin left in her heart. As long as he wished to stay on Earth, Jin Sahyuk would do her best to live in a world without him because she knew she would only be a target of regret and resentment to him.</p>
<p>“…Bell.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk called Bell in a serious tone.</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>“You said the end is near.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Bell nodded.</p>
<p>“Yep, it’s soon. You’ve heard of ‘Baal’, right? He can open the dimensional gate.”</p>
<p>“…Right, Baal.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was familiar with the name. Bell had always told her to kill him and make a trade with Baal to return to her world.</p>
<p>“When can I meet this Baal?”</p>
<p>“Mm… I don’t know, but I’m sure he’ll appear sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t like Bell’s ambiguous statement.</p>
<p>“Where is he now?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Baal is everywhere. For all I know, he could be next to you at this very moment.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk ignored Bell’s nonsensical joke. Bell grinned and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>“Just wait a little bit. Once he descends, you’ll meet him even if you don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Just as Bell muttered as such….</p>
<p>A giant portal, well over 100 meters in diameter, suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows and stared at the portal. Along with a fiercely blowing tempest, a ship-like thing was crossing through space.</p>
<p>A huge body and a pair of wings that stretched far out.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk knew well the identity of this monstrosity created with magic engineering.</p>
<p>“…Genkelope?”</p>
<p>[Genkelope Battlecruiser].</p>
<p>After appearing out of the blue, the battlecruiser opened its hangar and fired its cannons. Magic powered lasers blasted down, cannon balls exploded, and fighter jets shot out from the hangar.</p>
<p>“Ah~ Looks like Kim Hajin summoned it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“He can do all kinds of strange things. Is this his ultimate skill? How interesting.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s face immediately distorted. ‘When did he learn something like this?’ She thought.</p>
<p><em>B-B-B-BOOM—!</em></p>
<p>The battlecruiser began to rain down fire on the monsters. Orden’s monsters stood no chance against the ultimate fruit of magic engineering.</p>
<p>The battlecruiser attacked nothing but Orden’s monsters… at first.</p>
<p>—Wait! A wanted criminal has been spotted on the east side!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Jin Sahyuk heard a familiar voice. A sense of foreboding overcame her.</p>
<p>“East side?”</p>
<p>‘A wanted criminal on the east side… Wait!’</p>
<p>—I see her too!</p>
<p>—Everyone, change target!</p>
<p>—Ship Commander’s mortal enemy is over there!</p>
<p><em>Whooosh—</em> The fighter jets changed course.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, they were heading over to her.</p>
<p>“H-Hey, wait, wait, wait.”</p>
<p>Of course, she knew this was no coincidence. She knew that she was the wanted criminal they were talking about.</p>
<p>—Capture her!</p>
<p>Feeling wronged, Jin Sahyuk cursed out loud.</p>
<p>“Fuck, why me!?”</p>
<p>The fighter jets already set their target to Jin Sahyuk. Of course, Bell was long gone from her side.</p>
<p>“Dammit…!”</p>
<p>With no other choice, Jin Sahyuk began to run.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 269. Gathering (1)</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, his first thought was that the sky was blue. This thought was instinctual and not instinctual at the same time. It was the product of both perception and intelligence.</p>
<p>The monster stared at the sky in a daze. The blue sky was beautiful, but his first thought didn’t seem like much of a revelation. The monster couldn’t tell whether the idea of a blue sky was a legacy of the past or a fact first explored today.</p>
<p>And so, the monster struggled within the swamp of his own mind.</p>
<p>His intelligence overturned his instinct and dominated his body.</p>
<p>The question of his own existence could not be easily resolved.</p>
<p>—Grrr….</p>
<p>Amidst the confusion, the monster heard a low growl of another monster. It was clearly a sign of hostility.</p>
<p>The second thought arose in his mind at the moment of their first encounter.</p>
<p><em>Who is the monster facing the monster? Is the monster agonizing over his existence a monster or not?</em></p>
<p>To the monster, his intelligence was nothing more than a burden. He felt confused and hollow at the same time. The monster had gained a sense of hollowness along with intelligence.</p>
<p>In the end, Orden was an existence of hollowness.</p>
<p>No one could understand Orden, the first monster born with intelligence. He wasn’t a human, so he couldn’t become a part of the human society; but his intelligence deterred him from adopting a monster-like lifestyle. To be born with intelligence in the land of monsters inevitably led to pain.</p>
<p>But Orden never ceased to think even in the midst of hollowness. He broadened his range of perception and trained his intelligence. He never stopped questioning his sense of self.</p>
<p>His existence, his life, his identity, his emotions, his values….</p>
<p>However, the more he tried to understand his origin, the more hollow he felt. He realized his hollowness couldn’t be destroyed.</p>
<p>So he naturally turned to humans.</p>
<p>Orden searched for the answer to his existence in humans. He studied humans and their behaviors. Just as humans lived freely and naturally, Orden too wanted to feel comfortable with his own existence.</p>
<p>…Then, did Orden understand humans now?</p>
<p>Orden could ingest humans and give birth to ‘monsters with intelligence’ like himself. He could have conversations with the monsters he created. And even though that was fun, it was not perpetual, and in the end he always realized his curiosity couldn’t be satisfied.</p>
<p>Orden wanted an answer. As ‘intelligence’ originally belonged to humans, he assumed humans were the key to the answer he’d been looking for. Orden wanted to destroy humanity for that exact reason. The answer would reveal itself most dramatically at the moment of humanity’s extinction.</p>
<p>In the end, Orden’s goal was neither to conquest nor rule over humans. His desire was not of a physical kind.</p>
<p>He only wished to understand himself.</p>
<p>Orden, as the king of monsters, sought to understand humans, and naturally, himself.</p>
<p>…Thoughts of the past continued to linger.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok.</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of small footsteps interrupted Orden’s train of thought. Orden opened his eyes to discover a small child in front of him.</p>
<p>A girl who had already died once.</p>
<p>Orden had ingested the body of the dead girl, reconstructed her within himself and let her out of his mouth. That was how this child came to live again. Of course, she was not the same as before.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Orden asked, and the frightened child answered, “Daddy told me to hide…. He said this place is the safest….”</p>
<p>By ‘Daddy’, she meant Park Hanho— the most useful human out of all humans he had convinced to swear loyalty to him.</p>
<p>Orden announced coldly, “Go back to your father.”</p>
<p>But the child didn’t budge. He couldn’t tell whether she was scared or not. Orden looked down at the child with slight discontent.</p>
<p>“Um…. Umm…. Ummm….”</p>
<p>The child opened her mouth as if she had something to say, only to hesitate.</p>
<p>Impatience got the better of the King.</p>
<p>“If you have something you’d like to say, say it.”</p>
<p>“Ah… it’s just that… Daddy is fighting right now… can you help him…? I don’t like it when Daddy’s hurt….”</p>
<p>She made a bold request. A small laughter escaped Orden’s mouth, and he immediately wondered why he had laughed.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Orden lightly rubbed the tip of his mouth. His lips curved into a twisted smile.</p>
<p>The child smiled back at him. Her smile left Orden even more confused.</p>
<p>“Hey, you little rascal!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of Orden’s servants showed up. He hurried towards the girl, snatched her wrist, and bowed down to the King.</p>
<p>“I apologize! Come here, stupid human!”</p>
<p>By then, Orden was already standing.</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>Still confused about the reason for his smile, Orden continued.</p>
<p>“She’s right. It’s time for me to step up.”</p>
<p>The Monster King’s voice descended gravely.</p>
<p>“I shall personally punish those who defile my land.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>A mysterious beam of light from the battlecruiser lifted us up to the vessel. We were now inside the ship, with the whole view of the interior before our eyes.</p>
<p>“This is Genkelope’s most powerful battleship. It can sustain weight of up to 9000 passengers and carries about 400 fighter jets.”</p>
<p>Horner, the captain of the ship, explained to us. The interior seemed pretty complicated, as though it came straight out of a science fiction movie, but some parts of it were straightforward since the ship was the combined product of science and magic.</p>
<p>“Wow… but I don’t remember seeing something like this the last time I was here. Is this new?”</p>
<p>Horner nodded at me.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s called ‘Genkelion’. It’s an ultimate weapon created by Genkelope’s AI ‘GenphaGo’ and Ship Commander’s TP.”</p>
<p>“…Ultimate weapon?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Horner smiled.</p>
<p>“We plan to take back our homeland someday using this ship.”</p>
<p>“…Ah~”</p>
<p>I quickly understood.</p>
<p>The Tower Arc had ended, but so long as the Tower of Wish persisted, the world inside the Tower would persist as well. The 15th floor, through indefinite development, was now the most profitable floor in the Tower of the Wish. With further advancement of technology, it wouldn’t be long before they recapture their homeland, the fallen Genkelope.</p>
<p>“More importantly, how are things looking down below?”</p>
<p>I asked Horner about the situation on the battlefield. Before answering my question, Horner pulled up a video in the air.</p>
<p>“Well, there are a lot of monsters. They are not only on the ground but below and above it as well. But you don’t have to worry. Genkelion will not be defeated by those monsters.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>His confidence assured me that my decision to create Buster Call was the right one.</p>
<p>“…Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Shin Jonghak intervened.</p>
<p>Dazed, he looked at me and Horner in turn with a confused look on his face.</p>
<p>“What is this place?”</p>
<p>I answered immediately, “A battlecruiser built by the people of the 15th floor, just as Horner said.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak frowned. His eyes seemed to say, ‘Of course I know that much.’</p>
<p>I smiled. Now seemed like a good time to reveal my secret.</p>
<p>“I own the entire 15th floor. It’s my possession.”</p>
<p>I had rescued its NPCs one by one using the [Mystic Key]. I was the one who acquired ‘GenphaGo’, the AI that oversaw the development of the 15th floor, through my negotiation with the 7th floor Administrator. I also invested a lavish amount of TP.</p>
<p>That was all to become the owner of the 15th floor.</p>
<p>“…Y-You own the 15th floor?”</p>
<p>Not only Shin Jonghak, but also Aileen, Jin Seyeon, Seo Youngji, and Yi Yongha dropped their jaws in shock.</p>
<p>To be fair, the 15th floor must have been a fantasy world laced with magical technologies to them. They apparently had never even considered the possibility that it belonged to someone.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but let’s talk about that some other time…. Hmm?”</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to the video again and saw a group of fighter jets moving frantically.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>Dozens of fighter jets were chasing someone. This person flying in the sky looked awfully familiar. Right, it was Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>—This is the last straw! Get lost, or I’ll kill you all!</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shouted as she continued to run away from the fighter jets.</p>
<p>Horner called somewhere to check and returned with an explanation.</p>
<p>“Oh, I think she’s the criminal you talked about the other day.”</p>
<p>—Get lost before I kill you!</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk aimed her spears at the fighter jets, but the jets, with 50% spec boosts, moved like the wind and easily evaded her attacks. The pilots scoffed and fired their lasers.</p>
<p>—You crazy bastards… that stings! Fuck, that stings!</p>
<p>I made a small smile as I watched Jin Sahyuk swear.</p>
<p>“Just let her go.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“She’s alright now. You don’t have to be so hard on her.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, understood.”</p>
<p>Horner ordered the fighter jets to halt, which they promptly did.</p>
<p>“Next…”</p>
<p>As I was about to give out the next order, Orden suddenly appeared on the roof of his palace,</p>
<p>standing firmly in the center of the spire. He looked like a slightly big human on the outside, one that resembled a lion.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa…</em></p>
<p>Orden started to gather magic power around his hands. The flow of magic power was clearly unordinary. At the point of congregation, a magnificent beam of light stretched out, sucking in the nearby air currents along with magic power.</p>
<p>‘That looks dangerous,’ I thought, when suddenly I received a notification about a change in the story's setting.</p>
<p>[Problem — The main boss of the Third Arc dies too easily.]</p>
<p>[Solution — Increased Orden’s strength. 「9.9/9.9」]</p>
<p>I was lost for words.</p>
<p>Potential 9.9.</p>
<p>This meant he was equally as powerful as a ‘god’.</p>
<p>“…Horner, is it possible to bring in all allies on the ground?”</p>
<p>Horner answered gravely to my serious question.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Portals are always ready to be used.”</p>
<p>“Then please bring them in right now. We need to get out of here. We’re no match for him.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what Orden was planning to do, but I knew we’d all die if we stayed here.</p>
<p>Co-author, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Horner nodded and dispatched [emergency portals].</p>
<p><em>Jiiinng…</em></p>
<p>Beams of light stretched out from the battlecruiser and pulled the Heroes and Genkelope crew members on the ground into the vessel. The fighter jets also returned to the hangar.</p>
<p>I ordered Spartan to take care of the Chameleon Troupe. At Spartan’s current level of growth, using the Authority of Teleportation was a piece of cake.</p>
<p>“Activate Interstellar Migration Device.”</p>
<p>We escaped before Orden’s magic power exploded through the Interstellar Migration Device— a magical device that possessed the ability to fold dimensions, enabling its users to move through a vast amount of space in one instant.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa….</em></p>
<p>Just as the explosion which started at the hands of Orden was about to turn the world upside down, the battlecruiser disappeared from Africa and reappeared in Korea.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[The next day at Yoo Yeonha’s mansion]</p>
<p>The Association and Djinn Association failed to defeat Orden and retreated. Orden had become much more powerful than in the original, and his strength shocked the public. The Association learned the hard way that ‘a large-scale head-on attack was not a good way to deal with Orden’.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>As a result, the media had begun to discuss the possibility of the ‘fall of mankind’.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I came to visit Yoo Yeonha with Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho by my side. The two looked pale, still shocked by whatever it was that they saw.</p>
<p>“You can tell me now. What did you see?”</p>
<p>It seemed that Yoo Yeonha was just as irritated as I was; she pressed the duo to speak. Yun Seung-Ah slowly raised her head. With a deep sigh, she proceeded to speak.</p>
<p>“…She came back to life.”</p>
<p>“Came back to life? Who did?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah hesitated to answer. Yoo Yeonha and I folded our arms and waited for her to speak again. The words that came out of her mouth the next moment were shocking.</p>
<p>“Senior Hanho’s daughter.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Who?”</p>
<p>This time, I asked back in shock. Park Hanho’s daughter should have died. And even in this world, reviving the dead was impossible.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“…It means exactly what it means. Senior Hanho’s daughter is alive. In human form. I remember visiting her when she was in the hospital and I also went to her funeral, yet….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah continued to explain. When they went to rescue the hostages, they discovered Park Hanho had betrayed humans. As she fought Park Hanho alongside Genkelope’s soldiers, she saw Park Hanho’s daughter curled up on a bed in the corner of the room, trembling. Before long, however, the girl ran away, and Yun Seung-Ah, while still dazed by what she saw, was hit by Park Hanho’s shield in the head and fainted.</p>
<p>“I… have no idea what’s going on. But… Yeonhee’s face….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah buried her head in her hands. Kim Suho wasn’t any better.</p>
<p>I watched them for a while before getting up. I signed Yoo Yeonha to follow me, and she did.</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. It seemed now was the right time to gather the Nine Stars.</p>
<p>“I have a favor to ask you.”</p>
<p>“A favor? So suddenly?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha tilted her head questioningly.</p>
<p>“Yeah. We can’t deal with this situation on our own. We need help from the old generation.”</p>
<p>“Huh? By old generation, you mean…?”</p>
<p>The old generation saved the world in the past, and the new generation led the present.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t say that the old generation was replaced. They were simply too powerful. In the present era, only Kim Suho, Jin Sahyuk, and perhaps Aileen and Chae Nayun would be a match against the old generation, and even that was only after they complete their future training.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha muttered in a daze.</p>
<p>“…Are you talking about the Nine Stars?”</p>
<p>“Right, the Nine Stars.”</p>
<p>Orden’s strength was well beyond my imagination. Orden wasn’t our only concern. There wasn’t much time left. It would be too late if we contacted the Nine Stars after the devils’ descent.</p>
<p>“…You’re joking, right?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Even for me, something like that’s….”</p>
<p>“Just fetch me their locations and I’ll do the talking. Oh, I already know where Heynckes is, so don’t bother about him.”</p>
<p>I replied as I prepared to leave. But Yoo Yeonha blocked my way.</p>
<p>“Where are you going? You haven’t told me about the 15th floor and also about that battlecruiser in the sky. Just what is dat, I mean, <em>that</em>—”</p>
<p>Her tongue got twisted trying to speak quickly.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha let out a dry cough and glared at me.</p>
<p>“The Association is calling you about that. You do know that I’m holding them back, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’ll tell you about the ship later. I have a lot of things to do right now.”</p>
<p>“God.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha frowned.</p>
<p>“What things?”</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>I put on a solemn expression as if I’d been hiding something all along.</p>
<p>“I think… I’ll need to be serious from here on out.”</p>
<p>The so-called ‘spirit power’ that I had not been able to figure out.</p>
<p>Now that the situation had escalated to this, I simply couldn’t leave everything to Kim Suho. I needed to train and educate myself to prepare for the upcoming battle.</p>
<p>“…Serious?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked at me with a surprised face.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[April, 1980]</p>
<p>Chae Joochul was feeling nature in the midst of a destroyed civilization. The beat of the beginning, which had originated from the destruction, was palpable. The Immortal released his will into nature, the two forces resonated, and nature released its essence in return. The essence rose slowly and formed a certain figure that soon merged with Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>He had become one with nature.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul opened his eyes as the incarnation of nature. Though he started at sunset, the sun was now above his head. His whole body was wet from blood and sweat.</p>
<p>He had noticed neither the passage of time nor the toll on his body. Now one with the surrounding greens, Chae Joochul absorbed his magic power back inside.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaang—!</em></p>
<p>The magic power exploded violently from within, penetrating his blood vessels. Chae Joochul raised himself. His body was tinged with a turquoise color.</p>
<p><em>Swish—!</em></p>
<p>Chae Joochul spread his folding fan. The essence of nature blazed up from the fan, swirling up into the air. Suddenly it turned into a huge typhoon that engulfed the surroundings. A huge fire flared up within the typhoon.</p>
<p>The harmony of wind and fire was breathtaking. It was a natural phenomenon beyond human grasp.</p>
<p>Such disasters occurred in succession. Red, green, and grey gathered together to form a scene of destruction. All was a grand display of his Gift, [Multi-colored Immortality].</p>
<p>—It hasn’t withered.</p>
<p>At that moment, a gentle voice flowed through the storm into the ears of Chae Joochul. Chae Joochul turned around.</p>
<p>Just as he guessed from the voice, Shin Myungchul, the owner of Seoul and the strongest man of the present era, was standing there.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul stared at him in silence.</p>
<p>—I meant this flower, not you.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul smiled and fiddled with the flower that had fallen on the side of the road. Chae Joochul blocked the flow of magic power. His body that was assimilated with nature was reduced to that of a man once more.</p>
<p>—Your power is amazing, but don’t overwork yourself.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul spoke, but Chae Joochul did not answer. He didn’t think Shin Myungchul was here to meddle with his training. He wasn’t crafty like that, only easygoing and lazy.</p>
<p>With a smile, Shin Myungchul plunked himself down on the ground.</p>
<p>—It’s funny. Usually people who love nature are described as sentimental. But the one person most in touch with nature is completely insensitive.</p>
<p>‘The one person most in touch with nature.’</p>
<p>Chae Joochul knew that Shin Myungchul was referring to him. Naturally, he answered with indifference.</p>
<p>—It’s because nature doesn’t have feelings. Nature only comes and goes, without demanding empathy or rejecting destruction.</p>
<p>That was a very Chae Joochul-like answer.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul gave a small smile.</p>
<p>—You will become a pillar one day.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul also smiled but only awkwardly, as he tried to imitate Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul’s expression turned solemn again, and he asked Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>—By the way… when are you coming back? Seoul needs you now.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul shook his head.</p>
<p>Now was not the right time. He planned to return only after he learned to control his powers more naturally.</p>
<p>—I see.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul nodded and rose from his seat.</p>
<p>—I won’t bother you. Send me a letter after you get back.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul watched Shin Myungchul leave.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul was always so leisurely and elegant. Everytime Chae Joochul looked at him, a corner of his heart throbbed.</p>
<p>But Chae Joochul couldn’t put a label on his emotion. Was it envy, or jealousy, or maybe even hatred?… He couldn’t tell.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul chose to turn his mind to training.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes again and became one with nature, a little better in sync this time.</p>
<p>One day, two days, four days…… at last, two years had passed.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul now understood his Gift perfectly. On the other hand, his ability to feel emotions had deteriorated even more.</p>
<p>He climbed down the mountain and back onto the battlefield full of monsters. But the monsters were simply no match for him.</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, a typhoon appeared; with a shake of his fan, storms and lightning poured down; with a footstep, an earthquake swept through the monsters.</p>
<p>Just as humans treated ants, Chae Joochul conquered half of Seoul with his overwhelming strength….</p>
<p><em>Whiiish—</em></p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul slowly opened his eyes by the passing wind.</p>
<p>Before his eyes was not a distant scenery of the past but a luxurious ceiling. Faced with reality, Chae Joochul realized he’d been having a dream.</p>
<p>It was the first dream he had in a long time.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when Chae Joochul got up from his bed, he was as calm as usual, unaffected by his dream.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat, straightened up his clothes, took a quick shower, and checked his smartwatch.</p>
<p>There were many messages today.</p>
<p>[Kim Suho wants to speak with you regarding the kidnapping of the ‘Girl of Authority’.]</p>
<p>[There’s something strange about Lady Nayun. It appears she has already met Kim Joongho.]</p>
<p>[The Association has called for a meeting regarding Orden.]</p>
<p>[Yoo Yeonha from Essence of the Strait wants to meet with you.]</p>
<p>[Various newspapers have asked for an interview….]</p>
<p>Chae Joochul’s deep, dark gaze ran over the sentences one by one.</p>
<p>The name ‘Yoo Yeonha’ stood out the most.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 270. Gathering (2)</p>
<p>[Orden’s Territory, Underground Laboratory]</p>
<p>Orden visited his lab. When the humanoid monsters spotted Orden, they immediately ceased what they were doing and bowed to their king.</p>
<p>These monsters were not as physically prominent as the others, but instead they were extremely intelligent, and Orden was especially fond of them.</p>
<p>“Stand up.”</p>
<p>The king commanded, and only then did the humanoid monsters jump to their feet.</p>
<p>Orden looked around the lab. The giant egg-shaped capsule stood out the most among the various laboratory equipments. This capsule was a medical device used to heal humanoid monsters who had been injured during the latest battle against the humans.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Orden looked at Kurukuru who was inside the capsule. Out of the six humanoid monsters sent out to fight against the Chameleon Troupe, he was the only one who survived.</p>
<p>“…Although Kurukuru lost, he’s growing everyday.”</p>
<p>A voice explained to Orden. Orden turned around to face the owner of the voice.</p>
<p>There, a human servant with a scarred face was politely bowing to Orden.</p>
<p>“Kurukuru learns from his mistakes. Once all of his wounds are healed, Kurukuru will have become stronger than he ever was.”</p>
<p>‘Lancaster’, Orden’s only non-monster servant, reported.</p>
<p>Orden glanced at Lancaster and turned his gaze back to Kurukuru.</p>
<p>‘Kurrr…. Kurrrr….’</p>
<p>Kurukuru’s eyes gave off a crimson glow as he looked straight at the king. It was his way of expressing ardent loyalty and joy.</p>
<p>“Also, the synthesis of humanoid monster 2.0 has been completed.”</p>
<p>The King was intrigued by Lancaster’s words.</p>
<p>“And do any of them deserve to be called my servant?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Out of 31,103 synthesis attempts, four succeeded. As much as the success rate is low, the results are incredible,” Lancaster explained as he led the king towards the four capsules, “This is it.”</p>
<p>Orden stood in front of the four capsules.</p>
<p>“…What do you think?”</p>
<p>A total of four humanoid monsters. They seemed to possess the characteristics of both humans and monsters. Orden slowly began to gauge the origins of the four monsters.</p>
<p>The first humanoid monster was a ‘Himalayan Mountain Tyrant’; his tiger-like appearance was evident proof.</p>
<p>The second humanoid monster was a ‘Ghost’, characterized by his translucent body.</p>
<p>The third humanoid monster was a ‘Bird of Despair’, possessing an avian beak, mournful eyes, and peacock tails.</p>
<p>The fourth and last humanoid monster was a ‘Golem’, shaped like a human except his hands were made of hard stones.</p>
<p>“These are the four perfect humanoid monsters born by the grace of Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>Orden possessed the ability to absorb and release the energy of others. It was similar to the ‘Qi Absorption Technique’ often found in martial arts novels but more elaborate and unrestricted.</p>
<p>Orden mixed the various forces he had absorbed, reconstructed them in his gut, and released the result through his mouth in the form of a heart. And it was the researchers’ job to look after the heart until it became a fully grown ‘humanoid monster’.</p>
<p>“Please name them.”</p>
<p>The king began to agonize over Lancaster’s request.</p>
<p>Coming up with a perfect name was always a challenging task.</p>
<p>After long deliberation, the king finally announced the names of his new servants.</p>
<p>“I shall call them ‘Tigris’, ‘Xphil’, ‘Doloren’, and ‘Toji’ respectively.”</p>
<p>“…Those are excellent names.”</p>
<p>With flattery, Lancaster began to record a video of the four capsules. He planned to use this video as a means to threaten the country he resented and loathed from the bottom of his heart— England.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Battlecruiser]</p>
<p>I was speaking with the representatives of the Korean government inside Genkelion, a giant battlecruiser maintained by my Gift. Thanks to the power of the [Orb of Regeneration], Genkelion had been running for longer than 36 hours now.</p>
<p>Aileen was by my side. She volunteered to become my patron, claiming that, without the support from an influential figure, the government would consider my opinions irrelevant.</p>
<p>“Yes, this cruiser belongs to me.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>At my remark, one of the government representatives let out an exclamation of amazement.</p>
<p>SP +3, SP +1, SP +2, SP +3, SP +4…. Even now, my SP was increasing in real time, which was not surprising considering virtually all media outlets had covered Genkelion in their news story.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Another representative nodded. I wasn’t sure what his position was, but he seemed pretty important.</p>
<p>Right now, all I knew about him was his name. He introduced himself to me as ‘Baek Joonghyun.’</p>
<p>“We acknowledge your ownership of items from the Tower of Wish. However, we cannot allow you to occupy our country’s airspace again in the future as it will incite panic among our citizens. Of course, there won’t be any repercussions this time, and we thank you for returning our Heroes safely and unharmed. I believe you might even be awarded the Order of Military Merit.”</p>
<p>The Order of Military Merit.</p>
<p>In this world, the merit system in Korea was very systematic and strict. The recipient of the first-class “Taeguk Order of Military Merit” was treated as a member of the nobility.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p>“Will the ship remain in the current position permanently?”</p>
<p>“No, I can make it appear and disappear whenever I want.”</p>
<p>“If that is the case, would you be willing to help us during the third Orden Assassination Mission?”</p>
<p>Baek Joonghyun asked nonchalantly in a brisk manner.</p>
<p>But I was too caught up in the word ‘third’ to notice. Originally this Arc should have ended during the second mission….</p>
<p>“Sure, I can help you, but I believe it would be unnecessary to involve a large number of people.”</p>
<p>I offered my opinion carefully.</p>
<p>Apparently Orden’s explosion completely wiped out all the monsters on the ground, so we wouldn’t need a lot of Heroes this time. What we need instead was a small group of elite Heroes to head straight to Orden’s Palace.</p>
<p>“Yes, we agree with you. But there has been a discrepancy of opinions among us in regards to the size and the standards of the team. We won’t be able to infiltrate Orden’s base without getting past his servants, the powerful humanoid monsters, but victory is hard to achieve with a small number of Heroes.”</p>
<p>At that moment, my self-appointed patron Aileen intervened.</p>
<p>“Yeah, whatever. So what exactly is he getting?”</p>
<p>“First things first, we’re offering bounty for the heads of the humanoid monsters.”</p>
<p>“Bounty?”</p>
<p>“Yes. 100 billion won and an artifact per head,” Baek Joonghyun muttered as he shook his head, “But who would be willing to walk into the jaws of death…?”</p>
<p>“No, not that.”</p>
<p>Aileen suddenly frowned.</p>
<p>“You have to give <em>him</em> something for what he’s already done. Hundreds of Heroes are alive all thanks to him!”</p>
<p>Aileen’s sharp cry felt very dependable today.</p>
<p>“…Yes, you’re right. I almost forgot.”</p>
<p>Baek Joonghyun nodded calmly and took out a piece of paper from the briefcase. It was completely blank. My eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Please write down the name of one artifact you’d like to receive.”</p>
<p>“One? One? Seriously?”</p>
<p>Aileen put on a threatening look again. It was cute rather than scary, but because of her social status, it seemed to have worked well against Baek Joonghyun.</p>
<p>“…Many is fine. Please write down everything you want.”</p>
<p>“Mm… really?”</p>
<p>I thought about it for a moment, but nothing particularly came to my mind.</p>
<p>I wasn’t the type to fight with artifacts in the first place… wait.</p>
<p>Suddenly an idea crossed my mind.</p>
<p>‘Why don’t I get something to use with [Synthesis]?’</p>
<p>I looked at Baek Joonghyun and wrote down the name of an artifact on the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>“Is this okay?”</p>
<p>I wrote [Napoleon’s Musket], one of the artifacts under the supervision of the French Museum. I figured it might come in handy once I combine it with the Desert Eagle.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>Baek Joonghyun stared at the paper in silence. Then, he nodded.</p>
<p>“I believe it’ll be possible.”</p>
<p>“Really? Wouldn’t it cause a diplomatic problem? It’s Napoleon after all.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Baek Joonghyun gave a small smile. He then proceeded to explain in a cold tone that contrasted with his smile, “In this world, under the current situation, there is no country that can defy us.”</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>I realized then the weight and the potency of my setting.</p>
<p>Who would dare defy the world’s most powerful nation?</p>
<p>“At any rate, please do not concern yourself with politics. There will be no diplomatic dispute. We’ll simply be trading artifacts.”</p>
<p>Baek Joonghyun remarked as he glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>It was now exactly 6 p.m.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your time. I shall take my leave now.”</p>
<p>As soon as the promised 30 minutes were over, Baek Joonghyun got up from his seat.</p>
<p>He was extremely punctual.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England, Buckingham Palace]</p>
<p>The Association’s mission failed, but fortunately there were very little casualties. It was all thanks to ‘Genkelope’s Battlecruiser’, which had recently become the talk of the town.</p>
<p>“Phew….”</p>
<p>Rachel, who returned safely to the Palace, sighed as she recalled the incident where she got very close to dying.</p>
<p><em>Tk, tk, tk, tk, tk.</em></p>
<p>A dainty sound of typing rang out in silence. Rachel tilted her head and looked at the couch. On it, Evandel in a cute dress was tapping on her smartphone. Rachel’s lips curved into a smile.</p>
<p>“…What are you doing, Evandel?”</p>
<p>Evandel smiled at Rachel’s question.</p>
<p>“I’m texting.”</p>
<p>‘Texting… that’s right, she’s made quite a number of friends recently,’ Rachel thought as she recalled the faces of the three children whom Evandel had been spending a lot of time with.</p>
<p>There was Yun Haeyeon, her best friend; Leonardo, a nine-year-old boy nicknamed ‘Britain’s Future’; and the three-year-old daughter of Ah Hae-In’s niece Baire Moren.</p>
<p>The first time Rachel saw the girl, she was surprised. It was strange to think Baire Moren, who fought against Kim Hajin in the old days, was married and already with a baby.</p>
<p>Rachel looked at Evandel lovingly and asked, “Are you texting Haeyeon?”</p>
<p>“No,” Evandel shook her head.</p>
<p>“Then who….”</p>
<p>“I’m texting Hajin.”</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>Rachel flinched but soon nodded calmly.</p>
<p>“Ah… I see. Have a great time~”</p>
<p>“Okay~”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>A brief answer. Rachel turned around, pretending she wasn’t interested and returned to work. Today, the workload was especially brutal, as there were a lot of issues she needed to deal with as the leader of the English Royal Court guild.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the meeting with ‘Essential Dynamics’, the 21st recruitment of the Tower of Wish challengers, deployment of Heroes for national defense, etc…… but Rachel’s eyes kept rolling to the side.</p>
<p>“Hehe. <em>tk, tk</em>. Hehehehe. <em>tk, tk.</em>”</p>
<p>The sound of typing and laughing continued.</p>
<p>Rachel couldn’t help but wonder what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Rachel had many questions to ask Kim Hajin as well. For example, ‘what happened with you and Shin Jahyuk?’ or ‘What are you up to these days?’</p>
<p>She naturally turned her gaze to Evandel- to Evandel’s phone, to be precise.</p>
<p>She straightened her posture, trying to steal a glance at the screen, when her eyes met Evandel’s.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>After three seconds of silence, Evandel slid her phone into her arms. Apparently, she didn’t want Rachel to see.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I was- …Evandel, don’t you think it’s time for you to start using a smartwatch?”</p>
<p>Smartphones, which were nothing more than relics of the past at this point, were usually considered children’s version of smartwatches. They were devices that children used before they moved on to the more complicated smartwatch.</p>
<p>“Master Ah Hae-In is already teaching me how to use it.”</p>
<p>As soon as Evandel answered, <em>tiriring—</em> another notification sound rang. Evandel’s face immediately lit up.</p>
<p>She probably received another text from Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Looking at the happy Evandel, Rachel brought her fingernails to her mouth. Then, she began to chew on them.</p>
<p>‘It’s not surprising Evandel doesn’t want me to see her phone. But is there any way I can access those messages?’ Rachel thought to herself.</p>
<p>“…Hacking.”</p>
<p>She’d never tried hacking before, but it didn’t look like it would hurt to try.</p>
<p>‘Hacking, hacking…,’ Rachel repeated the phrase to herself as she frantically searched her computer.</p>
<p>Then she came to her senses.</p>
<p>She pulled up her messenger.</p>
<p>「Kim Hajin」</p>
<p>She stared at the name on the screen for a while, before finally gathering enough courage to send him a text. Since he was texting with Evandel right now, Rachel was confident he would respond quickly.</p>
<p>[Hajin-ssi?]</p>
<p>「Yes?」</p>
<p>And the answer came quickly as expected.</p>
<p>Rachel took a deep breath and carefully tapped on the keyboard.</p>
<p>[Did something happen with you and Shin Jahyuk-ssi? Ah, it’s nothing serious ˃ᴗ˂; Just that she doesn’t come to work now ب_ب]</p>
<p>「Ah ㅋㅋ Nothing happened. We just watched a movie and that’s it. We don’t even talk now」</p>
<p>[Oh, I see… maybe that’s why •̀_•.]</p>
<p>As she excitedly typed on the keyboard— she felt a pair of eyes on her.</p>
<p>Evandel, who had been fiddling with her phone on the couch, was now staring at Rachel. At Rachel’s computer screen, to be exact.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Without words, Rachel adjusted the angle of the monitor so that Evandel couldn’t see. Evandel didn’t show Rachel, so Rachel wasn’t going to show Evandel either.</p>
<p>“…No fair.”</p>
<p>Evandel puffed her cheeks like a blowfish. It was her way of sulking.</p>
<p>[Public anxiety is growing everyday because of the Orden Incident. How’s the situation in Korea? I’ve heard that the number of immigrants have reached an all time high. England is filled with tension. At any time, the monsters in Africa might decide to break into Europe….]</p>
<p><em>Tk, tk, tk, tk.</em></p>
<p>Nevertheless, Rachel kept moving her fingers across the keyboard…</p>
<p><em>Tk, tk, tk, tk.</em></p>
<p>…and Evandel, too, tapped her phone.</p>
<p><em>Tk, tk, tk, tk, tk, tk, tk, tk…</em></p>
<p>The sound of the two keyboards mingled with each other competitively.</p>
<p>Despite the childish nature of the current situation, the tension between the two girls was high.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Underground training room in Pandemonium]</p>
<p>I sat cross-legged on the ground with my eyes closed.</p>
<p>Orden’s potential was 9.9. Anyone would struggle against him. He was a difficult opponent, but that was no reason for us to give up.</p>
<p>As Orden grew stronger, so did we. Unlike the original novel, we had the ‘Tower of Wish’ on our side now.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>I let out a deep breath as I began to make a list in my head of people and things from the Tower of Wish that could be of help to us humans.</p>
<p>The first was Medea, who was on the verge of manifestation.</p>
<p>Second, the cards on the 21st floor— I could really make use of my luck with them.</p>
<p>The third were the numerous spirits residing in the Tower of the Wish.</p>
<p>The Tower would equal an entire army by itself.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>I stopped my train of thought and opened my eyes as I let my breath out in a long exhalation. To my surprise, Cheok Jungyeong’s face was right in front of me. My heart sank in shock.</p>
<p>“Geez, you scared me!”</p>
<p>“…What’s there to be scared of? More importantly, what are you doing here? Meditation?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong muttered, scratching his sideburns.</p>
<p>“No way. …How do you feel?”</p>
<p>From what I’d heard, the Chameleon Troupe had to fight against Kurukuru and other humanoid monsters right after they had infiltrated into Orden’s Territory. Apparently Boss tore off Kurukuru’s legs, Cheok Jungyeong crushed the monsters, and Droon’s rabbit swallowed three monsters alive.</p>
<p>“Is there a reason for you to worry about how I feel?”</p>
<p>However, despite my concern, Cheok Jungyeong only snorted.</p>
<p>“Those monsters are nothing against me.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then get out of my way. I have to train.”</p>
<p>“…Meditation is not training. Why don’t you join me in a spar?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“…Tsk tsk. What a wimp.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong grumbled and left the training room.</p>
<p>Familiar silence returned.</p>
<p>I sat on the ground and began to breathe. The purpose of this breathing exercise was to increase the potential of my ‘spirit power’.</p>
<p><em>Ssp… Huu…</em></p>
<p>Fundamentally, spirit power was the power of one’s soul. As I breathed in and out, I tried to control the spirit power condensed inside my soul. But everything was just too unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I kept trying. Though I already possessed [Complete Understanding of Spirit Power] as my ultimate skill, I would need to learn the basics of spirit power in order to utilize it more effectively.</p>
<p>…There was just one problem.</p>
<p>“Ugh, I have no idea how this works.”</p>
<p>After about 10 minutes, I laid sprawling across the floor. The breathing thing didn’t seem to work, and I didn’t know what else to try because I didn’t know a thing about spirit power.</p>
<p>This just wasn’t how I did things.</p>
<p>Unlike the main character, whenever there was a problem, I relied on ‘modifying the setting’ to get myself through things. To achieve improvements solely through effort— that was not how it worked for extras like me.</p>
<p>…Now, did that mean I had no room left for improvement beyond this point because of my flawed way of living?</p>
<p>“No, wait. No.”</p>
<p>I shook my head violently and pulled myself back up.</p>
<p>Why was I trying so hard? Up until now, I got through difficult situations by modifying the setting. I could still do what I had always done.</p>
<p>[6,083 SP]</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had accumulated quite a bit of SP thanks to the Orden incident.</p>
<p>There was no need for a second thought.</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to the [Arts] tab.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>▷Arts (2/3)</p>
<p>1. 「Parkour」</p>
<p>2. 「Charming Voice」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Ugh, stupid Charming Voice….”</p>
<p>Seeing it only brought back bad memories.</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to add the third Art in the last empty slot.</p>
<p>▷Third Art</p>
<p>「Exuberant Spirit Power Utilization Technique」 [Intermediate Rank]</p>
<p>[2500 SP will be used. Would you like to save?]</p>
<p>The amount of SP needed to create an intermediate Art was 2500.</p>
<p>I pressed [save] without hesitation.</p>
<p>[Saving…]</p>
<p>[Wait a minute!]</p>
<p>[Again, a huge accumulation of luck erupts!]</p>
<p>[What a lucky man you are! Congratulations, your Art has been increased to ‘high-rank’!]</p>
<p>With the work of my luck, my Art had again increased from intermediate to high-rank.</p>
<p>At the same time, a flood of ideas began to fill my head.</p>
<p>How to harness my spirit power, how to utilize creative spirit skills… all those brilliant ideas began to coil up in my head.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Boss appeared from the other side of the training room. It seemed she had just finished her training as she was soaked in sweat.</p>
<p>“You don’t look good. Are you stuck?”</p>
<p>Boss asked me, and my eyes sparkled. My head was bursting with ideas I wanted to experiment with.</p>
<p>“Boss, stand still.”</p>
<p>“…Stand?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I wanna try something out.”</p>
<p>While Boss tilted her head in confusion, I jumped to my feet and redirected my spirit power from my body to my brain.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 271. The Meaning of the Emotion (1)</p>
<p>I redirected spirit power from my body to my brain. The spirit power gathered in my brain turned into something entirely different. Specifically, it turned into words.</p>
<p>[Constructing spirit power….]</p>
<p>Yellow characters appeared in the air, kind of like a pop-up ad.</p>
<p>[Completed.]</p>
<p>Fundamentally, spirit power referred to the power of one’s soul. It was a measure of presence based on the type of experience one accumulated over the years. As a result, the amount and the application of spirit power differed greatly from person to person— it depended on what kind of life one led, or what kind of values one carried.</p>
<p>However, my spirit had a more systematic and logical standard of measurement.</p>
<p>[Exuberant Spirit Power ▷ Your spirit power is like a piece of hardware with a specific algorithm.]</p>
<p>[You may create and utilize ‘Rational Miracle’— your body’s equivalent to software.]</p>
<p>[However, because of the limit in your brain capacity, the number of Miracles you can store is limited to four.]</p>
<p>It was the ‘Writer’s Consciousness’, expressed as the laptop I was given when I first came to this world.</p>
<p>Of course, seeing as I stopped writing my novel midway through, my consciousness as a writer wasn’t exactly firm. But because everything started with my novel, I carried a heavy responsibility whether I liked it or not.</p>
<p>The nature of my spirit power was related to my status as a writer.</p>
<p>[Please enter ‘① Skill Summary’, ‘② Activation Condition’, ‘③ Consumption Value’, ‘④ Affect and Effect’.]</p>
<p>Spirit power transformed into the shape of a keyboard right before my eyes.</p>
<p>My fingers danced on the keyboard as if they had been possessed by something.</p>
<p>My will transformed into words, which then transformed into sentences that formed a Miracle.</p>
<p>[You successfully created the first ‘Miracle’.]</p>
<p>Once was enough for me to understand the process of creation.</p>
<p>I didn’t put a lot of effort into this first one, because I could always delete or modify Miracles without the further expenditure of SP.</p>
<p>[Summary — Summon a spirit doll that consumes opponent’s energy]</p>
<p>[Activation Condition — Reveal the name of the skill to the opponent]</p>
<p>[Consumption Value — Spend 0.5% of Kim Hajin’s spirit power per second.]</p>
<p>[Affect — The doll adheres to the opponent’s body, regularly absorbing the opponent’s energy]</p>
<p>[Effect — Recover 0.25% of Kim Hajin’s spirit power and reduce 0.5% of the opponent’s energy per second.]</p>
<p>[Miracle creation completed.]</p>
<p><em>Plop—!</em></p>
<p>For the first time only, ‘Miracle’ was activated for free.</p>
<p>A doll that looked like a devil appeared in the air.</p>
<p>—Sweck, sweck</p>
<p>It looked a little bit like a badger, or maybe a raccoon….</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>Boss widened her eyes at the sudden appearance of a strange creature.</p>
<p>“Um… it’s Little Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>[Penalty for horrible name — Skill performance has been greatly reduced.]</p>
<p>“No, wait, wait, that’s not it.”</p>
<p>I thought for a while and then changed it to a slightly better name.</p>
<p>“Bloodsucking Cleaner.”</p>
<p>[Plain name — Skill performance remains the same.]</p>
<p>“…It’s ‘Vampire Scavenger’.”</p>
<p>[Better name — Skill performance has been slightly improved.]</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s a skill that only exists in my head….”</p>
<p>I went up to Boss and stuck Vampire Scavenger on her. The Vampire Scavenger clung to Boss’ arm and let out a strange laughter.</p>
<p>—Huhuhung, huhuhung.</p>
<p>“What are you… Eh?!”</p>
<p>Then it started sucking up Boss’s energy. Her shoulders trembled.</p>
<p>“How does it feel?”</p>
<p>“Weird… uuuu!”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you try to pull it off?”</p>
<p>Boss shook the arm that [Bloodsucking Cleaner] was attached to. She shook once, twice, thrice… and she continued until smoke began to rise up from her arm, but Bloodsucking Cleaner didn’t even flinch.</p>
<p>“You probably can’t take it off with raw strength.”</p>
<p>Only spirit power could counter spirit power.</p>
<p>Today was actually my first time utilizing spirit power, and surprisingly, things were going very well.</p>
<p>“…Huup!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Boss activated her Gift, [Infinite Shadow]. As a huge shadow was about to engulf [Bloodsucking Cleaner], I responded quickly.</p>
<p>[Add ‘Affect’ — Nullify the Gift of the attached target.]</p>
<p>[Warning — Consumption Value will increase by 100 times]</p>
<p>The ability to nullify a Gift would be enough to make [Bloodsucking Cleaner] a significant weapon.</p>
<p>But high return always came with high risk. The only way to counter high risk was to add a new ‘condition’.</p>
<p>[Condition — Must have observed the opponent for at least 360 hours]</p>
<p>[Your luck erupts. Despite the lax condition, the required spirit power consumption is only doubled.]</p>
<p>With the addition of a new condition, high return was maintained, and I had already observed Boss for 360 hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, ‘nullify the Gift of the opponent’ activated.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Boss was taken aback.</p>
<p>When the shadows that were always by her side disappeared, Boss looked at me with a dumbfounded look.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>I asked, feigning ignorance.</p>
<p>“…Is this spirit power?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It’s strange. My shadows won’t come out.”</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s because I’m absorbing your Gift.”</p>
<p>“…Absorbing?”</p>
<p>Boss frowned.</p>
<p>I gave a sly smile. Suddenly, for no specific reason, the urge to poke fun at Boss took over me.</p>
<p>“It’s called ‘Succession’. Your Gift is mine now.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t lie. Do you think I’m stupid?”</p>
<p>I didn’t say a word.</p>
<p>For 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Which was enough time for Boss to be shaken up.</p>
<p>“Take this raccoon off of me.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…That’s an order!”</p>
<p>“Haha, I’m only joking.”</p>
<p>“Take it off right now!”</p>
<p>I laughed and took [Bloodsucking Cleaner] off of Boss’ arm. Boss looked at my new weapon with unapproving eyes. [Bloodsucking Cleaner] turned back into spirit power and returned to me.</p>
<p>“So that’s spirit power?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, basically.”</p>
<p>“It’s similar to ‘skills’ from the Tower.”</p>
<p>“Oh… you’re right.”</p>
<p>In fact, spirit power was what made skills possible.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>Boss stared at me in silence before activating her Gift again. She moved her shadows freely, then heaved a deep sigh of relief. I began to prepare another Miracle to experiment on her.</p>
<p>Up next was [Spiritual Bullet]— a bullet that acted on the nervous system, disrupting physical movements.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[East Sea, Hero Military Academy.]</p>
<p>For many Heroes, it was the first time in a long while that they visited their alma mater: Hero Military Academy, also known as ‘Cube’. Normally, outsiders were barred from entering Cube due to the frequent Djinn invasions; however, today was an exception, as the alumni had gathered here for a great cause.</p>
<p>And that great cause referred to the qualification exam for the special elite task force sponsored by the government.</p>
<p>This was how they were choosing the Heroes to be assigned to the elite task force against Orden.</p>
<p>“There’s a hell of a lot of people here.”</p>
<p>A total of 9,000 people from all over the world had applied to become a member of the special task force. While it was true that they volunteered for a noble cause, many of them were also drawn to the rewards.</p>
<p>The first reward was the promise of permanent residency or citizenship in Korea.</p>
<p>If the participating Hero was not a citizen of Korea, he or she would be guaranteed either the permanent residency or citizenship of Korea in return for his or her service. And this privilege would extend to the participating Hero’s family as well. Most of the applicants from foreign countries were drawn to this reward, as it was very difficult to earn Korean citizenship nowadays.</p>
<p>The second reward was, of course, money.</p>
<p>The down payment was 10 billion won and the monthly salary was 5 billion won (the Association assumed this mission would last a long time). Upon the completion of the mission, the participants would be awarded up to 300 billion won depending on his or her role in the mission.</p>
<p>The third reward was an artifact.</p>
<p>Heroes who passed screening would immediately receive an artifact of their choice.</p>
<p>Because of these rewards, every applicant seemed eager….</p>
<p>“Geez….”</p>
<p>Of course, there were Heroes who weren’t interested in the rewards, like Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun looked around the room apathetically. France, Germany, Russia, etc…. The room was full of Heroes from all over the world, but none of them interested Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>—Leclace. You’re here, too?</p>
<p>—I don’t have any other choice. This is the only shot I have left after failing the qualification exam for permanent residency.</p>
<p>—You too? Uhahaha.</p>
<p>Leclace and Levellock, from France and Russia respectively, were both famous in their home countries. According to the Association’s standards, they were high-rank grade-2 Heroes. Still, Chae Nayun was unimpressed. She might have been amazed by high-rank grade-2 Heroes in the past, but things were different now.</p>
<p>“I’m so bored… When is it going to be my turn?”</p>
<p>All electronic devices were prohibited, which meant no smartwatches and no game consoles.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun thought she might die of boredom waiting for her turn to come….</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>At that moment, a figure approached her.</p>
<p>Though his voice was familiar, his appearance was not.</p>
<p>It was Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“Hey, goat beard.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun greeted Shin Jonghak with a giggle.</p>
<p>“…Goat beard?”</p>
<p>“Because that’s what you have. Say ‘baa’. ‘Baaaa-’”</p>
<p>“Baa… No, no.”</p>
<p>With a frown, Shin Jonghak stood next to her. Chae Nayun looked at Shin Jonghak. He seemed much older than he used to be, probably because of the ugly beard.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?”</p>
<p>“…Whatever. Did you already finish the qualification test?”</p>
<p>“I’m a judge.”</p>
<p>“…What? Seriously? Why?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak smiled and showed her his Hero ID card.</p>
<p>[High-rank Grade-1 Shin Jonghak (Rank 315)]</p>
<p>[Vice Leader of Desolate Moon]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“…What the. How are you high-rank grade-1? No, more importantly, you’re ranked 315? Who did you bribe?”</p>
<p>“Ha. It’s simple. I beat up another high-rank grade-1 Hero.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was dumbfounded by Shin Jonghak’s confidence.</p>
<p>At that moment, an announcement came on.</p>
<p>—Next up, Chae Nayun, intermediate-rank grade-2.</p>
<p>Intermediate-rank grade-2 seemed too pitiful in comparison to Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Naturally, the whole waiting room began to buzz with voices.</p>
<p>—There’s a intermediate-rank here? How come this person didn’t fail the screening?</p>
<p>—Hey, isn’t that Chae Nayun, Chae Joochul’s granddaughter?</p>
<p>—No, she probably just has the same name. There’s no way Chae Nayun is only an intermediate-rank….</p>
<p>Chae Nayun let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“…You’re still an intermediate-rank?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak asked, dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so what? I could beat you up if I wanted to. I just didn’t get tested officially,” Chae Nayun claimed.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak only scoffed. Annoyed at the apparent mockery, Chae Nayun jumped to her feet.</p>
<p>“I’m going.”</p>
<p><em>Stomp, stomp.</em></p>
<p>As Chae Nayun headed to the test room, Shin Jonghak muttered from behind, “…Kim Hajin won’t be coming.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stopped.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Just letting you know.”</p>
<p>Still frozen in the same place, Chae Nayun turned only her head to face Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>That was all she said before walking into the test room.</p>
<p>She opened the door, to be greeted by unfamiliar scenery.</p>
<p>“I’m Chae Nayun.”</p>
<p>The test room was a vast field. The sky and the field stretched endlessly in all directions, providing the applicants with enough room to show off whatever it was they wanted to show off.</p>
<p>“We’ll now begin intermediate-rank grade-2 Hero Chae Nayun’s evaluation,” the judges sitting across Chae Nayun announced.</p>
<p>She was familiar with both of them— Aileen and Yoo Sihyuk. Chae Nayun smirked at Yoo Sihyuk.</p>
<p>“Wipe that smirk off of your face and show us what you can do.”</p>
<p>Master-rank Hero, Rank 23 Yoo Sihyuk, announced sternly.</p>
<p>But even then, Chae Nayun found it hard to take her master seriously.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun took out her sword. Her claymore, which was about 2 meters tall, was bigger than its wielder. Chae Nayun poured refined magic power into the weapon she’d taken from the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa….</em></p>
<p>Immediately, magic power blazed up around the claymore. The magnificent outburst was about 10 meters tall, almost touching the sky. Yoo Sihyuk smiled and Aileen watched with a lack of expression.</p>
<p>“This is about 30%… Here I go—!”</p>
<p>With a shout, Chae Nayun waved her sword.</p>
<p><em>BOOM—</em></p>
<p>Her attack continued to swell, drawing heat and gusting wind from the surroundings as it rushed towards the two judges.</p>
<p>However, as her attack was about to strike the judges,</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>A small voice stopped the will of the sword.</p>
<p>A tiny fraction of Aileen’s Spirit Speech transformed into a giant force that bound the swordswoman.</p>
<p>Glaring at the warrior in front of her, Aileen the Spirit Speech user announced coldly.</p>
<p>“Intermediate-rank grade-2 Hero Chae Nayun, you pass.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Late at night, on a vast field in Central Asia.</p>
<p>I lied down under the night sky where the stars and the moon shone brightly. The soft wind brushed past my cheeks; the touch of grass on my back caressing me softly. The sky was beautiful, as if specks of light had been splattered over a canvas full of dark paint.</p>
<p>A plain and trivial phenomenon.</p>
<p>Sceneries like this were rare where I came from.</p>
<p>Though, to be fair, I didn’t even think to look at such scenery back then.</p>
<p>“…Today’s training was fun, too.”</p>
<p>I got carried away by the beautiful scenery when, suddenly, I heard a voice.</p>
<p>The voice sounded strong and firm, unlike me who was always utterly exhausted after training.</p>
<p>It was Boss.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>I gave her a small smile.</p>
<p>Boss and I had trained together for the past week. Boss was a good opponent for me to test my spirit power.</p>
<p>I didn’t have to go easy on her since she could block any kind of attack. I also enjoyed poking fun at her occasionally, though she didn’t even seem to realize that was what I was doing.</p>
<p>“Should we do this again tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I didn’t answer. Instead, I recalled what happened today. About how I gave Boss an afro with my [Spiritual Bullet], about how I manipulated her nervous system to reverse the signals for her arms and her legs, about how she had to do a handstand in the end….</p>
<p>“Let’s do this again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Boss said again.</p>
<p>I would’ve imagined it must be quite bothersome for her to deal with me, but I guess Boss found the whole process somewhat amusing.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve already trained together for the past week, 12 hours a day.”</p>
<p>“…So you don’t want to do it again?”</p>
<p>Boss pouted.</p>
<p>I only smiled silently.</p>
<p>“Can you take off that bear head now?”</p>
<p>For the past week, Boss had been wearing the bear head every single day. I personally couldn’t understand why she liked it so much.</p>
<p>“It’s still useable.”</p>
<p>Boss shook her head.</p>
<p>“What do you mean it’s useable? There are so many better helmets than that.”</p>
<p>“You can enchant it for me, Hajin. Four-colored Enchant. You have a good skill.”</p>
<p>“…I’d rather use it on another artifact. Why would I enchant something like that?”</p>
<p>At my remark, Boss suddenly became quiet. She chewed her lips, sulking, before finally closing the mouth of the bear. Boss’ face disappeared, replaced by the bear’s.</p>
<p>I smiled at Boss.</p>
<p>Then I turned my gaze back to the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the thought of the [Mysterious Magnifying Glass] crossed my mind.</p>
<p>“…Boss?”</p>
<p>—What.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Mysterious Magnifying Glass] [Pinnacle-grade Magic Artifact]</p>
<p>▷Weakness Identification</p>
<p>—Uses magic power to identify the target’s weaknesses.</p>
<p>▷Emotion Identification</p>
<p>—Uses magic power to identify the target’s feelings towards you.</p>
<p>*When the user’s magic power is low, the identified weaknesses and emotions may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was an artifact that enabled its user to read the emotions of others.</p>
<p>‘I wonder what Boss is thinking right now.’</p>
<p>With a grin, I held up the magnifying glass at Boss.</p>
<p>“Wait a sec~ I’m just curious….”</p>
<p>—Hmm?</p>
<p>I would need to spend all five streaks of Stigma to figure out Boss’ weakness.</p>
<p>But her current emotions— that, I could probably find out with just two streaks.</p>
<p>I infused two streaks of Stigma into the magnifying glass.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Before long, letters appeared on the surface of the glass.</p>
<p>—What’s that?</p>
<p>Boss’ voice echoed inside the bear mask. A cold breeze ruffled her hair.</p>
<p>The leaves rustled.</p>
<p>I froze without knowing it and remained silent until the wind blew past us and the fallen leaves scattered.</p>
<p>—…What?</p>
<p>Only three phrases were engraved on the lens.</p>
<p>But they were not the kind of emotions I could simply ignore.</p>
<p>[Guilt, Wanting to be together, Love.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 272. The Meaning of the Emotions (2)</p>
<p>Note: To avoid confusion, 'love' has been changed to 'affection', which is more ambiguous and in-line with what the author intended.</p>
<p>The three emotions revealed by the magnifying glass.</p>
<p>[Guilt, Wanting to be together, Affection]</p>
<p>I could understand the emotion of guilt. After all, Boss confessed that she murdered Kim Chundong’s parents.</p>
<p>But it was harder to understand the emotion, ‘affection’. Of course, affection came in many forms, like fraternity towards friends and the bond between comrades.</p>
<p>—Kim Hajin?</p>
<p>At that moment, Boss called my name.</p>
<p>I was taken aback but answered as calmly as possible.</p>
<p>“Y-Yes?”</p>
<p>—…Wicked asked us for a favor. She said she’d give us Pandemonium’s fighting arena if we freed her executives imprisoned on the 15th floor.</p>
<p>Boss changed the topic of the conversation.</p>
<p>Horner’s excessive loyalty was causing Wicked’s downfall. Although I wouldn’t mind it if Wicked collapsed this way, she had her use. She was far more reasonable than other members of the Nine Evils like Destruction, Terror, and Dread.</p>
<p>“R-Right… then I’ll work on taking them out one by one.”</p>
<p>—Mm, good.</p>
<p>Boss finally took off the bear head. Her eyes were as firm as always.</p>
<p>I stared at her, and she stared back at me.</p>
<p>She probably didn’t know what feelings she had either.</p>
<p>Boss spent her childhood covered in blood and death, being cursed and abused. If I was an ordinary person, I would have pissed my pants if I saw her. She should have lost her feelings in the cruel hell she lived in.</p>
<p>But the current me felt a deep familiarity towards Boss. At times, I genuinely relied on her.</p>
<p>Why was that?</p>
<p>Was it because she was a ‘character’ I created? Or was it because I had feelings for her that I wasn’t aware of?</p>
<p>I looked up at the sky, afraid of meeting Boss’ eyes.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>A sigh left my mouth subconsciously.</p>
<p>If the ‘affection’ Boss had for me came from the guilt she felt towards me, I would have to confess to her one day.</p>
<p>That Kim Hajin and Kim Chundong are different people, that the parents she killed have nothing to do with me. That I’m not a resident of this world, that my past isn’t really mine, and that she doesn’t need to feel guilty…</p>
<p>At that moment, a streak of light fell from the night sky.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>A small shooting star sparkled.</p>
<p>“I-It’s a shooting star. Make a wish. I’m sure it will come true.”</p>
<p>Boss widened her eyes and murmured.</p>
<p>Rather than looking at the shooting star, I mustered up a fistful of courage and stared at Boss.</p>
<p>Boss was looking up at the sky.</p>
<p>I genuinely sympathized about the bleak and empty life she lived through.</p>
<p>Her wistful beauty made her heart beat gently.</p>
<p>“Did you make your wish?”</p>
<p>Boss smiled innocently.</p>
<p>“…No, I missed the timing.”</p>
<p>I muttered in a daze.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, another one might appear. Keep your eyes out.”</p>
<p>With that, we stared at the sky silently. Boss was eagerly waiting for another shooting star to appear.</p>
<p>But there was no such luck, and Boss turned back to me somewhat dejectedly.</p>
<p>“…Hajin.”</p>
<p>She called my name, which clearly wasn’t Kim Chundong’s.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I answered indifferently. Boss looked into my eyes, then muttered fleetingly.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry about a lot of things. I can’t express it in words.”</p>
<p>Her voice reached my heart and spread through my body. Her genuine apology made <em>me</em> feel guilty.</p>
<p>I laughed and shook my head.</p>
<p>“…I told you, you can forget about it now.”</p>
<p>The wish she just made on the shooting star was undoubtedly the same thing.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to Kim Hajin, Boss returned to her room. Spartan was sleeping on her bed. For some reason, he had turned her bed into his nest.</p>
<p>Boss smiled and sat down at her desk. She had many things to take care of before sleeping.</p>
<p>First, she messaged Wicked, asking which executives she wanted to be freed first. Then, she began to reply to the secret message the Hero Association sent in regards to the Orden Assassination Mission.</p>
<p>While she was writing this reply, she suddenly felt a fistful of emptiness in her heart.</p>
<p>As this evoked a powerful feeling of listlessness, she had no choice but to put her pen down.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She suddenly felt exhausted.</p>
<p>She had already achieved most of the things she wanted.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe came to possess half of Pandemonium, she had reclaimed the previous Boss’ authority over the city, and their name was clearly engraved into the minds of Djinns and humans.</p>
<p>The only goal she had remaining was revenge.</p>
<p>“…Bell.”</p>
<p>Boss thought of Bell, the traitor who killed the previous Boss and disappeared.</p>
<p>Just his name evoked uncontrollable rage in the past, but her anger had subsided as time passed until it froze cold.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kim Hajin’s face popped up in her head along with Bell’s.</p>
<p>At first, he had only been a tool to kill Bell. She had planned to throw him away if he wasn’t useful as a tool. Even if he was, she only planned to use him once before casting him aside.</p>
<p>But now, Kim Hajin had a different position.</p>
<p><em>T-Thump—</em></p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>A sudden pang of pain struck her heart. Boss tilted her head, wondering if she suffered an injury while training.</p>
<p>Unable to come up with an answer, she turned on the CCTV that monitored Yi Yuri.</p>
<p>—Droon, look at this.</p>
<p>—What is it?</p>
<p>Yi Yuri and Droon were laughing and talking inside the CCTV. The two teenagers looked happy to be together.</p>
<p>“…These two.”</p>
<p>Boss’ eyes burned as she saw them flirt.</p>
<p>—Look, there are flowers growing underground~</p>
<p>—…Do you like flowers?</p>
<p>Boss’ childhood was wrought with curses and abuse from her parents, and her formative years were spent in self-hatred. There wasn’t a single day that she didn’t resent her parents for giving birth to her.</p>
<p>—Of course! They’re pretty! Why, do you not like them?</p>
<p>—Huh? N-No, I like them too.</p>
<p>Because of this, she couldn’t understand the feelings Yi Yuri and Droon had for each other.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>So she found the scene interesting.</p>
<p>Boss continued to look at Yi Yuri and Droon for a long time.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>One week later.</p>
<p>Korea’s former president and the current authoritative figure of the Hero Association, Kim Sukho, sat on the elegant [Lv.6 Elven Chair] inside his mansion and received a report.</p>
<p>—Yi Panho of the National Assembly was ambushed and killed last night.</p>
<p>—The Association’s executive, Kim Yoonyong, passed away tonight.</p>
<p>—Kaiser, the CEO of Atro Technology, was found dead in his office…</p>
<p>—Black Lotus seems to be behind these deaths.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho sighed hearing the reports. He was bothered by Yi Yuri being kidnapped, but now he had to worry about Black Lotus as well.</p>
<p>“Are you positive that they were all Orden’s dogs?”</p>
<p>—Yes, we found evidence to support it.</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho shook his head and thought, ‘Fools. I told them over and over again not to be greedy.’</p>
<p>—What should we announce to the public?</p>
<p>“Bury it for now. What’s the situation on the special task force?”</p>
<p>—177 members have been selected. They’re all trustworthy.</p>
<p>“…Got it. I’m hanging up for now. If something else happens, you know how to reach me.”</p>
<p>With that, Kim Sukho finished his call with ‘Violet Banquet’.</p>
<p>“Huu… those bastards.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho cursed quietly. He found it hard to believe that his trusted aides had all communicated with Orden secretly.</p>
<p>Whilst he was happy they were dead, he still felt a tinge of regret.</p>
<p>Orden had naturally reached out to him as well. Kim Sukho was still happy with the decision he made to reject his offer, but he didn’t expect Yi Yuri to be kidnapped.</p>
<p>“Black Lotus….”</p>
<p>The new Black Seat of the hunting dogs he once used. He now realized they were too dangerous to be left free.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I guess I have no choice.”</p>
<p>He could only think of one solution.</p>
<p>A group that wasn’t related to Djinns with the power to resist the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>A group of assassins that was founded by a legendary mountain hermit.</p>
<p>Not many people knew that this long-forgotten group had revived in the far east.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho began to write a letter to send to their leader.</p>
<p>An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</p>
<p>That was how he planned to deal with his uncollared hunting dogs.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea, Seoul]</p>
<p>In a traditional-style house surrounded by greenery, Chae Joochul and Yoo Yeonha sat while facing each other.</p>
<p>The young woman in her twenties didn’t cower in front of the Immortal. Her heart stood strong and firm.</p>
<p>“Thank you for taking time out of your day to meet me.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have a reason to refuse.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul contemplated meeting with Yoo Yeonha and found that there was no reason not to.</p>
<p>In truth, Chae Joochul was bored. Other old chaebols were getting together, discussing the Truth Agency or having fun together, but Chae Joochul was different.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha carefully started the conversation.</p>
<p>“I came to ask you for a favor. As I said in my letter—”</p>
<p>“You want to meet the Nine Stars.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded resolutely. She was currently under immense pressure. The residue of magic power Chae Joochul was subconsciously emitting carried the same power as an ordinary Heroes’ attack.</p>
<p>“The Nine Stars won’t be of any help to you. They’re nothing but retired senior citizens. Why do you think they’ve stayed silent? They’re all living in hiding, scared that the side-effects they’re suffering from will get worse.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that. I just wish to talk to—”</p>
<p>“Do you have a way of curing their side-effects?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha swallowed her saliva at Chae Joochul’s question.</p>
<p>A method to cure the side-effects of their Gifts.</p>
<p>To be honest, she had no clue.</p>
<p>But she believed Kim Hajin did.</p>
<p>“…Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>It was the greatest gamble of Yoo Yeonha’s life, stemming from her trust in Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>As soon as she spoke these three words, Chae Joochul’s eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p>He glared at Yoo Yeonha with a subdued look.</p>
<p>“Can you bear the weight of those words?”</p>
<p>“Yesh, I can. I mean….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s tongue got tied for a split second.</p>
<p>She made an uncharacteristic mistake due to nervousness. She felt even more embarrassed because of Chae Joochul’s lack of reaction.</p>
<p>“…Yes, I can.”</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Beeeeeeep—</em></p>
<p>A loud alarm roared from Chae Joochul and Yoo Yeonha’s smartwatches.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was surprised, but she managed to look at Chae Joochul calmly.</p>
<p>“…Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>With Chae Joochul’s permission, Yoo Yeonha looked at her smartwatch.</p>
<p>Then, her eyes shot open.</p>
<p>The disaster alarm signaled a world-wide attack.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[China, Shanghai]</p>
<p>The Monster King spoke.</p>
<p>‘Let the world witness your strength.’</p>
<p>Taking his command, the humanoid monster resembling a tiger infiltrated the city of Shanghai.</p>
<p>His name was Tigris.</p>
<p>He was once the Himalayan Mountains’ biggest Mountain Tyrant. Now in the figure of a human being, he stood in the middle of Shanghai’s streets with a hoodie.</p>
<p>At the moment, none of the civilians around him knew of his identity.</p>
<p>Tigris carefully observed his surroundings, then took off his hoodie. Then, he shouted at the top of his lungs.</p>
<p>“I CAME—! I SAW—! I CONQUERED—!”</p>
<p>His roar emitted an omnidirectional shockwave, bursting the brains of civilians walking nearby. Screams rang out as buildings collapsed. Tigris then began to eat the surviving humans.</p>
<p>The city fell into chaos in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Although the attack was sudden, China’s Heroes reacted quickly.</p>
<p>“Who are you!?”</p>
<p>“Reveal your identity!”</p>
<p>The Heroes pointed their weapons at Tigris, but Tigris didn’t move an inch. To be precise, he didn’t need to. He stood tall like a tree and swung his fists.</p>
<p><em>Boom—! Boom—!</em></p>
<p>Heavy booms rang out, and soon, the Heroes’ heads exploded.</p>
<p>Tigris had killed the Heroes located 300 or so meters away with simple punches.</p>
<p>Although it was absurd, Tigris’ attacks were far from common sense. They weren’t bound by distance.</p>
<p>‘Blows that defied distance’.</p>
<p>Tigris was born with the power to destroy anything within his sight. He called this power, [Boundless Tiger Fist].</p>
<p>“Uhahahaha—! Weak, you’re too weak—!”</p>
<p>Tigris burst into laughter in excitement.</p>
<p>“My name is Tigris! I am the tyrant that will slaughter you all!”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[France, Paris]</p>
<p>‘Doloren’ walked through Paris while whistling and humming. Her voice was as beautiful and enchanting as a nightingale’s.</p>
<p>“You will revive after a short rest….”</p>
<p>Her voice flowed into the ears of civilians, corroding their brains. The civilians who died were then resurrected as zombies who followed her every command.</p>
<p>“Your dead bodies will revive….”</p>
<p>The zombies bit other humans. Seeing this, Doloren smiled.</p>
<p>“The one who calls you shall lead you to a life of immortality. You will bloom anew…!”</p>
<p>Paris’ Heroes came to deal with the situation, but they couldn’t stop her singing. In fact, they were enchanted by her voice and became even stronger zombies.</p>
<p>Doloren’s singing continued until death descended on the entire city.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England, London]</p>
<p>‘Toji’ arrived in London. He looked no different than a human being besides his two hands which were made of rocks. In front of his eyes was the Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>‘Destroy the Buckingham Palace and murder Rachel. That is what the King wishes.’</p>
<p>Toji was given a special command by Lancaster. His duty was to destroy the Buckingham Palace and English royalty.</p>
<p>“Here it is. The Buckingham Palace.”</p>
<p>Just like his name suggested, Toji <em>dragged</em> the earth with him as he walked. A strange earth-shattering sound rang out with his every step.</p>
<p>“Stop th—”</p>
<p>“Who are—"</p>
<p>Toji killed everyone who stood in his way. No one could say more than two words in his presence.</p>
<p>Toji killed humans in an extremely simple manner. He only swung his fists.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But he was soon forced to a stop near the entrance of the Buckingham Palace. A large wolf had blocked his way.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Toji tilted his head. The wolf was too big compared to the wolves he knew.</p>
<p>“…You. Die.”</p>
<p>But his curiosity only lasted for a split second. Toji swung his fist once more. The earth shot up like a whip and flew towards the wolf.</p>
<p><em>Crack—!</em></p>
<p>However, the wolf crushed the earth with his teeth.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Toji’s eyes widened exactly three seconds afterward.</p>
<p>“You, not, animal?”</p>
<p>—Grrrrr.</p>
<p>The wolf smirked.</p>
<p>The wolf’s name was Fenrir.</p>
<p>As Evandel’s first creation, its strength couldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p>“I, see. Aha.”</p>
<p>Toji nodded. Though he understood, he didn’t react differently. He swung his fist again.</p>
<p>Cracks appeared on the earth, and huge explosions happened at the same time as giant fissures.</p>
<p><em>BOOM—</em></p>
<p>The earth exploded, but the wolf used each shattered piece of earth as a foothold to maneuver away.</p>
<p>Toji didn’t stand still. He transmitted his will into the piece of earth the wolf stepped on.</p>
<p>Then, something strange happened. Toji’s original body crumbled into the dirt, and the piece of earth the wolf was standing on transformed into a new Toji that grabbed him by his back.</p>
<p>“I, Toji. Earth is me, I am earth.”</p>
<p>Toji smiled and broke the wolf’s back.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 273. Vow (1)</p>
<p><em>Crack—</em></p>
<p>Toji tightened his arm around Fenrir. A pressure rivaling an earthquake crushed Fenrir’s back, and Toji threw Fenrir aside. Fenrir rolled backward until he struck the wall of a building.</p>
<p>“…I, stronger.”</p>
<p>Toji smiled and murmured contently.</p>
<p>He set his focus back to his original goal, the annihilation of the royal family.</p>
<p>—Grrrr.</p>
<p>But a growl of a different animal stopped him.</p>
<p>Toji slowly turned around.</p>
<p>This time, a house-sized tiger was blocking his way.</p>
<p>“This, zoo…?”</p>
<p>It was then that Toji realized he was surrounded.</p>
<p>The tiger wasn’t the only large beast left. A strange bird and horse appeared in the sky above, and he could feel odd presences underground. Even with his dull senses, Toji knew that he wasn’t in a favorable situation.</p>
<p><em>Ssss….</em></p>
<p>Fenrir then stood up.</p>
<p>Although his bones were crushed and his organs destroyed, the regenerative ability he gained from devouring a troll had quickly healed all his injuries.</p>
<p>“…What.”</p>
<p>Toji’s confusion only increased as time went on.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo…</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, an unknown undulation of magic power erupted.</p>
<p>The magic power served as a medium for a summoning spell, calling a mystical beast to England.</p>
<p>“Turtle.”</p>
<p>Toji mumbled as he saw the beast that was just summoned. The Black Turtle of the Four Cardinal Guardians reveals itself once again.</p>
<p>Standing on its back was the Black Turtle’s summoner, the 8-star magician, Ah Hae-In.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In looked down at Toji from the turtle’s shell.</p>
<p>“You’re a new one, aren’t you?” Ah Hae-In spoke.</p>
<p>Toji looked back and forth between the turtle and the kid standing above it. As he slowly thought about the situation he was in, the beasts surrounding him quickly moved.</p>
<p>—Kuooo!</p>
<p>—Grrrowr!</p>
<p>A tiger and a wolf shot towards Toji and restrained his limbs. From the sky, flying birds sent blasts of magic power towards him.</p>
<p>“…Hehe.”</p>
<p>However, Toji didn’t feel any pain. He changed his body into sand and mitigated the damage from the attack entirely.</p>
<p>“No pain, no pain… huh?”</p>
<p>But Toji soon realized that his magic power was being absorbed. His eyes widened as he looked up to find what was sucking away his magic power.</p>
<p>Six female ghosts floating around the Black Turtle were absorbing Toji’s magic power.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In grinned.</p>
<p>“They’re succubi. Absorbing magic power is their specialty.”</p>
<p>“…N-No stealing—!”</p>
<p>Toji swung his arm. His arm turned into a whip that shot towards the succubi.</p>
<p>The Black Turtle quickly formed a barrier. Among the Four Cardinal Guardians, the Black Turtle specialized in defense.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>Toji’s attack couldn’t pierce the Black Turtle’s [Carapace]. In fact, Ah Hae-In had never experienced the Black Turtle’s Carapace being broken through.</p>
<p><em>Clang—! Clang—!</em></p>
<p>Even so, Toji continued to attack. To Ah Hae-In’s surprise, cracks began to appear on the Black Turtle’s Carapace.</p>
<p>“…Hm, you’re quite an amazing fellow.”</p>
<p>But Ah Hae-In still didn’t feel threatened by it. Although she acknowledged Toji’s strength and tenacity, she knew his magic power was being drained even at this moment.</p>
<p><em>Clang—! Clang—! Clang—!</em></p>
<p>As Toji endlessly attacked the Black Turtle, he felt he was getting sleepy. His instincts told him to retreat, and to him, retreating was easy. He just had to turn his body into sand and scatter. As such, Toji tried to transmit his will to the earth.</p>
<p>However, a cage of magic power suddenly appeared around him, trapping him. He found that he couldn’t transmit his will outside the cage for some reason.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Toji was taken aback. Although he had no way of knowing, this wasn’t the act of a magic spell but a ‘change’ of reality.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>Toji slammed his fist against the cage, but the cage remained unhurt.</p>
<p>“What is, this?”</p>
<p><em>Kwang—! Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>The cage didn’t budge no matter how many times he hit it. But strangely, attacks from outside the cage could enter it. The succubi continued to drain his magic power.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—! Kwang—! Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>“That won’t do any good, idiot.”</p>
<p>As Toji began to crazily pound against the cage, a sharp voice rang out.</p>
<p>A woman appeared in the air. Naturally, it was Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Toji stopped and stared at the woman.</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to escape.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said.</p>
<p>The blue cage was created using her Reality Manipulation. As the inside of the cage was isolated from reality, death was the only thing that awaited Toji.</p>
<p>“…Really? …Huaaam.”</p>
<p>However, Toji yawned calmly. Perhaps because his magic power was being absorbed, his drowsiness became worse. When a golem became sleepy, that usually meant its end.</p>
<p>Toji began to doze off until he finally fell asleep.</p>
<p>“…He’s sleeping?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk murmured dumbfoundedly.</p>
<p>“Wow… You’ve gotten strong, Knight Shin Jahyuk.”</p>
<p>Rachel appeared and praised Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Well… it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had visited Rachel to resign as the Crevon Royal Family’s Knight Commander. It was then that Toji attacked, so she had joined the battle to alleviate her boredom.</p>
<p>“I was recently enlightened.”</p>
<p>After experiencing the recorded past of Akatrina, Jin Sahyuk became able to use her Authority of Reality Manipulation more easily.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In approached Jin Sahyuk on the Black Turtle.</p>
<p>“So, Shin Jahyuk, how do you plan on dealing with that monster?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean? I can just kill him, right?”</p>
<p>As Ah Hae-In and Jin Sahyuk had worked together before in Crevon, they were fairly close.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, he probably won’t die.”</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk tilted her head and shot a spear towards the sleeping golem.</p>
<p>However, her spear couldn’t damage the curled up Toji’s body in the slightest.</p>
<p>“The heck?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned. Ah Hae-In crossed her arms and murmured seriously.</p>
<p>“Black Turtle has the ability to appraise the strength of ores…”</p>
<p>According to the Black Turtle, the strength of Toji’s body was 9.9 out of 10.</p>
<p>“…We can trap him, but it will be impossible to destroy him.”</p>
<p>9.9 was a value that something which ‘existed in reality’ could never destroy.</p>
<p>“It seems Orden created some absurd monsters.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[India, Himalayan Mountain Range]</p>
<p>I arrived at the foot of the Himalayan Mountains to meet the member of the Nine Stars, Heynckes. The travel wasn’t tiring since I just came here with Spartan’s Teleportation Authority.</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>I stared at Heynckes’ inn. It was hanging on a cliff and seemed as if it would fall by even the slightest wind. I looked at the sign that read ‘Himalayan Daybreak’, then mustered up the courage to open the door.</p>
<p><em>Kiiik—</em></p>
<p>A creaking noise rang out, and the man behind the counter listening to the radio looked up at me.</p>
<p>Long white hair that was tied down, handsome facial features, and a scar around his left eye.</p>
<p>Just as I described him in my novel, the adjective ‘aged-well’ perfectly suited Heynckes.</p>
<p>“Is it you?”</p>
<p>Heynckes spoke before I could even enter the inn. As it wasn’t what I expected to hear as a greeting, I had to stop and think about what he meant.</p>
<p>But seeing that I was confused, Heynckes frowned.</p>
<p>“Are you the man who murdered by precious disciple’s brother?”</p>
<p>“…Precious disciple?”</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded at first.</p>
<p>By disciple, he had to be talking about Chae Nayun. But not only was Heynckes unrelated to Chae Nayun in the original novel, but he also shouldn’t have spent that much time with her in this world.</p>
<p>“How long are you going to stand there? Come in, don’t be a wuss.”</p>
<p>“…Wuss?”</p>
<p>If anything, Chae Nayun seemed to have influenced the way he talked.</p>
<p>“What, you don’t want to?”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>I walked into the inn. Thinking about it now, it was obvious that Heynckes would recognize me. As his title ‘Lord of Steel’ implied, Heynckes’ tools all had intelligence rivaling human beings, and they shared a ‘hive mind’ as well.</p>
<p>“If you know me, talking should be easier.”</p>
<p>I sat down next to Heynckes and went straight to the point.</p>
<p>“I came to ask for your help.”</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the radio was reporting on the reason I came here.</p>
<p>—Orden’s elite humanoid monsters have invaded several countries. A tiger monster by the name ‘Tigris’ attacked Shanghai, a ‘zombie apocalypse’ is being reported in Paris, and—</p>
<p>Heynckes turned off the radio and looked down at me. His tall height and tower-like stature made him more than a little intimidating.</p>
<p>“…Making such an absurd request on our first meeting. You’re just like my disciple in that regard.”</p>
<p><em>Tk.</em></p>
<p>Heynckes took out a wooden cup and poured some vodka into it.</p>
<p>“I said the same thing to my disciple. My body isn’t in a state to fight anyone.”</p>
<p>“If the Nine Stars won’t fight, then who—”</p>
<p>“The Nine Stars were the Nine Stars 50 years ago, kid.”</p>
<p>Heynckes cut me off and handed me the vodka.</p>
<p>I looked back and forth between the cup and Heynckes, then chugged the vodka in one go. It felt like a small fire was lit inside me.</p>
<p>“Kuhum… If you’re worried about the side-effect, I can help you with it.”</p>
<p>The side-effect of Heynckes’ ability was ‘Steel Transformation’.</p>
<p>As the Lord of Steel, Heynckes transformed his body into steel. To be precise, he turned his internal organs, spine, and left eye into ‘steel possessing his will’. However, at one point Heynckes’ Authority didn’t stop there and rampaged.</p>
<p>To him, time became a one-way road to complete steelification of his body. As time went by, more and more parts of his body turned into steel, including his brain and blood. He was destined to become a chunk of steel and die.</p>
<p>However, I had herbs that could only be found within the Tower of Wish. By mixing them and using the power of my Setting Intervention, I should be able to create medicine to undo this side-effect.</p>
<p>“I know how to heal the side-effects you’re suffering from.”</p>
<p>The Nine Stars hated having the side-effects of their powers mentioned. So I was risking my life to be here.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Heynckes looked at me quietly. His left eye turned grey before I realized. His Steel Eye experienced the world in one-millionth of normal speed, and it was specialized for detecting truth.</p>
<p>Heynckes glared at me and spoke.</p>
<p>“Es ist wahr.”</p>
<p>It was German, but I translated it using the laptop in my head.</p>
<p>He was asking if it was true.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>When I answered, Heynckes’ eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p>I stood nervously, but what he said afterward caught me by surprise.</p>
<p>“You learned German?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“I asked if you learned German.”</p>
<p>“Ah… yes, a little.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Heynckes’ left eye returned to normal color. He was noticeably less cautious than before.</p>
<p>He smiled gently.</p>
<p>“Why would you learn such a thing? It’s not the 1980s anymore.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, um….”</p>
<p>This world was different than the world I came from. It was easy to see since Korea was the world’s sole superpower here.</p>
<p>Since Korean was the world’s shared language, there weren’t many interpreters or translators. And since most academic papers and official documents were written in Korean, Koreans had no reason to learn foreign languages.</p>
<p>“…I learned it since I know you are German.”</p>
<p>“Mm, is that so? You’ve got manners. How much have you learned?”</p>
<p>“I should be able to communicate normally.”</p>
<p>“Oh, wirklich?”</p>
<p>Hyenckes laughed heartily. I didn’t remember giving him such a setting, but he was a bigger patriot than I thought.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s another story.”</p>
<p>Heynckes put on a serious expression once again.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I have no intention of curing my side-effect.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>I was taken aback. Heynckes’ side-effect should have been one of the worst among the Nine Stars, but he didn’t want to reverse it?</p>
<p>Heynckes continued, “When I was young, I was afraid of dying. That’s why I escaped to this place. But it’s different now. If someone my age is afraid of death, then he hasn’t matured enough.”</p>
<p>“…Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, really. But there is one thing I want from you.”</p>
<p>Thankfully it seemed there was something I could do.</p>
<p>I quickly nodded, and Heynckes spoke with a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>“Settle things with my disciple.”</p>
<p>Silence descended. I replied exactly three seconds afterward.</p>
<p>“…Hah?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how. Just settle things with her.”</p>
<p>An innocent smile emerged on Heynckes’ face.</p>
<p>“…You mean, with Chae Nayun?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t an offer I could accept so easily.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what Heynckes knew, but my relationship with Chae Nayun wasn’t something that could be fixed in a few sentences.</p>
<p>“…Um, that’s not something that can be solved that easily—”</p>
<p>“My disciple and I both know everything about you. Chae Nayun knows the truth behind Chae Jinyoon’s death, like why you killed Chae Jinyoon and what state he was in.”</p>
<p>“…I know that too.”</p>
<p>I’d heard about it from Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Then that’s an even bigger problem. Why are you hesitating? What a wuss.”</p>
<p>Heynckes crossed his arms like he was looking at a fool.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>If Chae Nayun were here, I felt like she would have said this, ‘That’s none of your business, old man.’</p>
<p>But I wasn’t Chae Nayun. After thinking about what he said for a moment, I stealthily checked his potential.</p>
<p>[Heynckes]</p>
<p>[9.75/9.6]</p>
<p>9.75 ability.</p>
<p>9.6 potential.</p>
<p>The values didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>But I understood after a moment.</p>
<p>Heynckes was a special case in that his ability was higher than his potential. His [Steel Transformation] side-effect made him stronger than what his potential allowed. He was someone who grew stronger as he neared death.</p>
<p>“So? What’s your answer?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I stared at Heynckes silently. With a 9.75 ability rating, he was more than capable of contending with Orden. I had no choice but to listen to his request.</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
<p>Heynckes immediately put on a big smile. He nodded contently, then suddenly took out a dagger.</p>
<p>“Then feed this dagger your blood and make a vow.”</p>
<p>“…A vow?”</p>
<p>“This dagger contains my ‘Will of Covenant’. If you don’t keep the vow you make, this dagger will pierce your heart.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I glanced at the dagger.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Covenant Dagger] [Product of an Authority] [Steel-attribute]</p>
<p>—A dagger containing the will of Heynckes’ Steel Spirit.</p>
<p>「Covenant」</p>
<p>—Upon feeding this dagger blood and making a vow, the vow <em>must</em> be kept.</p>
<p>—If the vow is not fulfilled, this dagger <em>will</em> pierce the heart of the one who failed to keep the vow.</p>
<p>—The person whose heart is pierced by this dagger <em>will</em> die.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The item description put a strong emphasis on the absoluteness of the dagger’s ability. It showed a little bit of Heynckes’ true ability, as Shin Myungchul was the only one to have ever defeated him.</p>
<p>“I’m being generous. From what I heard from my disciple, I think of you as a man among men.”</p>
<p>Heynckes handed me the dagger.</p>
<p>“If you make this vow, I, Heynckes, will do the same. That I will kill this Orden you speak of.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I hesitated slightly, but the answer was obvious.</p>
<p>It was a cheap price to make a member of the Nine Stars my ally. Plus, I had to meet with Chae Nayun eventually.</p>
<p>“…Fine. I’ll accept it.”</p>
<p>I mustered up my courage and nodded.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 274. Vow (2)</p>
<p>Despite the sudden eruption of calamities, Yoo Yeonha finished her meeting with Chae Joochul as planned. She achieved her initial goal through persistent persuasion. Chae Joochul promised to introduce Yoo Yeonha to ‘Oh Jaejin’, a member of the Nine Stars.</p>
<p>Now, their meeting was over, and Yoo Yeonha staggered back to her limousine.</p>
<p>“Are you feeling okay?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s secretary, Jin Sechan, asked the moment she got into the car.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shook her head. She was feeling dizzy and even nauseous from exposure to Chae Joochul’s magic power.</p>
<p>“Let’s go home. I need to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.”</p>
<p>Jin Sechan was a competent secretary. He adjusted the internal temperature of the limousine to the optimal temperature, installed a mana stone with air cleaning and purifying function, then turned up the speaker volume so that his boss could hear the reports made by the members of the Falling Blossom guild.</p>
<p>—China, four guilds based in Shanghai have been completely exterminated.</p>
<p>—France, Paris has been sealed off.</p>
<p>—England, subjugation was successful.</p>
<p>—Canada, sudden deaths are becoming frequent. Multiple witnesses have reported the sighting of a ghost.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha listened to the reports with her eyes closed. Countries were being destroyed and civilians were being killed, but Yoo Yeonha felt no sympathy. Rather, she began to calculate the profits her guild would gain from the incidents.</p>
<p>“…Have we been asked for aid?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Different countries have asked for our Heroes and our potions. They would like to discuss the prices later, and-”</p>
<p>“Reject the request for Heroes, but tell them we’ll provide potions. You know, the new ones, [Essence of Recovery] and [Essence of Bravery].”</p>
<p>Considering the circumstances, it would be foolish of her to dispatch her Heroes to what would most likely cost them their lives.</p>
<p>But potions were risk-free.</p>
<p>‘Essence Pharmacy’ had recently developed two new potions. Since consumers weren’t as willing to purchase anything new, providing other countries with these potions for free would be a good marketing strategy.</p>
<p>“Send the potions to the three countries without charge.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.”</p>
<p>Those in dire need of potions weren’t exactly in the position to be picky. Just as the saying goes, beggars can't be choosers. This was her chance to improve her company’s public image and to promote her products at the same time.</p>
<p>“Now, please leave me alone.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha leaned back in her seat and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss.”</p>
<p>Jin Sechan drove cautiously to provide his boss a comfortable ride. He glanced at Yoo Yeonha through the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked incredibly beautiful in her sleep.</p>
<p>He couldn’t suppress the unbearable surge of emotions in his heart. Though he had told himself thousands of times that his love could never come true, it never died out.</p>
<p>Jin Sechan tried to keep calm. He held back, trying to convince himself that he could still love her without the need to call her his own.</p>
<p>—We’ll let you have her.</p>
<p>But why did the offer proposed by Orden’s servant suddenly cross his mind?</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sechan tightened his grip around the steering wheel, condemning his foolish desire.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>After I made the vow to Heynckes, I headed to the [World of Wish].</p>
<p>Originally called the Tower of Wish, it was renamed after Kim Suho destroyed the Tower’s outer shell. Its slogan had also changed from ‘the tower full of humanity’s wishes' to ‘the world where humanity’s wishes come true’.</p>
<p>In any case, I was back on the 15th floor in Genkelope's Vessel. I was to here to release Wicked’s executives just as I had promised.</p>
<p>“…Are you sure?”</p>
<p>In front of the [Genekelope Prison], the most notorious facility on the 15th floor, Horner asked me worriedly. His concern was well grounded. I sympathized with him, since he told me what those Djinns had done to get themselves locked up.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. Let’s go inside.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>With Horner, I entered the prison, dressed as Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>The prison conditions were surprisingly good. Most rooms were equipped with a bed and a TV, bathrooms were separate, and most importantly, food was decent.</p>
<p>“This place is actually nice.”</p>
<p>“Everyone still wants to get out. Most inmates are Players- 310 out of 317, to be exact. Life inside the prison is easy, it’s the labor that’s hard….”</p>
<p>I listened to Horner explain as we headed deeper into the prison.</p>
<p>However, as we walked on, I noticed the hallway was getting darker, and the facilities quickly began to deteriorate.</p>
<p>“This is it.”</p>
<p>We finally reached the very end of the basement floor.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words when I saw the inhumane condition of the cell in which Wicked’s executives were kept.</p>
<p>There wasn’t even a bed, let alone a TV. There wasn’t a separate bathroom either. The floor and walls were covered in filth. The cell was completely empty, so there was nothing for them to do to pass their time.</p>
<p>I carefully looked inside. In the cramped cell, six executives lay in silence.</p>
<p>“Wake them up.”</p>
<p>At Horner’s command, the prison guard rattled the bars.</p>
<p><em>Kwang, kwang, kwang!</em></p>
<p>“Huaaak!”</p>
<p>Startled, the executives sat up and looked at Horner and me. Their bloodshot eyes trembled with fear and dread.</p>
<p>I studied them for a moment and asked, “Which one of you is Kirkin?”</p>
<p>“W-Why do you ask….”</p>
<p>The executives shuddered.</p>
<p>These were Wicked’s executives, which meant they were at least as strong as high-rank Heroes. It was strange for me to see them in such a horrified state.</p>
<p>My guess was that the deterioration of their physical health also led to the deterioration of their mental health.</p>
<p>“Don’t make me ask twice,” I said coldly, at which the skinniest Djinn raised his hand, trembling with fear.</p>
<p>“I-It’s me.”</p>
<p>Kirkin was Wicked’s right-hand man. But now, his former glory was tarnished by all the bruises on his body.</p>
<p>“Come closer.”</p>
<p>Kirkin did as he was told, all the while trembling in fear. His obedience appeared to be the product of a long period of cruel treatment.</p>
<p>“Open the door.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>The prison guard unlocked the door, and Kirkin stepped out of the cell with his head down.</p>
<p>“Kirkin, do you recognize me?” I asked.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Kirkin slowly lifted his head. My body and face were hidden beneath the hood and the robe, but the black lotus symbol on my robe was recognizable from miles away.</p>
<p>KIrkin widened his eyes and nodded.</p>
<p>“B-Black Lotus….”</p>
<p>“Correct. I’m here on behalf of your boss, Wicked. She asked me to release you.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>KIrkin’s eyes twinkled with a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>He asked back, swallowing his saliva.</p>
<p>“D-dOes that mean…?”</p>
<p>I exchanged glances with the guard next to me.</p>
<p>The prison guard answered him for me.</p>
<p>“Inmate Kirkin, you have been granted ‘Ranker’s Amnesty’. You better thank the Ranker, Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Wicked’s Sanctuary]</p>
<p>…Four months had passed since ‘the incident’.</p>
<p>Wicked, despite her success a few months earlier, couldn’t even step a foot outside her sanctuary. Everyone knew her executives were missing, which made her an easy target for assassination.</p>
<p>“…Huek!”</p>
<p>Wicked woke up from a nightmare, shaking.</p>
<p>Her soft skin had long turned coarse, and her eyes that once twinkled with confidence were now dead.</p>
<p>She was completely ruined.</p>
<p>“Haaa, haaa….”</p>
<p>She breathed in and out, trying to calm herself down. As she slowly settled down, tears suddenly started to gather in her eyes.</p>
<p>“…How did I end up like this?”</p>
<p>Her downfall was abrupt. Not long ago, she had taken over control of the fighting arena and pompously declared to bring Orden down.</p>
<p>She really thought back then that she had the whole world at her feet.</p>
<p>She recalled the faces of her executives. She had made so many precious memories with them.</p>
<p>‘Why did you have to get yourselves locked up? You guys should be helping me become the lord of all Djinns….’</p>
<p><em>Tiriring~</em></p>
<p>While lamenting, she received a text message.</p>
<p>[Kirkin released - Lotus]</p>
<p>It was from Black Lotus. She stared at the message for a while before jumping to her feet.</p>
<p>Immediately, the door of the sanctuary opened in slow motion. Wicked widened her eyes as she stared beyond it.</p>
<p>A dear subordinate whom she hadn’t seen for a long time was sobbing there.</p>
<p>“…Kirkin!”</p>
<p>Wicked yelled the name of her executive as she rushed towards him.</p>
<p>“Boss….”</p>
<p>Kirkin greeted his boss with tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>It was a very touching reunion, the kind you could watch without tears.</p>
<p>“Kirkin, how did you escape?!”</p>
<p>“Black Lotus, he helped me,” Kirkin answered with a whimper.</p>
<p>“Black Lotus did? But how?”</p>
<p>“There was this thing called ‘Ranker’s Amnesty’.”</p>
<p>Kirkin explained that Black Lotus spent his ‘Ranker’s Amnesty’—a special privilege given only to the ‘First Ranker’s who helped free Genkelope— to rescue Kirkin.</p>
<p>This story was, of course, something that Horner made up on the spot.</p>
<p>“It's all thanks to Black Lotus….”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness….”</p>
<p>Wicked asked again as she patted Kirkin on the back.</p>
<p>“How are the others?”</p>
<p>“Not good. The prison is filthy, we’re forced to do hard labor, and there’s also the torture….”</p>
<p>At last, Kirkin burst into tears. Wicked comforted Kirkin, holding back her tears.</p>
<p>They already forgot about all the crimes they had committed. Djinns had no shame and no conscience by nature.</p>
<p>“…It’s okay, don’t cry. I- I’ll have another talk with Black Lotus, and I’ll try to get everyone else out, too….”</p>
<p>Such was her tearful resolve.</p>
<p>And so, as the two of them enjoyed their emotional reunion in each other’s arms, Wicked was bound to the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>…Meanwhile.</p>
<p>21F, Card Kingdom.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna buy all of these?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, all of them.”</p>
<p>“You really have that much TP?”</p>
<p>“So what if I do?”</p>
<p>“…Well, I mean-”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin made a clean sweep of all random boxes at the card store. He planned to use his luck to boost his strength…. Suddenly, a number of messages appeared in front of him before he even opened the boxes.</p>
<p>[Your enormous luck has been working behind the scenes.]</p>
<p>[A threatening opponent has turned into a temporary ally.]</p>
<p>[Luck that acts on human relationships is always special!]</p>
<p>[Narrow Escape from Death (5/9) - special stat, ‘accumulation of luck’, has been partially activated!]</p>
<p>Kim Hajin had no idea what these messages meant.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea, An underground bunker somewhere in Gangwondo]</p>
<p>Two weeks had passed since the start of the joint training camp for the ‘National Special Task Force'.</p>
<p>After numerous training sessions, 177 Heroes of the special task force were assigned to 13 different teams. Team 3 leader, Yun Seung-Ah, was teamed up with Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, Shin Jonghak, Yi Jiyoon, Yohei, and Shen Yuan.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to fight Orden head on. I think the administration really trusts you, Suho.”</p>
<p>Team 3 went into mission briefing inside their dormitory.</p>
<p>All 13 teams had different missions. Team 3 was assigned the most difficult task of all: confronting Orden. That said, rumor had it that Aileen’s Team 1 was also assigned the same mission.</p>
<p>“So… Will you be alright?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho answered with confidence as expected of the man who defeated the Demon King.</p>
<p>“You won’t even need to bother. I’ll take care of him.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun interrupted with a smirk. Kim Suho glanced at his friend and shook his head.</p>
<p>“Okay, but first take a look at this blueprint. It’s from ‘Truth Agency’.”</p>
<p>Team Leader Yun Seung-Ah drew everybody’s attention with a huge map.</p>
<p>“Whoa! <em>The</em> Truth Agency?!”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon widened her eyes. Nowadays, the name Truth Agency was basically synonymous with truth itself. It was no longer the small website only a few people knew. Yi Jiyoon clapped her hands in excitement and asked.</p>
<p>“I heard you need a lot of money plus some kind of divine blessing to hear back from them! How much did you spend? No, wait, are you FRIENDS with the Truth Agency?!”</p>
<p>“…I didn’t spend money, the government did. And we’re not really friends. I don’t have enough money to hire Truth Agency.”</p>
<p>“Ah… bleh.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah tried to ignore the last remark.</p>
<p>‘That brat. I only picked her because people said she was a promising supporter, but she’s so rude.’</p>
<p>“…Anyways, it’s time to get back to training. Get ready.”</p>
<p>Their training routine was simple.</p>
<p><em>Clap, clap</em></p>
<p>As soon as Yun Seung-Ah clapped her hands, a sophisticated hologram popped up. The hologram reconstructed the space using Truth Agency’s blueprint as a reference.</p>
<p>“Boss isn’t Orden, but the training area will be similar to the real thing so let’s get used to it.”</p>
<p>This was the work of the ‘Training Simulator’ they had brought back from the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>Their training was to fight against Lv.50 Minotaur at Orden’s Palace.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Pandemonium Arena]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boss was visiting the fighting arena which now belonged to the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>“Please take a seat here, Master.”</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p>Looking down at the stage from the VVIP seat, Boss felt slightly emotional. She also used to be a contestant in the distant past and an audience more recently. But now, the arena was hers….</p>
<p>—Welcome to the Pandemonium Arena! Today’s big match is ‘Big Boon’ vs ‘Rain’!</p>
<p>Big Boon vs Rain.</p>
<p>A fat Djinn and a skinny Djinn entered the stage.</p>
<p>The audience cheered and Boss could feel their excitement on her skin.</p>
<p>—Begin!</p>
<p>The host shouted and the duel began. Big Boon tried to overwhelm Rain with his physique, but Rain quickly dodged and attacked his opponent in small stabs. In short, it was a battle between speed and endurance.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Boss watched the duel with excitement.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, somebody appeared in the VVIP stand.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Her movements lacked ill intentions. Boss turned to face the uninvited guest all the while keeping her composure.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>Boss remembered her as the girl who always accompanied Bell. If she remembered correctly, her name was… ‘Jin Sahyuk’.</p>
<p>“Have you been well?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk smirked. Her voice sounded somewhat arrogant.</p>
<p>Boss looked around as Jain had told her that Bell always chaperoned Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t sense Bell’s presence anywhere near her.</p>
<p>“…Where is Bell?”</p>
<p>“How should I know? I came alone.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shrugged with a smile. Boss glared at Jin Sahyuk. Her gaze was sharp like a blade.</p>
<p>Still, Jin Sahyuk wasn’t intimidated in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Is this our second meeting?”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you again. Where is Bell?”</p>
<p>Boss’ voice was filled with contempt.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Jin Sahyuk smiled leisurely.</p>
<p>“I already know what’s going on between you and Bell, but you don’t have to be so desperate to kill him.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s expression hardened. She continued n a low whisper, “I’ll be the one who kills that bastard.”</p>
<p>—Ah, that was Big Boon’s signature punch! It’s a direct hit!</p>
<p>Big Boon’s punch landed on Rain’s stomach. Rain was pushed all the way to the corner of the stage, and Boss’ body had already become dark. It was her Yasha Transformation.</p>
<p>“Did you come here to get yourself killed?”</p>
<p>Boss got up from her seat.</p>
<p>Both Bell and this woman seemed to possess a unique talent for upsetting her.</p>
<p>“No, I’m here for a different reason. And I’ll lay it out to you right now.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk and Boss stared at each other intensely, a fire burning in their eyes.</p>
<p>With her gaze on Boss, Jin Sahyuk continued, “…If I end up killing Bell,”</p>
<p>—’Big Boon’ is the winner!</p>
<p>A round of applause followed the host’s announcement.</p>
<p>Despite the cheering, Boss could hear Jin Sahyuk’s voice clearly.</p>
<p>“I can take Kim Hajin with me, right? You only dragged him in as a tool to kill Bell.”</p>
<p>It was most definitely a provocation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 275. Vow (3)</p>
<p>The woman’s gaze seemed to be piercing her heart. It was the first time in a while that Jin Sahyuk was up against such formidable hostility. Yet, Jin Sahyuk met her eyes without shaking.</p>
<p>Time flowed in silence.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was a fickle person. She might give up on something in one moment then change her mind in the next. As such, Jin Sahyuk spent a long time thinking about what to do. She decided that she couldn’t give up Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so mad. I’ll use him for a few years and return him.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t sure what his exact ability was, but she knew that there was something special about Kim Hajin’s magic power from what she saw in Akatrina. She could tell because she was especially sensitive to magic power. To reconstruct Akatrina, such power was necessary.</p>
<p>“…I won’t hear any more of this.”</p>
<p>The woman spoke. Hot magic power stemming from rage and killing intent rose up like a tornado. Jin Sahyuk quickly covered herself with a barrier.</p>
<p>“I won’t let you leave here alive either.”</p>
<p>Shadows dyed the woman’s body black. Clear willingness to fight filled the air. Jin Sahyuk genuinely enjoyed this chilling precursor to a heated battle.</p>
<p>“…Do what you want.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had no plans to refuse a fight. Though she wasn’t confident in winning, she didn’t feel like she would lose either. Moreover, Jin Sahyuk wanted to estimate this woman’s strength. This was part of the reason she came to her.</p>
<p>“If you can, that is.”</p>
<p>The moment the woman finished her short speech, shadows rose up from the woman’s feet and enveloped the surrounding area. The woman’s ‘Shadow Barrier’ shut off Jin Sahyuk’s path of escape.</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk smirked and unleashed her magic power. <em>Guooooo…</em> Along with a crimson aura, hundreds of weapons formed in the air.</p>
<p>A battlefield fiercer and deadlier than the Pandemonium Arena appeared. The two women glared at each other before starting the fight to the death.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…Huh? Boss?”</p>
<p>A course voice rang out, pouring cold water on their tense bodies. Boss and Jin Sahyuk both turned to the source of the voice.</p>
<p>“Is my probation over?”</p>
<p>It was Cheok Jungyeong, who was put on probation inside Boss’ Shadow Barrier last week for killing Terror’s Djinns because they picked a fight with him.</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk didn’t seem worried even when Cheok Jungyeong appeared. She believed the woman in front of her wouldn’t be the type to let someone else join a 1:1 fight.</p>
<p>Boss spoke, “…Yes, your probation is over.”</p>
<p>“Ehew~ Thank goodness. Oh right, your barrier is interesting no matter how many times I look at it.”</p>
<p>Boss’ Shadow Barrier didn’t <em>alter</em> the surrounding space but rather <em>summoned</em> beings into it. This was why Jin Sahyuk and Boss met Cheok Jungyeong in this place.</p>
<p>“…Gyeong.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>While Boss and Cheok Jungyeong were talking, Jin Sahyuk loosened her muscles by stretching. However, she didn’t feel relaxed for long.</p>
<p>“Beat her up.”</p>
<p>“Oho?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Sahyuk’s eyes widened. They were surprised for different reasons.</p>
<p>“T-Two against one isn’t fair!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk pointed her fingers at Boss while shouting. But Cheok Jungyeong ignored her. He had been on probation for two weeks, during which he had not fought with anyone. He was currently starved for battle and was overjoyed that a worthy opponent was in front of him.</p>
<p>“Kuhahaha—!”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong charged forward like a wild beast.</p>
<p>“Damn it!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk quickly activated [Reality Manipulation] to try to escape the Shadow Barrier, but Boss and Cheok Jungyeong didn’t let her do as she pleased.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong’s Energy Blast destroyed the circular pathway Jin Sahyuk forcefully created.</p>
<p>“Don’t run away—!”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong shouted happily and shot his fist towards Jin Sahyuk’s face.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Palace]</p>
<p>Excluding Toji, the other three humanoid monsters, Tigris, Xphil, and Doloren, returned to Orden’s palace. They had successfully and valiantly completed Orden’s order to cause havoc in specific countries.</p>
<p>“Ah— I’m bored—”</p>
<p>But Tigris wasn’t content. The other two humanoid monsters felt the same way. They wanted to have more fun killing humans, displaying their overwhelming strength, and bathing in their sense of superiority.</p>
<p>“The palace is boring—”</p>
<p>Orden had ordered their return before they could fulfill even half of their desires. Although they felt annoyed, they had no choice but to follow their king’s command.</p>
<p>“What the hell happened to Toji?”</p>
<p>Doloren murmured as she played with a human head she took as a souvenir. The head belonged to Peindal, a high-rank grade-2 Hero.</p>
<p>“That idiot— I’m sure he fell into a trap— I’m sure he’ll find his way back—”</p>
<p>“Right? Toji won’t die so easily with his tough body.”</p>
<p>“I’m tougher and harder to kill—”</p>
<p>They chatted with each other as they walked towards the king’s court. Standing In front of the large gate before the main court was a praying mantis. It was Kurukuru who had one wing and arm severed.</p>
<p>“…Ew, gross. It irks me every time I see him. Why does he look like that?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I wanted to say—”</p>
<p>Doloren frowned as she stared at Kurukuru. Tigris approached Kurukuru, thinking that he looked grosser up front.</p>
<p>Kurukuru muttered as he glared at them.</p>
<p>“Kururu, kururu….”</p>
<p>“What is he saying— Retard who can’t even talk—”</p>
<p>“Kururururu.”</p>
<p>Doloren translated Kurukuru’s words.</p>
<p>“Why did you come so late? You should have come the moment King gave his command, is what he’s saying.”</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>Tigris sneered.</p>
<p>“A mere praying mantis, you’re not worthy—”</p>
<p>Tigris raised his large hand and slapped Kurukuru.</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>Kurukuru flew to the side and rolled on the floor.</p>
<p>“A weak, lowly praying mantis that can’t even talk—”</p>
<p>Tigris snorted and walked into the royal court. Doloren stared at Kurukuru with a small smile before following Tigris inside.</p>
<p>“…Kururu.”</p>
<p>“Lord Kurukuru!”</p>
<p>Servant-level humanoid monsters helped Kurukuru up. After staggering up, Kurukuru stared at the three humanoid monsters standing in front of his king.</p>
<p>His king was greeting the arrogant monsters who came late with a smile.</p>
<p>“Kurururu….”</p>
<p>Kurukuru clenched his teeth until his jaw swelled.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Gangwondo, Underground Bunker]</p>
<p>The training for the Orden Assassination Mission ended. Inside the simulated Orden’s palace, Team 3 had successfully defeated the Minotaur.</p>
<p>But their teamwork couldn’t be called perfect. Shen Yuan and Yi Jiyoon were killed before they could even reach the boss, ‘Minotaur’, and Kim Suho ended up defeating the boss on his own.</p>
<p>“Why are the normal mobs so strong….”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon sighed and massaged her sore muscles. Meanwhile, Shin Jonghak was staring at Chae Nayun. She was busily writing something down on her notebook.</p>
<p>“Hey, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Hearing Shin Jonghak, both Yi Jiyoon and Kim Suho turned around.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stopped writing, then smirked.</p>
<p>“I’m talking with Master.”</p>
<p>“…Master?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, this notebook works like the Tower’s communication letter.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was using the notebook to communicate with an old man who had become her master before she noticed. Although they usually exchanged chit-chat, there were times when she received valuable advice as well.</p>
<p>“…Oh? Who’s the person on the other side?”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon’s eyebrows danced playfully.</p>
<p>“I told you, it’s my master.”</p>
<p>“Master? Hero Yoo Sihyuk?”</p>
<p>“No, he’s someone hu~ge that you guys don’t know about.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun wondered how they would react if they found out that her master was Heynckes but decided to withhold the information. She shrugged, then put the notebook away.</p>
<p>“Oh right, I have to contact Hajin… Ah.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s next few words made Chae Nayun’s heart sink. Kim Suho, who had murmured to himself subconsciously, paused after realizing what he said.</p>
<p>“…Oh~? What about Kim Hajin~?”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon put on a mysterious smile and skipped over to Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Uh, well… nothing.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho let out a dry cough and gave an evasive answer. He wanted to thank Hajin for all the help he received, but he didn’t have the chance to the last time they met since Yun Seung-Ah was also there.</p>
<p>“Kuhum, anyways…”</p>
<p>He turned to Chae Nayun who was staring at him intently.</p>
<p>“Chae Nayun, don’t let Boss find out about that notebook. She said no electronics, and that’s not that different.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun nodded with a somewhat bad aftertaste.</p>
<p>“What’s not different from electronics?”</p>
<p>It was then that their ‘boss’ appeared.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and the rest of Team 3 froze, and before they could react, Yun Seung-Ah released her magic power to snatch Chae Nayun’s notebook.</p>
<p>“A-Ah! Give it back!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, of course, protested strongly.</p>
<p>“Quiet. Prohibited items will be confiscated on discovery.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah easily suppressed all dissent and began to read the notebook with a grin.</p>
<p>“Let’s see who our Nayun is dating~”</p>
<p>But Yun Seung-Ah’s smile quickly disappeared because of a certain name written in the notebook.</p>
<p><em>Ssk— Ssk—</em></p>
<p>She turned a few pages over before raising her head and murmuring in a daze.</p>
<p>“Heyn… Heynckes? Is this… the Heynckes I know?”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[21F – Card Kingdom]</p>
<p>I used 150,000 TP to pull three 8-star cards and one 9-star card.</p>
<p>Because of the setting that ‘8-star and 9-star cards were limited’, I could only get so much even with my luck. Of course, I wasn’t complaining, especially since they were all effective goods.</p>
<p>“[Anything Checkbook]…”</p>
<p>I walked through the streets as I read the descriptions of the cards I pulled.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Anything Checkbook] [8-star] ＊Effective Good＊</p>
<p>—A checkbook that can pay out anything. The receiver of this check must also carry out what he was paid for.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>First was the 8-star [Anything Checkbook]. Most checkbooks handled ‘money’, but this magical checkbook was different. Not only did this checkbook handle ‘TP’ and ‘magic power’, but it also handled trust and feelings as something that could be valued and given out.</p>
<p>‘What do I use this for…?’</p>
<p>Just as I was pondering…</p>
<p>“Oooooooh~ Who’s this~?”</p>
<p>Someone ran up to me while acting all excited.</p>
<p>“My, if it isn’t our dear master craftsman~”</p>
<p>With a blooming smile, Medea appeared with a nasally voice.</p>
<p>“Great~ Perfect timing~”</p>
<p>Medea acted like our meeting was a complete coincidence, but it didn’t take a genius to figure out that that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>
<p>I looked at Medea with a flustered look. Seeing that she entered the 21st floor with her status as an administrator, it seemed her ‘descent’ into the Phenomenon Realm was happening soon.</p>
<p>“…What do you need?”</p>
<p>“Eh~? No~ It’s not like I need something~”</p>
<p>Medea smiled brightly and handed me a document.</p>
<p>“Here, take this. I was waiting until you came back.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>I glanced at the document.</p>
<p>The words, [Complete Transfer of Prestige], were written across it.</p>
<p>My eyes almost popped out of my eye sockets, but I swallowed hard and calmed myself down.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“I brought it just for you. I don’t need Prestige anymore.”</p>
<p>“…You’re descending?”</p>
<p>“Yep~! Uhuhuhu, uhuhuhu.”</p>
<p>Medea laughed like she had the world under her feet. She even twirled like a ballerina.</p>
<p>“So, to finalize my descent, I was wondering if you could make me a magician’s robe and a ceremonial dress to wear underneath it~”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’ll prepare whatever material you need~”</p>
<p>Medea just looked too happy.</p>
<p>I stared at her and pondered. To make a magician’s robe and ceremonial dress that she would be satisfied with, I would have to dedicate 2~3 hours of my time every day for at least one month.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn’t such a difficult task. Medea could also become a powerful ally to humanity once she descended.</p>
<p>The problem wasn’t time, but what would happen to Earth if she descended.</p>
<p>“You will, right~?”</p>
<p>Medea urged for an answer, and I concluded my thoughts.</p>
<p>“…I can.”</p>
<p>“Woaaaa~”</p>
<p>Medea twirled and giggled like a little kid. Her brain seemed to be missing a screw.</p>
<p>“But I need you to make a vow.”</p>
<p>“I’m coming back alive~ alive~ aliiiiive~”</p>
<p>“…Hello?”</p>
<p>“Yeees~?”</p>
<p>I took out the ‘Covenant Dagger’ that Heynckes left with me. Medea’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Eh, what’s up with the blade?”</p>
<p>“In exchange for the robe and the dress, I want you to make a vow.”</p>
<p>I unleashed spirit power.</p>
<p>“Spirit Power Copier.”</p>
<p>[You activated ‘Miracle – Spirit Power Copier’.]</p>
<p>Yellow aura condensed in front of me and formed the shape of a copy machine.</p>
<p>[Summary – a copier that can copy anything.]</p>
<p>[Activation Condition – reveal the name of the skill.]</p>
<p>[Consumption Value – depends on what is being copied.]</p>
<p>[Effect – copies something with spirit power (To copy a living being, you must put the living being inside the copier.)]</p>
<p>“…What’s that?”</p>
<p>Medea furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing much, so don’t be too worried.”</p>
<p>I put Heynckes’ dagger into the copier.</p>
<p>[Attempting to copy ‘Covenant Dagger’…]</p>
<p>[Problem occurred! You cannot copy this item with your spirit power.]</p>
<p>[Use Stigma Overclocking or set a penalty with Setting Intervention.]</p>
<p>“Setting Intervention.”</p>
<p>“…You’re talking to yourself, you know~”</p>
<p>I added a penalty to the Covenant Dagger.</p>
<p>First, it can only be used on Medea and Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Second, requires 4 streaks of Stigma.</p>
<p>Third, both sides must carry the same weight of the vow.</p>
<p>[Covenant Dagger has been copied imperfectly.]</p>
<p>“Mm, there. We just need to feed it our blood and make a vow.”</p>
<p>Medea’s face returned to what it was in the past. It was the face she had when she was annoyed with me.</p>
<p>“What vow?”</p>
<p>“It’s simple.”</p>
<p>This was necessary to ensure Medea becomes an ally. Without something to tie her down, I didn’t know what she would do once she descended on Earth. With her fickle and curious nature, she might experiment with humans and monsters to operate some kind of a chimera business.</p>
<p>“My vow will be: ‘I will make Medea the most beautiful robe and ceremonial dress.’”</p>
<p>“…Most beautiful~?”</p>
<p>Wariness disappeared from Medea’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, and yours will be, ‘I will not do anything that will harm humanity if I descend.’”</p>
<p>I handed the copied Covenant Dagger to Medea.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, in a dark space of an unknown place.</p>
<p>“…Auu.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk groaned as she rolled on the ground. Her final attempt to escape seemed to have been successful as she couldn’t feel any presences around her.</p>
<p>“Haa… haa… huu.”</p>
<p>She collected her breath and checked her physical condition.</p>
<p>Fractured bones, broken ribs, shattered teeth, and flowing blood…</p>
<p>Her eyes were also damaged, hindering her vision, but thankfully none of her injuries were life-threatening.</p>
<p>“Those cowards….”</p>
<p>She spat out blood and cursed before starting to heal her body. First, she restored her eyes with her Authority, ‘Reality Manipulation’.</p>
<p>As she regained clear vision of her surroundings, a raspy voice entered her ears.</p>
<p>“Coward? You’re an idiot.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a voice she recognized. Jin Sahyuk shot her eyes open and turned towards the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>Jain was smiling brightly and staring at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“…Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Me? You know me. It’s Rain.”</p>
<p>“…Rain?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I guess my face is different from back then. Of course, my real name is a secret.”</p>
<p>‘Who is this woman?’ Jin Sahyuk wondered when she suddenly remembered something. A woman who introduced herself as Rain had visited Bell long ago.</p>
<p>“Do you know how hard it was for me to have you live~? I had to convince her by telling her that you’ll be the perfect bait to drag Bell out of hiding~”</p>
<p>“…What? Bell? Bait?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk forced herself to get up.</p>
<p><em>Crack— Crack—</em></p>
<p>Her broken bones screamed in pain, but it wasn’t unbearable.</p>
<p>“Yep. You have to be alive to bait and kill Bell… Anyways, are you done healing yourself?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk nodded silently. Jain smiled brightly, then quickly moved and twisted Jin Sahyuk’s wrists back.</p>
<p>“What…!”</p>
<p>Then, she placed a [Magic Power Suppressor] on her wrists and ankles.</p>
<p>“You fucker! What are you doing!?”</p>
<p>“Hm~? Oh, I’m just making you into proper bait~ What bait would be allowed to use magic power~?”</p>
<p>“You bitch!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk began to struggle violently, but Jain easily knocked her over by tripping her feet.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk fell face first on the ground. However, she refused to yield and shook her body side to side. She almost looked like a shrimp flopping on dry land.</p>
<p>“Let go of me!”</p>
<p><em>Flop, flop. Splash, splash.</em></p>
<p>“You cowards, 2 on 1 wasn’t enough!?”</p>
<p><em>Flop, flop. Splash, splash.</em></p>
<p>Jain looked down and smiled at Jin Sahyuk who was acting like she actually became a bait. Then, she spoke to Boss who she believed was watching from somewhere.</p>
<p>“Boss, I got a shrimp ready for you.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 276. The Mountain Sage (1)</p>
<p>Tigris, Doloren, Toji, Xphil.</p>
<p>The four monsters that Orden sent out caused a stir around the globe. ‘Orden’s Monsters’ made front-page headlines all over the world. Hopeless news continued to pile up as people watched the despairing report that the monsters destroy their homes and loved ones.</p>
<p>—We’re currently in Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>With the reporter’s words, the TV screen shifted.</p>
<p>Rachel watched the news with graveness in her heart.</p>
<p>—Downtown Shanghai has been destroyed completely.</p>
<p>The word ‘completely’ was spot on. The sidewalks were overturned and the skyscrapers that once touched the sky were reduced to nothing but bare bones and ashes.</p>
<p>—1,300 Heroes were summoned to fight against one monster.</p>
<p>Ceaseless cries of pain resounded over the wreckage of the buildings.</p>
<p>The bodies of the Heroes sprawled out all over the ground were blurred on the screen.</p>
<p>—’Mei Chun’, considered by some to be one of China’s most prospective Heroes; ‘Tulei’, who returned home after graduating from Cube at rank 6; and ‘Li Jufeng’, China’s leading high-rank Hero.</p>
<p>The reporter continued gravely.</p>
<p>—…A total of 987 Heroes, including the three mentioned, fell during their heroic endeavor to protect their country from the monster.</p>
<p>A streak of tears trickled down Rachel’s cheeks.</p>
<p>Despite the diplomatic competition and the petty disagreements she had over the years with China, she grieved from the bottom of her heart. The deaths of the Heroes were a great loss to humanity.</p>
<p>—This is a photo of the monster that caused this devastation.</p>
<p>A full body photo of the monster appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Tigris, a monster that resembled a tiger.</p>
<p>The shape of his body was too human-like for him to be called a two-legged tiger; however, his fur was too thick and his claws were too sharp for him to be considered a human.</p>
<p>—……And Paris is still under attack by ‘zombies’. Zombies kill people, transforming their victims into more zombies. Authorities have not been able to subdue this ‘death-borne transmission’ yet.</p>
<p>If Orden dispatched his monsters as a warning to humanity, his plan was more than successful. The world began to tremble in fear as he intended when it witnessed the cruelty of the monsters.</p>
<p>—But not all countries were defenseless. With the help of Lady ‘Ah Hae-In’, an 8-star magician who happened to be staying in England, and Player ‘Shin Jahyuk’, who served as the Knight Commander of the Royal Knights of Crevon, England successfully stopped a humanoid monster’s attack….</p>
<p>However, if Orden’s goal was to completely destroy the Earth, then he had clearly failed. Not only did England successfully stop the monster, but it also immobilized it as well.</p>
<p>—Although England’s defensive tactics have proved to be successful, it appears the ‘World of Wish’ will continue to remain popular among its citizens. Experts attribute the growth of popularity to the widespread rumor that says ‘the World of Wish will remain intact even when Earth shatters to pieces’.</p>
<p>“…Princess?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Rachel’s old butler returned to the room.</p>
<p>Rachel brushed away her tears.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“You should come on out. The guests will be arriving soon.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, is it really that time?”</p>
<p>The heads of different countries were scheduled to visit England today. Not only the Prime Minister and the rest of the cabinet but Rachel was also expected to greet them.</p>
<p>Rachel got up in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Evandel, take some rest.”</p>
<p>Before she left, Rachel patted Evandel who had fallen asleep on the couch.</p>
<p>“…Uuuee.”</p>
<p>Evandel gave a small nod with her eyes barely open.</p>
<p>‘She must be tired from taking care of all the wounded summoned spirits yesterday,’ Rachel thought as she kissed Evandel gently on the forehead. Then she left.</p>
<p>It only took about 10 minutes from Buckingham Palace to Toji’s jail by limousine. A number of magicians were charging the jail cell that Knight Commander Shin Jahyuk had specifically built for Toji with their magic power.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming, Princess.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see you.”</p>
<p>Rachel smiled and exchanged greetings with the Defense Secretary. Other ministers seemed busy preparing to welcome the VIPs. Rachel studied their faces.</p>
<p>"Cut down all the trees around here."</p>
<p>"But I heard that the Immortal loves nature."</p>
<p>"Really? Uh… Then get some more trees from somewhere."</p>
<p>Chae Joochul was coming to observe Toji. In addition, Yoo Yeonha, who was currently in demand by virtually all authoritative figures in the world, was also coming to visit.</p>
<p>The citizens of England had high hopes for this meeting, yet the Prime Minister who should be leading this meeting from the front was currently talking on the phone in a corner.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, so you arrived at Busan safely? Yeah, sure. I’ll take care of the permanent residency, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke Korean even during personal calls.</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, yeah. I’ll be right with you. There’s not much time left until my term ends anyway….”</p>
<p>Rachel’s eyebrows wriggled to form a frown.</p>
<p>That man had secretly evacuated his entire family to Korea. How could he put his family before the entire country that he was responsible for?</p>
<p>Rachel was baffled.</p>
<p><em>Koong—</em></p>
<p>Just as she was about to approach the Prime Minister, a portal activated with a huge tremor. Essential Dynamics called it the ‘portable portal’, which was not exactly a suitable description considering the device weighed 3 tons. But it was the only device that could help people travel to a specific destination without the use of a ‘Gift’ or ‘Skill’.</p>
<p>“Everyone get ready! They’re coming through!”</p>
<p>The technician shouted and the cabinet gathered near the portal. Rachel stood next to the Prime Minister as well.</p>
<p><em>Jiing….</em></p>
<p>Soon, the portal activated with an azure glow, and they could see a man and a woman on the other side. The first person to arrive was Chae Joochul, followed by Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Welcome!”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister approached the two guests.</p>
<p>“I’m Ray McKean. It’s an honor to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul shook hands with the Prime Minister. Rachel quickly stepped to the Prime Minister’s side.</p>
<p>“I’m Rachel Elizabeth Louise. It’s an honor to finally speak to the Immortal."</p>
<p>Rachel held out her hand, but Chae Joochul only stared at her with a mysterious look in his eyes.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>‘Should I withdraw my hand, or should I keep it still?’ Rachel wondered when Chae Joochul finally spoke.</p>
<p>“…You seem to possess a Gift that is similar to mine.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Rachel tilted her head in confusion. However, a moment later, when she realized that Chae Joochul had just praised her, she could hardly breathe.</p>
<p>“P-P-Pardon?”</p>
<p>A Gift similar to Chae Joochul’s. The Immortal had just announced that he and Rachel were alike.</p>
<p>‘Does that mean he’s been watching me all this time?’ Rachel was overcome with joy and pressure at the same time.</p>
<p>“Oh, r-really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Of course, Chae Joochul meant it in a completely different way. Similar Gifts meant similar side-effects.</p>
<p>He continued to stare at Rachel to see how she would react….</p>
<p>“Ah, t-thank, thank you.”</p>
<p>‘Just as expected, Heroes of the new generation are oblivious to side-effects,’ thinking so, Chae Joochul passed Rachel without a handshake.</p>
<p>“Good to see you.”</p>
<p>A woman came up and grabbed Rachel’s trembling hand.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, Yeonha-ssi. It’s good to see you, too.”</p>
<p>It was Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled and cut to the chase.</p>
<p>“Could you show me ‘Toji’?”</p>
<p>“…Of course. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Rachel tried to soothe her pounding heart as she led Yoo Yeonha and Chae Joochul to the Toji Jail.</p>
<p>Not that it was necessary, because the blue cubic jail was clearly visible from miles away.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked up at the cube somewhat admiringly and said, “That’s the jail? I’m surprised it’s holding up.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but the magicians have to inject their magic power to maintain it.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s ‘Reality Manipulation’ had one limitation. To maintain itself, the product needed a steady supply of magic power. But that also meant that the jail could be maintained forever so long as there was a continual delivery of magic power.</p>
<p>“Is the monster sleeping?” Chae Joochul asked as he studied Toji inside the cube.</p>
<p>“Yes, he has been for a while,” answered Rachel, at which Chae Joochul approached the cube and <em>tok tok</em>— knocked on it.</p>
<p>“…What are you-”</p>
<p>Startled, Rachel sort of lunged at Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>But the Immortal appeared calm. He asked, “How do I get inside?”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Inside?”</p>
<p>Toji’s defense was impregnable. Rachel and Ah Hae-In had already reached the consensus that the best way to deal with Toji was to imprison him for as long as possible. And Chae Joochul had already been informed of their decision.</p>
<p>Still, Chae Joochul seemed slightly confused by Rachel’s reaction as he said, “I have to get inside. Or else I won’t be able to kill that monster.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>…Of course, Chae Joochul, the strongest man of the present era, was full of confidence.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Central Asia, Pandemonium]</p>
<p>The residents of the presidential suite of Pandemonium’s most extravagant hotel, ‘Sauron’s Respite’, were having a peaceful afternoon despite all the commotion that was happening in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>In a room set to the perfect temperature, laced with tranquil classical music and beautiful scenery just outside the window…</p>
<p>“Bell! Sahyuk was taken!”</p>
<p>Rumi finally shouted, unable to contain her frustration any longer.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I heard you,” Bell answered flatly as he lay on the couch.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you going to save her?”</p>
<p>Bell responded to Rumi with a smile.</p>
<p>“No. Why would I when I was the one who sent her there?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“I sent her there.”</p>
<p>He instigated her to go, to be exact. He had to work his way up to it because she was the type of person who would never agree to do anything if she wasn’t convinced it was her idea.</p>
<p>‘You won’t be able to change anything even if you go.’</p>
<p>‘You shouldn’t go; you’ll only end up getting beaten.’</p>
<p>‘If you win against Byul, I’ll do anything you say.’</p>
<p>Bell provoked Jin Sahyuk and she fell for it.</p>
<p>A part of his original plan was to introduce her to the Chameleon Troupe, but he also wanted to bring her down a peg or two. She’d been too arrogant for his taste recently.</p>
<p>“A-Are you insane?! Who knows what they’ll do to her?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. They’re gonna leave her alone. …Haam~”</p>
<p>Bell gave a big yawn. Rumi glared at him in aghast.</p>
<p>“How can you be so sure?”</p>
<p>“They’re not a group of thugs, especially now that Byul is the boss and Kim Hajin controls them.”</p>
<p>A director- that word suited Kim Hajin quite well. The way Bell saw it, Boss depended on Kim Hajin and wouldn’t do anything to upset him.</p>
<p>“Just let her be. Sahyuk is the type to grow stronger by overcoming obstacles anyway.”</p>
<p>And if by any chance Jin Sahyuk happened to be in danger for real, Bell would simply need to save her before she ended up dead. She was as resilient as a cockroach anyways.</p>
<p>“…What are you gonna do about Orden then?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Orden?”</p>
<p>Recently, the name ‘Orden’ had become synonymous with fear.</p>
<p>But apparently not to Bell.</p>
<p>Bell only smiled and said, “I don’t know. I’m not too worried about him.”</p>
<p>“…Why not?”</p>
<p>Looking up at the ceiling from the couch, Bell muttered, “He admires humans too much to eradicate them.”</p>
<p>For someone to destroy humanity in its entirety, he had to truly loathe humans— and Orden didn’t.</p>
<p>Bell knew this all too well.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Palace]</p>
<p>“You have to eat. No, no snacks. You have to eat real food.”</p>
<p>Monster King Orden was looking at a child. The name of this child was Yeonhee and she was three years old. Currently, she was playing with two dolls, speaking to them in a play of her own, “Your name is Cindy and your name is Yeonjoo. Wow! Yeonjoo, you’re a good eater!”</p>
<p>Suddenly Orden began to wonder where this child came from. She was originally born of two humans but died from illness, and Orden had reconstructed her body and soul afterward.</p>
<p>Then who exactly were her parents?</p>
<p>“Cindy! You should learn from Yeonjoo!”</p>
<p>Orden continued to watch Yeonhee play with the dolls. The girl placed the two dolls in front of her and beamed.</p>
<p>Orden thought, ‘Are all human children like this, or is there something wrong with this one?…’</p>
<p>“Nom, nom.”</p>
<p>It was definitely disrespectful of her to play with dolls in the presence of the king. If any of his servants had done this, Orden would have disintegrated them immediately. But Orden wasn’t angry. Rather, he was overcome with a strange desire to watch the girl forever.</p>
<p>“T-This is where you were.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Park Hanho showed up.</p>
<p>He rushed to his daughter and held her in his arms.</p>
<p>“I sincerely apologize. My child is still young and foolish….”</p>
<p>Park Hanho bowed his head and apologized.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Orden stared at Yeonhee in Park Hanho’s arms. She was trying to wriggle out of her father’s arms to pick up the dolls lying on the floor. Orden stretched strands of his magic power out towards the dolls and delivered them to the girl.</p>
<p>He spoke “…I see her wander around here and there. Are children supposed to be like that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, most young children are naturally curious.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Orden turned his gaze to the child again. Yeonhee was smiling at Orden, grateful that he had returned her dolls to her.</p>
<p>“Well then, we’ll leave now.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho lowered his head. Yeonhee did the same.</p>
<p>"Good morning.”</p>
<p>But it was the wrong greeting.</p>
<p>Orden unconsciously let out a smile.</p>
<p>"No, Yeonhee. You have to say 'goodbye’.”</p>
<p>"Oh. Goodbye. Cindy and Yeonjoo says goodbye, too."</p>
<p>Yeonhee tilted the dolls forward. Orden stared at Yeonhee in silence.</p>
<p>At that moment, Park Hanho turned around, and Orden watched the two leave the room.</p>
<p>‘…She’s cute.’</p>
<p>Orden surprised himself by thinking so.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Pandemonium, a shady alley]</p>
<p>I left the Tower of Wish, or technically, the World of Wish.</p>
<p>The sun was starting to set as I walked through an alley in Pandemonium, looking over the list of requests I had received. Some of these requests were addressed to the Truth Agency, some to the Jeronimo Mercenaries, and the rest to the Chameleon Troupe. I attributed my overflowing mailbox to the ‘Four Monsters of Hell’.</p>
<p>“…There’s so many.”</p>
<p>The Truth Agency was flooded with Orden-related questions. I answered whatever question I could answer with the Book of Truth, and I chose to decline most of the requests addressed to Fenrir asking me to exterminate the monsters. I then kept walking….</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, my body floated into the air. I didn’t realize that I had fallen until my body flipped upside down.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Aether protected me from the impact, but the next attack was even quicker than Aether.</p>
<p>There appeared to be multiple assassins. One sliced the Aether shield open, the other pushed a dagger through the gap, and yet another cut into my Achilles tendon.</p>
<p>I felt burning pains in my shoulder and ankle.</p>
<p>It seemed that the dagger was coated with poison.</p>
<p><em>Thud—</em></p>
<p>I fell to the ground. All of this happened in less than a second.</p>
<p>I tried to activate Bullet Time but my Gift didn’t respond. Only then did I realize why I wasn’t able to detect the ambush in the first place.</p>
<p>‘A Gift that nullifies other Gifts.’</p>
<p>One of the settings that I ended up discarding included a description about a group of assassins. One of its members, the Mountain Sage, possessed the nullification Gift. But I wasn’t sure why he was here in Pandemonium when he should be working in the Middle East.</p>
<p>‘…Too bad assassination doesn’t work on me.’</p>
<p>His Gift had nullified my Gift but I still had my Skills.</p>
<p>I activated my unique skill, Time Reversal before the blade reached my throat.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 277. The Mountain Sage (2)</p>
<p>The ‘Mountain Sage’ rose from the Middle East as the successor of the legendary assassin ‘Hassan-i Sabbah’. Their roots date back to the year 1990, when the world had entered a period of rest after overcoming Outcall. It all started from a young Iranian youth who awakened the Gift [Shackles].</p>
<p>This Gift had a simple power – to restrain.</p>
<p>On a smaller scale, it could restrain humans. On a bigger scale, this powerful Gift could restrain even space and the flow of time.</p>
<p>As if this wasn’t enough, the Iranian youth awakened a second Gift, [Void World].</p>
<p>After a thousand years, the successor of the Order of Assassins had returned.</p>
<p>The youth changed his name to ‘Hazen’ and officially inherited the Sabbah.</p>
<p>Using his past title, Lord of Alamut, he called himself the Mountain Sage and accepted only his direct descendants into the assassin group.</p>
<p>Just like that, Hazen began to secretly work in the Middle East. To calm the chaotic political scene, he killed militant leaders by disguising it as accidents and used the chaos that ensued to assassinate the Djinns and humans who were the root of it all.</p>
<p>He continued his mission for 30 years.</p>
<p>They had acted so secretly that even Kim Sukho had only recently discovered them. Although Kim Sukho had stepped down from the position of President, his desire for power had never subsided. In his head, the Mountain Sage’s Order of Assassins was the perfect tool to deal with the Chameleon Troupe. Although its founder, Hazen, was already dead, he had left behind a powerful legacy. Kim Sukho liked their meticulous assassinations and their sole desire for gold.</p>
<p>As such, Kim Sukho called on them to become the mastermind in the shadows. He eliminated those who opposed him by disguising the murders as accidents and dug into politicians who seemed fishy to find their weak points. Through this, he formed a powerful stronghold that was much more powerful than when he was a president.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho believed it wouldn’t be any different this time. Although he had some doubts, the results shown by Hazen’s descendants gave him confidence.</p>
<p>Not long after accepting his request, Hazen’s descendants figured out Black Lotus’ identity through a simple yet difficult method of tracking all of Black Lotus’ whereabouts. It was the work of their third executive who possessed the Gift [Colossal Search].</p>
<p>Just like that, the ‘Kim Hajin Assassination Plan’ started and was almost successful.</p>
<p>No, it already succeeded once.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin is Fenrir, and Fenrir is Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>In a thick darkness, the first of Hazen’s five descendants, ‘Hassun’, spoke.</p>
<p>They were hiding inside the darkness while waiting for Kim Hajin to show up.</p>
<p>“Interesting.”</p>
<p>The youngest descendant, Hayre, smiled. It was surprising given his usual cold, emotionless attitude.</p>
<p>“We don’t have to report this to our client?”</p>
<p>“Our mission is to assassinate Black Lotus. Further talk is unnecessary. Is he coming soon, Hazehre?”</p>
<p>Hassun asked the third descendant, Hazehre.</p>
<p>“Yes, Kim Hajin will appear here.”</p>
<p>With an incredible inference and calculation ability, [Colossal Search] could even predict the future location of its target. Hazehre had already done his work and learned that Kim Hajin would appear near them soon.</p>
<p>“…He’s coming.”</p>
<p>The five descendants in hiding all sensed a presence.</p>
<p>They flared up the Gift they all shared, [Void World]. Their bodies turned transparent, camouflaging them based on their surroundings, and darkness slowly spread out. Inside this dark domain, enemies were incapable of activating their Gifts.</p>
<p>Just like their past targets, Black Lotus would also be assassinated…</p>
<p>“…Come out.”</p>
<p>However, the target’s voice rang out before they could do anything. The five assassins flinched slightly.</p>
<p>But they didn’t think they were discovered.</p>
<p>They believed Black Lotus was randomly murmuring as one would when coming back to a dark, empty home.</p>
<p>“Otherwise, I’ll go instead.”</p>
<p>In the next moment, the target revealed himself.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>The five assassins all tilted their heads. The target, Kim Hajin, was emitting some kind of an aura.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin called the spirit power he awakened the Author’s Spirit Power. The best part was that it could materialize the setting he wanted at any time.</p>
<p>As such, Kim Hajin created a setting with his spirit power. [Catch Field] – a skill that could track the presence of anyone within 500 meters.</p>
<p>In addition, he sent his will to Spartan and called for a trustworthy reinforcement.</p>
<p><em>KOONG—!</em></p>
<p>Next to Kim Hajin, an eagle and a burly man appeared.</p>
<p>It was then that Hazen’s descendants realized something was wrong.</p>
<p>The burly man, Cheok Jungyeong, spoke.</p>
<p>“What is it all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Look over there.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin pointed at the direction Hazen’s descendants were hiding. At the same time, Kim Hajin’s aura shot out and lit up the area.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong furrowed his brows and followed Kim Hajin’s finger.</p>
<p>“…Should we run?”</p>
<p>Hayre murmured.</p>
<p>“No, it’s already too late.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A husky voice rang out behind them. It was Cheok Jungyeong’s voice, and the next sequence of events happened lightning fast.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—! Thud—! Boom—!</em></p>
<p>The sound of combat rang out.</p>
<p>Although the five descendants did their best to resist, assassins were naturally no good in a direct fight. Cheok Jungyeong, who specialized in direct combat, was an unbeatable existence.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England, London]</p>
<p>It was early morning in Central Asia but dinner time in England. Near Buckingham Palace, a rowdy event was underway.</p>
<p><em>Booom—!</em></p>
<p>Lightning shot up from the prison cell Jin Sahyuk created. When the lightning disappeared, a flaming whirlpool appeared along with winds that were sharper than blades. The magnitude of the phenomenon easily surpassed what could be found in nature.</p>
<p><em>Kooong—!</em></p>
<p>The series of disasters shook the prison cell Toji was trapped in. Hundreds of magicians poured in their magic power to maintain the cell. Still, dozens of magicians were knocked out in ten seconds as Chae Joochul ceaselessly shook the prison cell.</p>
<p>—Uaaaaaah….</p>
<p>Toji’s scream rang out.</p>
<p>His skin melted from extreme heat but still maintained its form and was cut from the metal-attribute wind, yet nothing could sever his body.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul poured powerful attacks into the prison cell from the outside. The injured Toji screamed in pain.</p>
<p>But that only lasted a moment. After a round of attacks finished, Toji’s body regenerated as though nothing had happened. Then, he fell asleep peacefully.</p>
<p>“…He truly is an interesting one.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul stopped his attacks and murmured apathetically.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap.</em></p>
<p>The magicians who were supplying magic power to the prison cell fainted one by one.</p>
<p>“Amazing. I feel like I’m in a dream.”</p>
<p>“A-As expected of the Immortal….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha and England’s Prime Minister couldn’t hide their awe, while Rachel stood by with her mouth wide open.</p>
<p>Heaven-destroying natural disasters had just occurred inside a tiny, 30-square-meter cell. The Immortal’s power was even more awe-inspiring in person.</p>
<p>“External attacks seem to work, but it looks like indirect attacks from the outside aren’t enough to bring him down.”</p>
<p>“That was indirect…?”</p>
<p>Rachel swallowed her saliva at Chae Joochul’s casual words.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t he have at least suffered mental damage?”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister asked carefully.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul knew that Toji had forgotten pain. Not even ‘imagined pain’ created from fear, which was far scarier than actual pain, existed in that monster’s mind.</p>
<p>“No. Besides that, where is the person who created this prison?”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul took interest in another matter. Although an external supply of magic power was needed, he had not seen an ability that could endure his power in a long time.</p>
<p>Rachel stepped up and explained, “It was created by a Player. She is gone now.”</p>
<p>“Gone? So she died?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Rachel thought Chae Joochul was joking. It was then that Rachel met Chae Joochul’s emotionless eyes. From the deep void in his eyes, Rachel felt a chill run down her back.</p>
<p>She squeezed out an answer.</p>
<p>“No, she, she went back to the Tower….”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul then turned away.</p>
<p>“Unless you want to release him from the prison, it looks like someone else will need to handle him. We will need someone who can stop him from regenerating.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul stepped back with dignity. His words, ‘someone who can stop him from regenerating’, made everyone think of one Hero.</p>
<p>The Sword Saint, Kim Suho.</p>
<p>The man who achieved the greatest title for a swordsman while only being in his mid-twenties.</p>
<p>Knowing that Rachel was acquainted with him, England’s Prime Minister gave her a heartfelt look. It was then.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to call any brats, Old Man.”</p>
<p>A deep voice suddenly rang out.</p>
<p>He sounded like Chae Joochul, but his voice felt deeper and more sonorous.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul revealed a hint of surprise as he turned to face the voice.</p>
<p>The government officials surrounding the area quickly parted when they met Chae Joochul’s gaze. Like Moses who split the Red Sea, the owner of the voice quickly revealed himself through the gap.</p>
<p>Dark blue eyes, long braided white hair, a scar on his eye, and wide shoulders with a shabby steel sword by his waist.</p>
<p>The man who appeared… was a legend everyone knew well.</p>
<p>It was an opponent Chae Joochul had not met in a long time.</p>
<p>“But I’m a bit tired from traveling….”</p>
<p>The man gave a profound smile.</p>
<p>Realizing who he was, Yoo Yeonha’s jaw dropped. The man in front of her was truly a legend.</p>
<p>“So I’ll personally deal with him tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>‘Dresden’s Miracle’, where one man slaughtered ten thousand monsters; ‘Operation Krahan’, where a large Djinn group disappeared overnight… He was the legendary Hero behind numerous tales. Among the Nine Stars, he was known to be second only to Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>‘Steel Spirit’ Heynckes had appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha couldn’t maintain a straight face because of the shock.</p>
<p>“Heynckes.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul called his name just as apathetically as before. Chae Joochul knew of the side-effect of Heynckes’ Gift, so he only gave him a dry look.</p>
<p>“Will you be able to do it?”</p>
<p>Heynckes answered easily, “…As an artifact of the past, it’s time for me to help the new generation.”</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, there was nothing special about Chae Joochul and Heynckes’ meeting as they both kept a set distance and only stared at each other.</p>
<p>But everyone else maintained silence as they stared at the two titans. To them, they felt like they were experiencing an important moment in history.</p>
<p>But no one dared to take out a camera to take photos. They simply stared at this once in a lifetime moment in a daze.</p>
<p>“…It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>Only one person managed to muster up enough courage to speak. It was a woman who came as Chae Joochul’s acquaintance.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Lord Heynckes.”</p>
<p>She was the sole exception.</p>
<p>“My name is Yoo Yeonha, the Chief Strategic Officer of Essence of the Strait.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Inside Buckingham Palace]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha came to stay overnight in Buckingham Palace. It was, of course, due to Heynckes. To plan for their meeting the next day, Yoo Yeonha began to study German, German history, Heynckes’ life, and more. She fully employed Falling Blossom’s power to look for topics to talk about.</p>
<p>—Tok, tok.</p>
<p>While Yoo Yeonha was hard at work, knocking sounds rang out.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>The door opened as soon as Yoo Yeonha gave the permission. As she expected, Rachel carefully walked in. She put down a tray of red tea and dessert on the table.</p>
<p>“…Ah, thank you. I was feeling a bit tired.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled brightly. Rachel also smiled back and sat across from her. The two women leisurely enjoyed the sudden tea time.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha sipped on red tea while looking over documents. Rachel watched Yoo Yeonha work for thirty minutes or so before finally working up the courage to speak.</p>
<p>“Yeonha-ssi, this is about the guild alliance Essence of the Strait brought up.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked up at Rachel without speaking.</p>
<p>Rachel became a bit nervous, but she was determined.</p>
<p>If the English Royal Court could form an alliance with Essence of the Strait, then the huge unrest the people of England were feeling would subside greatly. Even the Prime Minister who was trying to escape to Korea could change his mind.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if you would like to team up with our guild… We will do our best to meet any demands.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha didn’t say anything, so Rachel quickly continued.</p>
<p>“We discovered several artifacts from the Middle Ages recently. If our guilds ally, they can be lent out to Essence of the Strait’s members… Ah, and Essence of the Strait can also use rights and interest we possess in Prestige….”</p>
<p>Rachel’s carefulness and Yoo Yeonha’s leisure began to lead to a negotiation. It was then.</p>
<p><em>Thud—!</em></p>
<p>The door suddenly shot open.</p>
<p>Rachel and Yoo Yeonha turned to the door without much thought.</p>
<p>“Haam… You were here?”</p>
<p>Standing there was Evandel, with her eyes half-closed.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Startled, Rachel jumped up from her seat. Yoo Yeonha’s eyes also shot open.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had good memory.</p>
<p>But even if her memory was bad, she would have remembered that kid. She was that cute, like a fairy who came out of a story.</p>
<p>“…Wait.”</p>
<p>But the last time Yoo Yeonha had seen her, the child was with Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>Rachel quickly ran towards the door and picked Evandel up.</p>
<p>“…Wait, wait, who’s that?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked, but Rachel hid Evandel from sight with her back and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“What? What do you mean, nothing? Who is she?”</p>
<p>“Nothing!”</p>
<p>Rachel didn’t have the confidence to explain Evandel to Yoo Yeonha. In the end, she quickly ran off.</p>
<p>“Where are you going!?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shot up and began to chase Rachel.</p>
<p>“Tell me who that is! Hold on a minute, I think I’ve seen her before in Seoul…!”</p>
<p><em>Tadadadat—</em> Yoo Yeonha shouted as she ran across the hallway.</p>
<p>“Like I said, it’s nothing….”</p>
<p><em>Tadadadat—</em> Rachel ran, almost in tears.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha knew that she couldn’t catch up to Rachel no matter how hard she ran, so she utilized the tools she had in her arsenal.</p>
<p>“If you don’t come back, there will be no alliance! I was going to do it, but not if you run away…!”</p>
<p>Even so, Rachel didn’t stop running away. In fact, she used the power of her elementals to quickly disappear from Yoo Yeonha’s sight.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa.”</p>
<p>Left in an empty hallway, Yoo Yeonha looked around her surroundings in a daze.</p>
<p>Rachel and the mysterious child were gone completely. Yoo Yeonha wiped the sweat that formed on her forehead.</p>
<p>“What the heck….”</p>
<p>She was left with many questions and doubts.</p>
<p>That day, bizarre chaos emerged in Yoo Yeonha’s head.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I returned to the Chameleon Troupe’s hideout with Cheok Jungyeong and five prisoners.</p>
<p><em>Koong!</em></p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong threw the unconscious assassins on the floor.</p>
<p>“Why did you bring them back?”</p>
<p>A family of assassins, two in their thirties and three in their twenties.</p>
<p>I wanted to interrogate them since people I only knew about through my setting appeared in person.</p>
<p>But Cheok Jungyeong replied with a grin.</p>
<p>“To use for my training.”</p>
<p>“…Training?”</p>
<p>Though a bit stupid, it was a very Cheok Jungyeong-like answer.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe’s hideout was built with magic engineering, so the exit was removable. Naturally, it was possible to lock someone up.</p>
<p>“Will you be fine?”</p>
<p>Cheok jungyeong grinned and smacked his chest.</p>
<p>“Of course! I’ve been bored, so it’s perfect. There’s Orden, but there’s time until I’ll get to fight him!”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong granted the title, ‘powerful enemy’, to Orden.</p>
<p>But we had yet to even set a date for our battle. We only knew that a ‘spy’ who infiltrated his palace would let us know of a good time.</p>
<p>“These guys have a gift for making critical attacks. So I can use them to train how to avoid critical attacks.”</p>
<p>“Um… sure. But make sure to find out who’s behind them.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, don’t worry about that. Oh right, Boss imprisoned someone recently. Her name’s Jin Sahyuk. You know her, right?”</p>
<p>My eyes shot open. Jin Sahyuk?</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk and Boss? What happened?”</p>
<p>“Who knows? Boss said she’ll use the kid to lure in Bell. Mmmm~”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong stretched.</p>
<p>I pondered.</p>
<p>Bell and Jin Sahyuk, Boss and Bell, and Boss and Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what happened, but there was one thing I was sure of.</p>
<p>Given Bell’s personality (though I didn’t know much about him), it didn’t seem like he’d come save Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>After a light sigh, I asked Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“Where is she imprisoned?”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I came down to the lowest floor of Chameleon Troupe’s building. Rather than a prison, it was more like an undeveloped floor.</p>
<p>In this empty space, Jin Sahyuk was curled up like a shrimp with her hands and ankles restrained with magic power suppressors.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She looked feeble, like she hadn’t eaten food or drank water in days. She even had an blindfold on to hinder her vision.</p>
<p>What idiotic thing did she do this time to get herself in this situation?</p>
<p>Looking at her, I suddenly felt sympathy. It was a side-effect I developed after finding out about Kim Chundong’s past. Kim Chundong and Jin Sahyuk formed most of my recent worries.</p>
<p>“Tsk…”</p>
<p>Rather than that, why was someone with the highest potential in my novel getting thrashed around all the time?</p>
<p>“…Who is it!?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk seemed to have heard me click my tongue as she gave a reaction. She raised her head to look at me, but she sighed after realizing the blindfold was still covering her vision.</p>
<p>“I-Is it Bell?”</p>
<p>Bell? Did she lose her intuition too after being locked up?</p>
<p>I approached her with a wry smile. Then, I put my hands on her blindfold.</p>
<p>“Uk.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk trembled. But she seemed to have figured out my intent as she didn’t resist.</p>
<p>“Whew… It’s Bell, right?”</p>
<p>She let out a sigh of relief as I carefully lifted the blindfold.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 278. Commence (1)</p>
<p>I cautiously removed Jin Sahyuk’s blindfold. With the cloth blocking her sight gone, Jin Sahyuk slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She frowned, blinded by the light, then she raised her head and looked at me.</p>
<p>“…You’re not Bell.”</p>
<p>She tilted her head, still in a daze. She sat motionless for the next three minutes.</p>
<p>I was the one who spoke first. With a sigh, I asked, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t answer and only dropped her gaze to the floor. Her cheeks were slightly flushed from embarrassment.</p>
<p>“If you aren’t going to talk, I’m leaving.”</p>
<p>As I got up, Jin Sahyuk flinched. She bounced up desperately like a fish jumping out of water.</p>
<p>“Wait! Don’t leave!”</p>
<p>I stopped and looked down at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“…Release me.”</p>
<p>I scanned Jin Sahyuk carefully.</p>
<p>She was bound with ‘Magic Power Suppressors’, a powerful effective good from the Tower of Wish that suppressed all magic power.</p>
<p>“How did you get caught in the first place?”</p>
<p>“I….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk opened her mouth as if she was about to say something but soon shook her head with a sigh.</p>
<p>“…I can’t tell you.”</p>
<p>“Then I can’t let you go either.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s resentful glare landed on me.</p>
<p>Our fruitless conversation continued, when suddenly….</p>
<p>“She said she wanted to borrow you.”</p>
<p>I heard a new voice behind my back. It was Boss.</p>
<p>I turned around, slightly confused.</p>
<p>“Borrow me?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Boss scowled at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk averted her gaze without a word.</p>
<p>It wasn’t too difficult to discern what had gone down between these two.</p>
<p>‘Jin Sahyuk thinks I’m Kim Chundong so she probably told Boss that she wants to take me to Akatrina, which led them to have a fight. Although, I’m not sure why Jin Sahyuk chose to announce her decision to Boss….’</p>
<p>“Hajin, she’s dangerous. She’s planning to kidnap you,” Boss said as she furtively stepped on Jin Sahyuk’s foot.</p>
<p>“Kuaak—” Jin Sahyuk screamed, but she didn’t forget to bite Boss’ shoe at the same time.</p>
<p>“As you can see, she’s vicious. You can’t set her free.”</p>
<p>Boss stared at me with a mysterious look. This time I could understand the meaning behind her gaze even without the help from the Magnifying Glass. She was worried for me.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I scratched the back of my neck awkwardly. Of course, I had no intention of returning to Akatrina with Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>However, I was destined to leave Boss one day.</p>
<p>Technically, I didn’t even exist in this world.</p>
<p>A bittersweet taste lingered in my mouth.</p>
<p>“Well, even if I do end up getting kidnapped, it sure isn’t going to be by her. You don’t have to worry-”</p>
<p>“You still can’t set her free. I have to go now because I have other business to take care of, but if this scoundrel isn’t here when I come back,” Boss looked at me sternly, “Bear in mind there won’t be any forgiveness even if it’s you.”</p>
<p>Boss warned coldly and left immediately.</p>
<p>‘Well, nothing I can do at this point.’</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk also raised her head and looked at me.</p>
<p>She whispered, “Just let me go secretly.”</p>
<p>“Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned.</p>
<p>“…At least give me something to eat.”</p>
<p>“Eat?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m starving.”</p>
<p>Right, since her magic power was sealed, it should be harder for her to withstand hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>“Fine. Give me a moment.”</p>
<p>I went upstairs to the kitchen. Cooking was easy thank to Dwarf’s Dexterity.</p>
<p>In 20 minutes, I finished cooking a pot of beef porridge and prepared jangjorim and kimchi as side dishes.</p>
<p><em>Sniff, sniff—</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was already enjoying the smell of the dish before I came down the stairs.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>I put the tray down in front of her. But Jin Sahyuk only stared at it without laying a finger on it.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Untie me so that I can eat.”</p>
<p>“You know I can’t.”</p>
<p>“…What, so you expect me to lick it like a dog?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glared at me. As a former king, she wouldn’t dare endure such disgrace.</p>
<p>Left with no other option, I scooped the porridge with a spoon and offered it to her.</p>
<p>“Open wide.”</p>
<p>“…Fuck.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk seemed to have realized that this was the best treatment she was goign to get as she swallowed the porridge without resistance.</p>
<p>However, the moment that the porridge slid down Jin Sahyuk’s throat….</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>I let out a laughter as I had expected her to react this way.</p>
<p>Even the most expensive ingredients wouldn’t be able to recreate the amazing taste of my porridge.</p>
<p>The dish was the manifestation of perfection that only [Young Dwarf’s Dexterity] could create.</p>
<p>“It’s good, right?”</p>
<p>“I-It’s…. Give me more. I need to taste it thoroughly for an honest assessment.”</p>
<p>With a smile, I stuffed the porridge down Jin Sahyuk’s throat.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk soon lost all sense of shame.</p>
<p>“Give me that kimchi.”</p>
<p>“Jangjorim too.”</p>
<p>“Give me one more bowl.”</p>
<p>“More.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t you have any dongchimi?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk ate like she had been starving for eons.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, around the same time, Rachel had evacuated to her room with Evandel.</p>
<p>Although her heart was still thumping from the earlier incident, she was relieved to see that Evandel had already fallen asleep in her arms.</p>
<p>“Phew….”</p>
<p>Rachel let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>She was sure Evandel was asleep when she left.</p>
<p>‘Did she wake up because I wasn’t by her side?’</p>
<p>A sense of pride swept through Rachel when she realized that, maybe, she had become important to Evandel. But it was quickly replaced by concern as she remembered what Kim Hajin and Ah Hae-In said to her.</p>
<p>They both had insisted to keep Evandel hidden from others for as long as they could. This was the reason why all royal servants had to swear under the ‘silent oath’.</p>
<p>Of course, Rachel could always argue that Evandel was her cousin or something…. But everything happened so fast and she didn’t want to lie to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was dangerous because she could do anything for the honor and glory of her guild. Rachel didn’t want to expose Evandel to such an ambitionist.</p>
<p>But for some reason, it seemed that Yoo Yeonha already knew Evandel. Rachel couldn’t stop thinking about what Yoo Yeonha said about seeing Evandel in Seoul.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Rachel carefully placed Evandel on the bed.</p>
<p><em>Zzzz— Zzzz—</em></p>
<p>Now in a more comfortable posture, Evandel fell deeper into sleep. She seemed as lovely as always.</p>
<p>Putting aside all worries and concerns, Rachel lay beside Evandel and patted her.</p>
<p>“…Guild alliance.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s words suddenly popped up in her mind, but Rachel managed to block it.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to use Evandel as a means for negotiation. Evandel was dear to her.</p>
<p>Rachel patted Evandel’s head until her breathing began to soften.</p>
<p>And soon enough, Rachel began to feel sleepy as well.</p>
<p>“…Haam.”</p>
<p>Rachel’s eyes closed and her hands stopped.</p>
<p>…The pair fell into a deep seep.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the victim(?), Yoo Yeonha, was unable to sleep.</p>
<p>“What was that?…”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha muttered as she twirled a pen between her fingers.</p>
<p>She had returned to her room after failing to locate Rachel.</p>
<p>The girl who came looking for Rachel earlier was most definitely the girl who was with Kim Hajin. So the most probable explanation at this point was….</p>
<p>“But that girl clearly doesn’t have Kim Hajin’s genes. She only looks like Rachel.”</p>
<p>“What is….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha wrapped her head with her hands.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but suspect that this all had something to do with Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Thinking back now, Kim Hajin always wanted to help Rachel out in one way or another.</p>
<p>For example, the negotiation between Essential Dynamics and the British government months earlier was fundamentally the fruit of Kim Hajin’s efforts.</p>
<p>Then were Kim Hajin and Rachel really… Wait.</p>
<p>Then what about Chae Nayun?</p>
<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Was Kim Hajin a womanizer who chased after girls at every chance he got?</p>
<p>‘No,’ She thought, ‘He may be a sociopath without empathy but he’s definitely not a player.’</p>
<p>Maybe it was a momentary mistake?</p>
<p>That made more sense. Anything could happen between a man and a woman on the spur of the moment.</p>
<p>“…Oh my god.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha covered her hot, flushed cheeks with her hands.</p>
<p>“Oooh.”</p>
<p>‘So that means….’</p>
<p>The girl seemed to be about five years old at the least.</p>
<p>Which meant it must have happened when they were still in Cube….</p>
<p>“Oh god, I can’t believe him….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha started to feel a sense of betrayal as her imagination intensified.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The next morning.</p>
<p>Rachel slowly opened her eyes. Evandel was already gone, probably having left for her morning meditation session with Ah Hae-In.</p>
<p>“Haam….”</p>
<p>Rachel stretched with a yawn.</p>
<p>—Tok, tok.</p>
<p>This knock was probably from her butler.</p>
<p>“I’m awake,” Rachel answered, and the old butler opened the door and came into her room.</p>
<p>“Were you able to get a full night's rest?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And Evandel is…?”</p>
<p>“Lady Ah Hae-In picked her up this morning for their morning meditation. Would you like a cup of tea?”</p>
<p>Rachel nodded and pulled herself out of bed.</p>
<p>“Yes, black tea, please.”</p>
<p>As soon as the butler clapped his hands, servants brought her the tea. Rachel combed her disheveled hair and sat at the table.</p>
<p>“Enjoy your tea.”</p>
<p>The butler left, and Rachel poured the tea out of the teapot into the cup in front of her.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to fight off her remaining drowsiness and begin yet another beautiful day with a sip of bittersweet tea-</p>
<p>—Excuse me, you can’t do this.</p>
<p>A small commotion occurred just outside her room.</p>
<p>—Stop!</p>
<p>—This place is off-limits to outsiders!</p>
<p>‘What’s happening?’</p>
<p>Curious, Rachel turned her head towards the hallway.</p>
<p>—What do you mean by off-limits? I’m the princess’ teacher and I need to speak to her right this moment!</p>
<p>It was then that she recognized the familiar voice.</p>
<p>Rachel flinched. Immediately, the door swung open and a woman entered the room.</p>
<p>“Ah~ I knew you’d be here, Rachel.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Rachel’s grip around the cup tightened the moment she saw the woman.</p>
<p>“How have you been?”</p>
<p>This woman was Rachel’s former teacher, the elementalist ‘Shin Yeohwa’.</p>
<p>Rachel suddenly felt dizzy.</p>
<p>All those horrible days she had spent with Shin Yeohwa unexpectedly emerged in her mind.</p>
<p>She had been beat up, insulted and humiliated for no good reason.</p>
<p>Rachel wanted to erase that portion of her past from her memory forever.</p>
<p>“Why haven’t you been keeping in touch? Do you know how much I missed you?”</p>
<p>However, despite the horrendous treatment she had received from her former teacher, Rachel chose not to take any action against Shin Yeohwa. It wasn’t just because she was afraid of Shin Yeohwa’s reputation as the Earth’s best elementalist. Rachel didn’t want to betray her teacher.</p>
<p>“Why won’t you answer me?”</p>
<p>Shin Yeohwa, oblivious to her former student’s generosity, took advantage of Rachel’s publicity and promoted herself as ‘Rachel’s Master’.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know better than to ignore your teacher?”</p>
<p>Shin Yeohwa gave a sly smile.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Gangwondo, Underground Bunker]</p>
<p>Three weeks had passed since the start of the training camp.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stayed awake all night again because of the memo Heynckes had left behind the day before.</p>
<p>—Oh, by the way, I met Kim Hajin last week. He seemed to be a feisty lad.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun couldn’t find the right words to answer him. She no longer remembered what she was supposed to feel about Kim Hajin. The only thing that she was sure about at this point was that she wanted to see him badly.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun spent the night in distress and morning came before she knew.</p>
<p><em>Tiriring-</em></p>
<p>Everyone got out of bed at the sound of alarm and stood in a line at the center of the bunker.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>Soon enough, Team Leader Yun Seung-Ah appeared.</p>
<p>This time she was accompanied by a rather unusual guest.</p>
<p>Spirit Speech Master Aileen.</p>
<p>With a stern look and a pair of short legs, Aileen stood beside Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah looked down at Aileen with a mixture of emotions.</p>
<p>She let out a small sigh and began her speech, “So… today is the day that we begin our mission… Miss Aileen will explain the details.”</p>
<p>Surprised murmurs filled the bunker as no one had expected the mission to begin so abruptly.</p>
<p>Aileen explained, “My Team 1 and your Team 3 will enter Orden’s territory today. We’ve been keeping the exact date hidden for confidentiality, and I hope you understand.”</p>
<p>It was an astonishing and sudden declaration.</p>
<p>“But there’s no need to worry. Our first and foremost goal is to build an outpost. We’re simply setting up a place for us to eat, sleep, and rest while we fight Orden.”</p>
<p>Aileen took out a card from her pocket.</p>
<p>“This is a 7-star card called [Building Fortress].”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Building Fortress] [7-star] <em>Effective Good</em></p>
<p>-  Instantly build a fortress: above the sea, beneath the earth, over a cliff, anywhere.</p>
<p>-  The fortress possesses Lv.7 Defense and is equipped with a ‘portal’ that only the card owner’s allies can use.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“This card can be used to build a fortress anywhere. We’ll use it to build our underground outpost near Orden’s palace.”</p>
<p>Aileen stopped and laid out on the ground the various camping gears that had been reduced in size with magic engineering.</p>
<p>“All of you, take one each.”</p>
<p>Though they were still stunned by the sudden announcement, the Heroes quickly retrieved the gears from the ground just as they had been instructed to do.</p>
<p>“And now, I introduce you to the man who will help us travel to Orden’s territory.”</p>
<p>A dense fog rolled over the bunker the moment Aileen finished speaking. A man in a robe appeared from within the fog.</p>
<p>“…Nice to meet you. My name is ‘Rebé’.”</p>
<p>The man who introduced himself as ‘Rebé’—’Bell’—smiled at the Heroes. To Bell, the members of the Task Force were basically gold mines, destined to become leaders of the future.</p>
<p>“Is he an outsider?” Kim Suho asked, slightly suspicious.</p>
<p>Aileen answered briefly, “…Yes, he is.”</p>
<p>To be honest, Aileen was also suspicious of this outsider. She had hesitantly agreed to let him in on the mission only because the administration insisted that he was trustworthy.</p>
<p>“Ah, please, do not be worried. I am already under ‘Spirit Speech Seal’, as well as ‘Oath and Vow’.”</p>
<p>It was true. Not only did Bell sign all sorts of contracts, but he also agreed to be put under Aileen’s ‘Spirit Speech Seal’, which proved that Bell’s intentions were pure. He didn’t need to lie about Orden because his goals aligned with the government’s.</p>
<p>“Unni, Spirit Speech Seal is that thing where….”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Aileen nodded to Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>“Even if this man has the intention of betraying us, it’s okay. His heart would burst and he’ll die a painful death with just one word from my mouth.”</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. This meant that Bell had basically entrusted his life to Aileen.</p>
<p>“Well, in that case…”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded and stepped back.</p>
<p>“Thank you everyone, for trusting me.”</p>
<p>Bell spoke, trying keep his voice modulation in control.</p>
<p>“My role in this mission is very simple. I’m going to transport all of you to Orden’s territory using my Skill, ‘Mass Teleport’…. Well, I guess I shouldn’t waste any more of your time. Everyone, please gather around me.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Yi Jiyoon, Yi Yeonghan and the remaining members of Team 3 hesitantly approached Bell.</p>
<p>“Please hold onto each other tightly so that you don’t end up outside the spell circle. Ah, but don’t look so nervous. You’ll be returning here as soon as you finish setting up the outpost.”</p>
<p>Bell released his magic power. Violet air currents swirled around Bell, creating a complicated geometric shape.</p>
<p>Bell shouted cheerfully, “Here we go~”</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>Before long, the spell circle was completed and Bell’s Skill, ‘Mass Teleport’, was activated.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 279. Commence (2)</p>
<p>[Mass Teleport] brought the members of Team 3 to Orden’s territory. But when they opened their eyes, they didn’t see anyone from Team 1, including Aileen.</p>
<p>Only the members of Team 3 were on the vast field of Africa.</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>Team 3’s leader, Yun Seung-Ah, became a bit worried when a second flash of Mass Teleport occurred.</p>
<p><em>Shoooong….</em></p>
<p>A violet magic power lit up, transferring over others.</p>
<p>Aileen, Yi Yongha, Jin Seyeon, Nicholas, Parma, and Seo Youngji. Although Team 1 consisted of only these six Heroes, everyone other than Seo Youngji and Jin Seyeon were elites of the Temple of Justice.</p>
<p>Everyone from Team 3 except Shin Jonghak stared at them with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“Is everyone here?”</p>
<p>Aileen stepped up and checked the Heroes present. But for some reason, Aileen had an eyepatch over her left eye. This [Smart Eyepatch] was an effective good from the Tower, allowing complicated calculations and deductions to be made with ease.</p>
<p>“…Mm, great. Everyone’s here.”</p>
<p>After receiving the result from the eyepatch, Aileen smiled in satisfaction. Rebé approached Aileen and spoke in a soft voice.</p>
<p>“My role ends here but… if you would like, I can tag along.”</p>
<p>Aileen furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“What help will you be to us?”</p>
<p>“I can carry your bags, for example. I’ve already made a vow, so you can order me around as you please. Think of me as your sla—”</p>
<p>“Hold on a minute.”</p>
<p>Aileen took out a radio. From what the Hero Association discovered, Orden had the ability to detect magic power within 500km of his palace. But because his detection ability was limited only to magic power, the higher-ups decided to use electronic equipment.</p>
<p>“This is Aileen, we’ve arrived safely.”</p>
<p>—We can hear you. This is Commander Yi Gongmyung.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung. His intelligence and strategic mind rivaled the level of a Gift, he became the Minister of National Defense at just 30 years old.</p>
<p>“What should we do next?”</p>
<p>—We deployed a drone and dug a tunnel. It should be nearby, so please confirm it.</p>
<p>“A tunnel?”</p>
<p>Aileen looked around.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was an entrance covered in leaves and rocks.</p>
<p>“I found it.”</p>
<p>—Go inside. Orden and his servants’ magic power detection becomes weak underground. But for everyone’s safety, don’t use magic power until I give the signal.</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Aileen turned around and faced the others.</p>
<p>“Follow me, everyone!”</p>
<p>Team 1 and Team 3 began their march, everyone following behind Aileen.</p>
<p>The tunnel dug by the drone was dark and deep.</p>
<p><em>Click—</em></p>
<p>Aileen turned on a flashlight and lit the pathway.</p>
<p>“…Hey, Kim Suho, what’s this?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun tapped on Kim Suho’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but we’ve been expecting something like this, right?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho smirked and answered. Chae Nayun also put on a thin smile.</p>
<p>“I guess so. I don’t mind. It’s fun.”</p>
<p>“Same.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie.”</p>
<p>“I’m not.”</p>
<p><em>Tak, tak-</em> Only the sound of footsteps rang out.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak cut in between Chae Nayun and Kim Suho, and Chae Nayun walked while playing a mini-game on her phone.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, Shin Jonghak, and Kim Suho walked forward side-by-side.</p>
<p>The tunnel ran down diagonally until it became flat at a certain point.</p>
<p>“How have you guys been?”</p>
<p>As the tension was starting to die down, a voice suddenly rang out.</p>
<p>Kim Suho turned around in slight surprise and saw Jin Seyeon who was smiling brightly.</p>
<p>“Ah, Senior.”</p>
<p>“I-It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“…Hello.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, and Shin Jonghak answered respectively.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see you all.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon, who felt uncomfortable in Team 1’s stiff atmosphere, liked being with her juniors more. She first tried to estimate Kim Suho’s strength. She didn’t need to fight him, only needing to look into his eyes. As expected of the man who recently gained the title ‘Swordsman of Wish’, Kim Suho had gotten strong enough to make Jin Seyeon smile.</p>
<p>“Um, Senior, who’s that?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho pointed at ‘Bera’ and asked.</p>
<p>“Mmm—“</p>
<p>“Think of me as a hidden powerhouse.”</p>
<p>Bera answered before Jin Seyeon could say anything. Clearly, Bera had excellent hearing.</p>
<p>“…A hidden powerhouse?”</p>
<p>Seeing Chae Nayun frown, Bera grinned.</p>
<p>“Yes, there are many hidden powerhouses in this world. Heynckes who appeared once again and Black Lotus, for example. Ah, Orden would also be considered one.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s eyes slightly widened.</p>
<p>“You know Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>“Mm… Maybe I’m Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s impossible.”</p>
<p>Aileen, who was listening in on the conversation, spoke firmly.</p>
<p>“Black Lotus isn’t so frivolous.”</p>
<p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Aileen’s sharp tone turned the atmosphere awkward.</p>
<p><em>Tzzzt— Tzzt—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Aileen’s radio turned on.</p>
<p>—If you haven’t been discovered yet, everything is going as planned. Walk 200km from there. You can use buff magic if you want.</p>
<p>“200km…”</p>
<p>Aileen turned around. Yi Jiyoon and Parma were the group’s supporters, but because Parma was a healer, buffing the team was Yi Jiyoon’s job.</p>
<p>“Supporter Yi Jiyoon, prepare [Haste].”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon carefully took out a bow. Then, she weaved ‘buff arrows’ with her magic power.</p>
<p>“One for each.”</p>
<p>“…Can’t you do it using a spell or something?”</p>
<p>Aileen, who didn’t even like syringes, wasn’t happy to be pierced by arrows.</p>
<p>“It’s more effective this way.”</p>
<p>“…Tsk. Go easy.”</p>
<p>Aileen closed her eyes reluctantly, and Yi Jiyoon shot her arrows. Although being shot came with a slight pain, it was more than bearable.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>With Yi Jiyoon’s ‘Haste’ buff, the group moved quickly enough to leave behind afterimages. Although 200km couldn’t be traveled easily by walking, their superhuman physical abilities heightened with Haste let them accomplish it in 3 hours.</p>
<p>—This is Yi Gongmyung. If everyone has arrived at the destination, use the card.</p>
<p>They arrived at a spacious area. Rather than a pathway, it was more like a room.</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>Aileen took out the fortress card as ordered.</p>
<p>“We will be using it now.”</p>
<p>7-star card, [Building Fortress]. Aileen infused her magic power into it without hesitation.</p>
<p>“I want a tough fortress capable of holding 300 people.”</p>
<p><em>Shoong—</em></p>
<p>The moment Aileen’s Spirit Speech was added to the card, the card turned into magic power and seeped into the earth.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>There was no rumbling or further undulation of magic power. Only a faint wind blew before space began to warp.</p>
<p>Tough iron fencing rose up from the ground, while dozens of small barracks appeared inside. A headquarters building was constructed in the middle.</p>
<p>“Wow… it’s a real fortress.”</p>
<p>“Amazing.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Chae Nayun murmured in awe. But they weren’t the only ones who were surprised. Even Aileen who activated the card stared at the fortress in shock.</p>
<p>“A-Alright, let’s go inside and unpack. This will be our base of operation for the upcoming Orden Assassination Mission.”</p>
<p>Aileen announced proudly as she walked into the fortress.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The fortress had 99 barracks. Considering the number of Heroes that would need to use the base, three people had to share one. As such, Chae Nayun, Yi Jiyoon, and Jin Seyeon came to use the same barracks.</p>
<p>Inside the petite log cabin, the three women unpacked their belongings leisurely.</p>
<p>“Hm? Nayun-ssi?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Jin Seyeon called Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, who was changing her clothes, tilted her head.</p>
<p>“You dropped this… what is it?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon picked up a piece of paper that fell on the ground. It was wrinkly from being kept in her pocket all this time.</p>
<p>“Oh, that?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun smiled bitterly as she received the [Invitation Letter to the Loveroom].</p>
<p>“It’s an effective good that can summon a person.”</p>
<p>“…Summon?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I just need to know the person’s Tower nickname.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yi Jiyoon cut in.</p>
<p>“Wow, really? Who are you going to summon with that?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, I have someone in mind.”</p>
<p>Extra 7. Chae Nayun immediately thought of her game master, who saved her when she was about to die inside the Tower. Although a couple years had passed since she obtained the summoning item, she didn’t have the chance to use it.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll use it soon.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun planned to use it before fighting Orden. After all, it would be wasted if she died.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jin Seyeon looked at the summoning paper with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s a great item. I’d love to have one too. Ah, do you want to exchange it with this card?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon took out a card.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[A Thousand-day Wait] [6-star]</p>
<p>—Can be used 1000 days after acquiring it. After this card is activated, you will meet someone you want coincidentally the next day.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Chae Nayun read the item description then quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>“Nah, I have to wait a thousand days to use it. That’s terrible.”</p>
<p>“No, no, think about it. It’s better since you don’t need to know your target’s Player name.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I already know who I’m going to summon.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun pushed the card away. Jin Seyeon pouted then put the card back into her pocket.</p>
<p>“Who are you going to summon? Can you tell us his Player name? Let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon narrowed her eyes at Chae Nayun. Yi Jiyoon also stared at her with eyes full of anticipation.</p>
<p>Of course, Yi Jiyoon already knew who Chae Nayun wanted to summon. It had to be Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“Technically, I don’t know who he is either… Ah, you might know, Senior, since you’re a gosu.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun cleared her throat then carefully brought up a name.</p>
<p>“Extra 7… Have you heard of him?”</p>
<p>“Mm… He does sound familiar….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon furrowed her brows and fell into thought. Chae Nayun focused her attention on Jin Seyeon, hoping for an answer. After all, Jin Seyeon was a famous Ranker inside the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>Neither Jin Seyeon nor Chae Nayun paid any attention to Yi Jiyoon.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon found the answer easily. She had a huge hint.</p>
<p>The nickname ‘Extra 7’ and what Kim Hajin secretly said to her when he came to cure Chae Nayun’s curse.</p>
<p>—Tell her that an extra came to help.</p>
<p>“…<em>Gulp.</em>”</p>
<p>The question that was lingering in her mind ever since that day was finally answered.</p>
<p>‘So that’s what he meant by extra…’ Yi Jiyoon swallowed hard.</p>
<p>“Haha, sorry, I’m not sure. I’ll try to find out later.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon scratched her head and laughed.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s fine. He likes to keep his identity a secret, so it’s not all that surprising.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun waved her hands.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon stared at them with a wry smile before heading out of the barracks.</p>
<p>—Ah, why don’t you summon him now?</p>
<p>—Eh? Ah~ no, that’s a bit… haha, I want to, but we’re in the middle of a top-secret mission.</p>
<p>—I’m kidding, of course. But what are you going to say to him when you meet him?</p>
<p>—Nothing much. I just have a few questions to ask him, but more importantly, I want to thank him. He saved my life, you see.</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon went to find Shin Jonghak, leaving behind Chae Nayun and Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England, Buckingham Palace]</p>
<p>As the sun was rising from the east, many spectators were already gathered around the ‘Illusory Prison’ entrapping Toji.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, Vice-Minister, their secretaries, Princess Rachel, Yoo Yeonha, etc… Everyone except Chae Joochul and Heynckes were present, waiting for Heynckes who declared he would kill Toji.</p>
<p>“Hey, who was that kid from yesterday? Why won’t you answer me?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nudged Rachel who was standing next to her. But Rachel maintained a thick face and replied shamelessly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“…What do you mean? Is that all you have to say? You’re joking, right?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Rachel’s innocent face dumbfounded Yoo Yeonha even more.</p>
<p>“Wow, look at you. Did you lose your memory?”</p>
<p>In truth, Rachel wasn’t in any state to deal with Yoo Yeonha. She already had a headache from ‘Shin Yeohwa’ who made her nest in her bedroom.</p>
<p>“Um… I’m not sure what you mean….”</p>
<p>“Excuse me! Don’t you want to form an alliance?!”</p>
<p>“Aa! Lord Heynckes is coming out!”</p>
<p>Rachel quickly pointed to the distance.</p>
<p><em>Tak, tak—</em></p>
<p>Like she said, Heynckes was approaching the crowd.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha decided to put her suspicion aside and ran up to Heynckes.</p>
<p>“Lord Heynckes, I’m Yoo Yeonha. I introduced myself to you yesterday. How are you feeling today?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke in German. Heynckes seemed happy as his eyebrows danced furtively.</p>
<p>“You’re Yoo Jinwoong’s daughter. I’m fine. Your German is excellent.”</p>
<p>“Haha, yes, I enjoy German culture.”</p>
<p>“Oh, do you now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, German beer is the best in the world.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm~”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha showed off the German skills she acquired through her crash course last night. Heynckes talked to her in satisfaction as he walked towards the Illusory Prison.</p>
<p>“It’s time for business. We can talk later.”</p>
<p>Heynckes stopped their conversation.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
<p>Satisfied with the result she got, Yoo Yeonha backed off.</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack—</em></p>
<p>Heynckes loosened his neck and shoulder muscles.</p>
<p>“Now… let’s do this.”</p>
<p>“Lord Heynckes, we have a buff magician ready.”</p>
<p>“That’s unnecessary.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister quickly suggested the use of a buff magician, but Heynckes declined and took out his steel sword.</p>
<p>He had already finished his preparations. Although his body was no longer what it used to be, he honed himself last night, and his resonance with his steel sword was clear.</p>
<p>That was enough for him.</p>
<p><em>Chwiik—</em></p>
<p>Hyenckes swung his sword, unleashing his magic power at the same time.</p>
<p>The Illusory Prison shattered. The steel magic power spread out in all directions and formed a new prison, one that encased Hyenckes and Toji inside.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Toji, who was asleep, woke up with a dazed look. He noticed that his surroundings had changed.</p>
<p>“Wha…”</p>
<p>Toji got up, feeling curious. Heynckes swung his sword, piercing Toji’s chest.</p>
<p>“Ak.”</p>
<p>Toji screamed and stepped backwards. He frowned and glared at Heynckes. Pain angered Toji.</p>
<p>“You, kill.”</p>
<p>Rocks crumbled from Toji’s body, which then shot towards Heynckes. But mere rocks couldn’t touch Heynckes. In terms of compatibility, Heynckes’ ‘steel’ displayed absolute superiority against Toji’s ‘earth’.</p>
<p>“You! Kill!”</p>
<p>Seeing that long-ranged attacks were ineffective, Toji began to swing his fists.</p>
<p><em>Koong—! Koong—! Koong—!</em></p>
<p>But Hyenckes easily avoided Toji’s inexperienced attacks and countered at the right time. Wounds began to appear on Toji’s body.</p>
<p>“I, no pain.”</p>
<p>Even so, Toji stood unperturbed. He had long forgotten about pain. He believed his body could regenerate itself endlessly, and thus had no fear.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Toji soon realized that his body wasn’t moving as he wanted it to.</p>
<p>His arms felt heavy, and his chest stuffy.</p>
<p>It was as if the soil making up his body was hardening.</p>
<p>Toji had no choice but to stop attacking.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Dull little rascal, you just realized?”</p>
<p>Heynckes grinned.</p>
<p>“Real…ize?”</p>
<p>“Steel Transformation. That’s what you’re experiencing. I injected my magic power into your mind.”</p>
<p>Toji’s body was made of earth, and metal defeated earth. It wasn’t hard for Heynckes to inject his magic power into Toji’s body.”</p>
<p>“You also caught the symptoms killing my body.”</p>
<p>The magic power of steel devoured Toji’s body of earth, and steel transformation quickly took place.</p>
<p>“This….”</p>
<p>Toji could no longer move. He stared at his body, which was solidifying and becoming metallic.</p>
<p>“…What an anticlimactic end.”</p>
<p>Heynckes felt Toji’s final moments were no different than his own. He knew he would meet the same end one day.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to see it any longer.”</p>
<p>Heynckes raised his sword. Like a wind-up doll that stopped functioning, Toji stood still with his head facing down.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>After a sigh, Heynckes’ steel sword swung down.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Africa – Orden’s Territory]</p>
<p>Late afternoon of early winter, in the African continent filled with monsters, I arrived in Orden’s territory along with Spartan.</p>
<p>“Black Lotus. I just arrived.”</p>
<p>It was to accomplish the secret mission assigned by the Hero Association to the Chameleon Troupe – ‘Spy Retrieval’.</p>
<p>—Yes, confirmed.</p>
<p>The commander of the mission, Yi Gongmyung, answered from the radio.</p>
<p>He was a character I created, a genius in tactical warfare and strategy, so I had confidence in his abilities.</p>
<p>—I’ll send the signal to the spy soon.</p>
<p>I didn’t know how, but he managed to plant a spy in Orden’s territory. The Chameleon Troupe was tasked with retrieving him safely. The reward was, as expected, an astronomical amount of money and the cancelation of the bounty placed on them.</p>
<p>There was no reason not to accept.</p>
<p>“What comes after the signal?”</p>
<p>—You can go to the fortress we prepared underground.</p>
<p>“…Fortress?”</p>
<p>Underground fortress. The unexpected phrase surprised me.</p>
<p>—Yes, we prepared a fortress to use as our base camp. It was prepared in secret, so I’m afraid I can’t tell you too much about it.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Well, nothing was really impossible in this world. I wouldn’t be surprised if Atlantis existed too.</p>
<p>“Understood. Contact me after signaling your spy.”</p>
<p>—Yes, understood.</p>
<p>As soon as the communication cut off, a beeping signal arrived.</p>
<p>It was a Morse code signaling a coordinate.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 280. Commence (3)</p>
<p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
<p>Orden Spy Retrieval Mission. The Association needed the strongest and the stealthiest member of the Chameleon Troupe for this mission they named ‘Sunrise’. Boss was the most suitable member, of course, but the reason I volunteered in her place was simple.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just because I could turn back time and Boss couldn’t.</p>
<p>I was worried about her.</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to see her get hurt.</p>
<p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
<p>Boss must have thought the same thing. Before I came here, we had a little argument over who would participate in this mission.</p>
<p>I won in the end, but… Boss was probably watching me from somewhere right now.</p>
<p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
<p>I took out the [Mysterious Magnifying Glass] again, which allowed me to identify other people’s emotions and weaknesses. Boss’ emotions that I witnessed the other day continued to linger in my mind.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>I heaved a sigh.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered that it had been 8 years since I first woke up in this world.</p>
<p>That’s enough time to graduate from both middle and high school.</p>
<p>More than half of those years, I spent with Boss.</p>
<p><em>Beep— Beep—</em></p>
<p>Over the years, through all the laughter we shared, she changed me and I changed her. She had become close to me before I knew it.</p>
<p>“…Yi Byul.”</p>
<p>I muttered her name.</p>
<p>It was then that I realized this could be an interesting pun.</p>
<p>‘Yi Byul (Separation) had become close to me before I knew it.’</p>
<p><em>Beep— Beep.</em></p>
<p>My thoughts were starting to get off topic when the Morse code finally stopped.</p>
<p>I ceased thinking and turned my attention to the screen which displayed a pair of numbers.</p>
<p>[7.273853, 20.141379]</p>
<p>Converted to latitude and longitude, the result was: [7º16’25.9”N 20º08’29.0”E].</p>
<p>These coordinates, according to the map… was in the middle of Orden’s palace.</p>
<p>“…What the.”</p>
<p>The coordinates were pointing to the center of Orden’s palace.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, this mission wouldn’t have come with such great rewards if it was easy.</p>
<p>I picked up the radio and whispered, “I received the coordinates.”</p>
<p>—Roger that. Contact us after rescuing our agent. Also, please wear the camera we gave you. After we confirm that our agent is safe, we’ll let you know the location of the underground fortress.</p>
<p>The radio stopped there, and I took out the [Book of Truth] to make sure all of this wasn’t a trap.</p>
<p>My question: ‘Is this mission a facade for capturing the Chameleon Troupe?’</p>
<p>The answer: ‘No.’</p>
<p>“That was a waste.”</p>
<p>Though it sounded simple, the question actually took up two streaks of Stigma, because it required an understanding of human psychology and its structure. Fortunately, thanks to the Orb of Regeneration, it would take only three hours to fully recharge Stigma.</p>
<p>“Mmm~”</p>
<p>I stretched before I began the mission.</p>
<p>I put on some armor and other equipment I brought with me.</p>
<p>First was the carbon fiber armor reinforced with magic, rare ores, and enchantment — the [Black Lotus Uniform].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Black Lotus Uniform] [Masterpiece] [Composite Attribute]</p>
<p>A masterpiece born of great dexterity. When you look at this armor, you can’t help but admire the craftsmanship of the Dwarves, the ‘creation race’.</p>
<p>「Defensive power — 7/10」</p>
<p>「High-rank Shock Absorption」</p>
<p>「High-rank Magic Power Circulation」</p>
<p>「High-rank Physical Strength Enhancement」</p>
<p>「High-rank Magic Power Reinforcement」</p>
<p>「Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even though this uniform weighed as light as a t-shirt, it had the sturdiness of a military tank. In addition, I granted it four ‘high-rank’ and one ‘pinnacle-grade’ enchants through Four-colored Enchant.</p>
<p>I put extra effort into the last option, 「Pinnacle-grade Instant Acceleration」.</p>
<p>“I’ll try it out today.”</p>
<p>A while ago, Boss severed one of Kurukuru’s wings. I ground it into powder and used it as material for Four-colored Enchant. As a result, I was able to reproduce Kurukuru’s speed, though only for a moment.</p>
<p>After the great [Black Lotus Uniform] was the [Black Lotus Robe], which was meant to be worn over the uniform.</p>
<p>My creativity was at its limit, so I ended up naming all my equipment after ‘Black Lotus’.</p>
<p>Somehow their names made them feel more luxurious.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Black Lotus Robe] [Luxury] [Multiple Attributes]</p>
<p>A masterpiece born of great dexterity. When you look at this robe, you can’t help but admire the craftsmanship of the Dwarves, the ‘creation race’.</p>
<p>「Defensive power — 5/10」</p>
<p>「High-rank Shock Absorption」</p>
<p>「High-rank Concealment ∙ Stealth」</p>
<p>「High-rank Anti-Magic Force」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Not only did the robe come with a stealth function, but it was also equipped with an ‘anti-magic power’ function, making me immune to almost all petty spells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I also brought the [Black Lotus Walker], which increased my speed, and the [Black Lotus Wrist Protector], which increased the power of my arrows.</p>
<p>Click— Click—</p>
<p>I was now dressed from head to toe in the complete set of ‘Black Lotus attire’.</p>
<p>Lastly, I put the invisibility cloak over Spartan who was sitting on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?”</p>
<p>—Pururu.</p>
<p>Now fully grown, Spartan was as big as the length of my forearm.</p>
<p>“Let’s go rescue that agent.”</p>
<p>—Pururu.</p>
<p>Spartan was already aware of the coordinates. He closed his eyes and started shaking.</p>
<p>Soon, Spartan’s Authority ‘Long-ranged Teleportation’, which allowed for instant travel over a long distance, activated.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes again, I was in front of Orden’s palace.</p>
<p>“Okay, Spartan, you should head back now.”</p>
<p>—Pururu?</p>
<p>Spartan shook his head, but this place was too dangerous for him. One hit in the wrong spot and he could die.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to risk losing Spartan, so I forcefully sent him away.</p>
<p>After I made sure Spartan left— I turned on the camera I received from the Association, which was hanging at the end of a necklace around my neck.</p>
<p>“This is Black Lotus. I turned the camera on. Can you see?”</p>
<p>—Yes. Thank you for your cooperation. Please capture the palace as much as possible….</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Aileen created an island of her own inside the commander’s tent of the underground fortress. She built walls with boxes of snacks from all around the world and placed cute stuffed animals here and there for decoration.</p>
<p>“Mm~ Mmm~”</p>
<p>The combination of snacks, a penguin plush, and a shark plush was indeed beautiful.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you guys the cutest~?”</p>
<p>Some people might criticize Aileen for being so laid-back during a serious mission, but this was how she always was.</p>
<p>Aileen never had the chance to experience real fear because she had been incredibly powerful since she was a child. She was always first place, revered by all. Many people expected her to become the strongest Hero in history.</p>
<p>However, as Aileen grew stronger, she became lonelier.</p>
<p>To Aileen, who became a High-rank Hero at the tender age of thirteen, ‘friends’ were nothing more than a fantasy. Aileen turned to these stuffed animals to soothe her loneliness.</p>
<p>A penguin with glasses and a baby shark that sang songs.</p>
<p>“Huhu….”</p>
<p>She took a step back to examine the room she decorated. The longer she saw it, the more satisfied she became.</p>
<p>‘Now this is worth willing to save the world for,’ Aileen nodded her head in satisfaction when suddenly…</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>Someone knocked on her door. Aileen flinched.</p>
<p>“Guys, go hide for a minute.”</p>
<p>Aileen whispered, and her Spirit Speech activated right away.</p>
<p><em>Sssss….</em></p>
<p>Spirit Speech descended from the ceiling like a powder and concealed the animals from view.</p>
<p>“Okay, come in.”</p>
<p>As the door opened, Aileen returned to her chair and took out her laptop. She even started typing to pretend she was working.</p>
<p>“Oh, what are these? There’s a ton of snacks here.”</p>
<p>Aileen recognized the guest’s voice right away.</p>
<p>It was Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to give you any, so go awa…?”</p>
<p>Aileen turned around, declining Jin Seyeon’s request in advance.</p>
<p>But Jin Seyeon wasn’t alone. She was with Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun scratched the back of her neck nervously and bowed.</p>
<p>“Haha…. How are you, Captain Aileen? It’s me, Chae Nayun.”</p>
<p>“…Who are you? Where’s your team leader? What’s Yun Seung-Ah doing right now?”</p>
<p>“She’s training with Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>“…She’s flirting during a serious mission?”</p>
<p><em>Tzzt— Tzzt—</em></p>
<p>The moment Aileen frowned, the radio began crackling again. This time, a window popped up on her laptop screen. It was a video call.</p>
<p>—I have been informed that you finished setting up the fortress.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung’s face appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>“Yup, we did. What’s next?”</p>
<p>—We’ve got a plan going on our side currently. Soon, the person we hired will be rescuing our spy from Orden.</p>
<p>The Association had dispatched a spy into Orden’s territory about three months ago. They were able to win over a few people whom Orden had been trying to recruit.</p>
<p>“…Hired?”</p>
<p>—Yes. He’s skilled enough to break in unnoticed.</p>
<p>Aileen wasn’t convinced. The Association had deployed spies many times, but Orden had uncovered them all.</p>
<p>“Wait, are you sure that the spy’s trustworthy? What if he betrays us?”</p>
<p>—You can trust him.</p>
<p>The problem was the ‘vow’ that all spies had to take. This vow served as a safety net to prevent spies from turning on the Association. However, Orden possessed the ability to discern the difference in magic power caused by said vow. So, the spy this time was sent in without a vow, oath, or even a seal.</p>
<p>“…Well, I guess I have no choice but to trust him. How’s the mission going?”</p>
<p>—The rescue agent departed a few moments ago.</p>
<p>“And who is this rescue agent?”</p>
<p>—It’s someone you all know well.</p>
<p>Though Yi Gongmyung’s voice was full of confidence, his answer wasn’t enough to satisfy Aileen.</p>
<p>Aileen folded her arms with a frown.</p>
<p>“What’s his name?”</p>
<p>She asked again, and this time, Yi Gongmyung was straightforward.</p>
<p>—’Black Lotus’.</p>
<p>“…What?! Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>“What? For real?”</p>
<p>Not only Aileen but also Jin Seyeon and Chae Nayun were surprised.</p>
<p>—Yes, we entrusted Black Lotus with the mission to rescue the spy.</p>
<p>“What, are you serious?”</p>
<p>—Why would I lie about it?</p>
<p>“Uh…. Kuhum. No wonder that old geezer from the Association was brimming with confidence.”</p>
<p>Yi Yukho, the current chairman of the Association. When Aileen met him a week ago to discuss the current mission, that old, bald codger had told her not to worry.</p>
<p>“Black Lotus seems like a safe bet, as long as he doesn’t betray us.”</p>
<p>Though she sounded calm on the outside, Aileen was quite surprised. She never imagined the Association would hire Black Lotus. The present circumstance reminded her once again of the grave importance of their mission.</p>
<p>—Right. Black Lotus is currently heading towards…. Ah, he turned the camera on.</p>
<p>“Camera? Please show us!”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon shouted out of surprise. Chae Nayun also pushed her head towards the laptop screen.</p>
<p>“Ugh, get out of my way, all of you! Hey, do you even know who Black Lotus is?”</p>
<p>Aileen placed her hand on Chae Nayun’s cheek and pushed her away.</p>
<p>“Of course I do, though I’ve never met him in person.”</p>
<p>“Then you don’t really know him. Move!”</p>
<p>—I’ll share the view of Black Lotus’s camera with you.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung turned on the view that was connected to Black Lotus’ camera.</p>
<p><em>Pat!</em> With a tiny flash of light, the screen switched to a view of Orden’s palace.</p>
<p>—This is Black Lotus’ point of view. Coordinates are being updated in real time, so please assist him if the situation gets out of hand.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.”</p>
<p>Aileen, Chae Nayun, and Jin Seyeon all gathered around the screen.</p>
<p>At first, Black Lotus seemed to be wandering around the palace aimlessly.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, he rushed to the gate at the speed of light.</p>
<p>“Wow! Oh wow, he’s so freaking fast. Er, I mean… he’s really fast.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was thoroughly impressed with Black Lotus’ speed. But realizing that her language wasn’t appropriate given the situation, Chae Nayun slapped her mouth with her hand in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“You’re right, he’s very fast. He… seems to have gotten stronger.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon muttered. She wasn’t at all aware that the increase in Black Lotus’ speed was due to the equipment he had on.</p>
<p>Aileen also nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“He moves like lightning.”</p>
<p>“…It’s almost too pretentious for an archer.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard an unfamiliar voice.</p>
<p>—I’ve entered Orden’s palace.</p>
<p>It came from the laptop. It was Black Lotus’ voice.</p>
<p>At that moment, as he turned a corner, Black Lotus spotted a humanoid monster.</p>
<p>The monster seemed to be a guard on patrol. Black Lotus quickly hid behind a wall.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Look!”</p>
<p>The trio flinched in surprise.</p>
<p>—A monster is coming this way. I’ll dispose of him.</p>
<p>But Black Lotus was calm. He took out his bow and positioned an arrow against it. In the next moment, something mysterious happened.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—</em></p>
<p>The monster was definitely standing on the right side of the corner. However, Black Lotus aimed his arrow straight ahead. The arrow flew in a straight line, before suddenly warping to the right.</p>
<p><em>Crack—!</em></p>
<p>An impossible attack from a blind spot.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was unavoidable, and the humanoid monster fell to the ground after the arrow pierced his neck.</p>
<p>“That arrow just bent on its own. I’ve seen him do that before too,” Aileen muttered, pointing at the screen.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re right. It wasn’t even a magic arrow. Interesting…” Chae Nayun also chimed in but stopped when she suddenly felt a sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p>‘A self-bending arrow. Where have I seen that before…?’</p>
<p>“His skill is almost god-like.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon was also intrigued by Black Lotus’ skill.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here?”</p>
<p>The door swung open and Yun Seung-Ah entered the tent.</p>
<p>And she wasn’t alone. Kim Suho, her training partner, was also with her.</p>
<p>“Shhh. Be quiet. We’re watching Black Lotus right now.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah widened her eyes at Aileen’s remark.</p>
<p>Kim Suho couldn’t help but shout out in surprise.</p>
<p>“Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we recruited him for the mission. He’s on our side for now. How’s that? Our connections are pretty amazing, huh?”</p>
<p>Aileen smirked.</p>
<p>As a foe, Black Lotus was fearsome; but as a friend, he was more dependable than anyone else.</p>
<p>Aileen knew how annoying Black Lotus could be from the time he blocked the bridge on the 8th floor of the Tower of Wish. But this time he was on her side and there was nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>“Oh… let me see. I want to see too.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho joined the trio.</p>
<p>Though the tent became a little cramped for space, there was still enough room for everyone.</p>
<p>“What? Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>However, this wasn’t the end.</p>
<p>Suddenly the entire fortress started to buzz with voices, probably because of Kim Suho’s shout out from earlier.</p>
<p>“Where~?”</p>
<p>“Did you just say Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>More and more people started to pour in, and soon enough, Aileen’s tent was filled well beyond its maximum capacity.</p>
<p>“Dammit, I can’t see! Get lost, all of you!”</p>
<p>The tiny commander— Aileen yelled in annoyance.</p>
<p>But no one seemed to pay attention to her. Rather, they pushed Aileen away and nestled in front of the screen.</p>
<p>“Heh~ So this is from Black Lotus’ point of view? I was actually really curious about him. I’m going to watch how he plays~”</p>
<p>Nicholas from the Temple of Justice seemed especially excited.</p>
<p>This was due to the recently formed rivalry between the Temple of Justice and the Chameleon Troupe as the latter began to gain recognition among the public.</p>
<p>—I believe the spy is in a different building.</p>
<p>At that moment, Black Lotus spoke again.</p>
<p>He had just entered the palace. The inside was very spacious and filled with several different buildings.</p>
<p>—I’ll head there right away.</p>
<p>Black Lotus rushed towards one of the buildings.</p>
<p>But the scene that appeared on the screen next was simply absurd.</p>
<p>“Huh… that’s… a lot of monsters.” Jin Seyeon muttered.</p>
<p>Just as she said, the building was fiercely guarded. It was apparent even from afar.</p>
<p>There were at least a hundred monsters on land and a dozen in the sky.</p>
<p>—Can you make it?</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung asked Black Lotus. He was worried because he hadn’t expected there to be this many guards.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>There was a short silence, followed by a burst of small laughter.</p>
<p>—Piece of cake.</p>
<p>The screen changed swiftly.</p>
<p>Black Lotus was as fast as lightning but as silent as wind.</p>
<p>In only a second or so, Black Lotus had moved to a completely different location.</p>
<p>“Ooh~ Look at him go….”</p>
<p>Nicholas licked his lips with a grin.</p>
<p>“He’s really, really fast.”</p>
<p>“And he doesn’t make any sound when he moves.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho also voiced their opinions.</p>
<p>The audience(?) gathered in the commander’s tent admired every move Black Lotus made.</p>
<p>The first mission finally began.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 281. Commence (4)</p>
<p>Orden’s mansion looked very luxurious on the outside. I didn’t know how Orden learned to construct such a building, but I was impressed nonetheless.</p>
<p>—Can you make it?</p>
<p>A worried voice flowed out from the radio as I examined the mansion.</p>
<p>“Piece of Cake.”</p>
<p>I activated the [Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration] attached to my suit.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>My body moved much faster than I expected, at a speed far beyond that of sound. I knew I couldn’t control this speed as it was.</p>
<p>So I activated [Bullet Time].</p>
<p>Instantly, the world around me slowed down. I moved like the wind and made it inside the mansion in no time.</p>
<p>—…Successful infiltration confirmed.</p>
<p>‘Wow, that surprised me. That was some crazy speed.’</p>
<p>I calmed myself down and looked around, taking in my surroundings. The walls became transparent and I could see the entire mansion at a glance.</p>
<p>The number of humans in this building was… 33 in total, including Park Hanho, a former member of the Temple of Justice, and his revived daughter.</p>
<p>Park Hanho was reading his daughter a book. It was a surprisingly peaceful and humanly scene, which was a strange thing to say considering both were still humans.</p>
<p>‘More importantly, where is the spy?’</p>
<p>I turned my head slowly, searching for the spy.</p>
<p>As I scanned the rooms one by one, I discovered a likely candidate in the guest room on the 5th floor.</p>
<p>It was a woman. Her eyes kept wandering nervously.</p>
<p>There was a machine used to send the Morse codes at the foot of her bed.</p>
<p>“I think I just found the spy. Please confirm.”</p>
<p>I used [Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration] again.</p>
<p>Each floor was crawling with monsters, but I was confident they wouldn’t recognize me even as I pass by them, just as I was unaware of Kurukuru’s presence in the past.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa—</em></p>
<p>I arrived at the guest room on the 5th floor at the speed of light.</p>
<p>I appeared like the wind, quite literally.</p>
<p>“…Ah!”</p>
<p>The woman shook in surprise at my sudden entrance.</p>
<p>Her strawberry blonde hair and long arms and legs stood out.</p>
<p>She swallowed hard as she looked at me.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I waited for the confirmation in silence.</p>
<p>—Yes, she’s the one.</p>
<p>“…Hello.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the woman spoke.</p>
<p>“My name is Rumi.”</p>
<p>She seemed to have calmed down and even offered me her hand.</p>
<p>I examined the woman.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I felt like I’d seen her before….</p>
<p>—You may use the [Return Scroll] now.</p>
<p>But now was not the time to dwell on it.</p>
<p>“Do you have any belongings?”</p>
<p>Rumi nodded.</p>
<p>“I have them with me already. I brought my ‘Inventory’ from the Tower.”</p>
<p>“If you say so.”</p>
<p>I took out the [Return Scroll].</p>
<p>Then, just as I was about to tear it in half…</p>
<p>“Hi~”</p>
<p>A cold, unfamiliar voice suddenly approached me like a blade.</p>
<p>I tore the scroll without even looking back.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaak—!</em></p>
<p>The sharp sound of paper tearing rang out.</p>
<p>“Huhu. Where do you think you’re going?”</p>
<p>However, the scroll failed to activate due to obstructive magic power.</p>
<p>I turned around with a sigh of annoyance.</p>
<p>A humanoid monster who looked like a giant peacock stood before my eyes.</p>
<p>“Good thing I decided to act on my hunch~♪ I knew you were a traitor~♪”</p>
<p>From her appearance and the tone of her voice, I could tell this monster was female.</p>
<p>I frowned.</p>
<p>“…Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Mm… That’s none of your business~”</p>
<p>The humanoid monster suddenly began to sing.</p>
<p>“Here is the inescapable mystery….”</p>
<p>Her voice was mesmerizing and her rhythm was perfect. Her song spread abnormal magic power into the surroundings.</p>
<p>The magic power melted the room and reshaped our surroundings into what looked like a concert hall.</p>
<p>Everything became dark and quiet.</p>
<p>The stage and the seats were separated, and a beam of orange spotlight shone over the center of the stage. I felt as if classical music would suddenly start playing. I looked around this strange space in a daze.</p>
<p>‘Where am I, and what kind of an ability is this?”</p>
<p>“…She’s one of Orden’s elite monsters. Her name is Doloren, and she can imbue her songs with magic power. It’s similar to Spirit Speech but different. We’re inside Doloren’s barrier right now,” Rumi explained quickly.</p>
<p>“Aha.”</p>
<p>‘So that’s Doloren, one of the four monsters that’s new to the setting. Does she shed her feathers because she’s a bird? She’s different from what I saw on TV…’</p>
<p>“We… should’ve gotten out of here before she set up a barrier. It’s too late now.”</p>
<p>Rumi’s voice was tinged with despair. She bit her lips so hard that they started to bleed. It seemed she had already given up.</p>
<p>I asked, “It’s just a barrier. Why are you so scared?”</p>
<p>“It’s not just a simple barrier. You can’t escape from Doloren’s barrier. And rather than a barrier, it’s more of a world of its own.”</p>
<p>It was no surprise that Rumi knew about Doloren in detail; she was the spy, after all.</p>
<p>“There are only two audience members but that’s enough,” Doloren muttered as she climbed up the stage.</p>
<p>She stood on the podium like a conductor and looked down at us. Rumi turned white with fear, but I was confident I could breakthrough the current situation.</p>
<p>“But fundamentally it’s only a barrier, no?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>I pulled Rumi into my arms and took out the [Mystic Key].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Mystic Key] [Magic Artifact]</p>
<p>—A mystical key.</p>
<p>- Evolving Item — EXP 「90000/100000」</p>
<p>- Lv.8 Unlocking</p>
<p>※Was converted into an effective good through the 8-star card, [Card Conversion].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I had upgraded the Mystic Key tremendously using [Item Experience Coupons].</p>
<p>Even the most solid barriers should become powerless in front of it.</p>
<p>“The first number is Messiah by George Frideric Handel. Ahem….”</p>
<p>Doloren began warming up. She was completely at ease, probably because she had already concluded that we could never break out of her barrier.</p>
<p>I thrusted the key into the ground. Its tip sunk into the ground, and <em>click—</em> it was hooked. It had reached the core of the barrier.</p>
<p><em>Woooong….</em></p>
<p>I forced Stigma’s magic power into the key. This would surely strengthen it.</p>
<p>I then turned the key to the right with all my strength.</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>It sounded as if someone had pushed down on all the lowest keys on the piano at once.</p>
<p>Doloren’s concert hall turned into gravel.</p>
<p>“…What? What’s going on? My concert, where did it go?”</p>
<p>She looked around in confusion.</p>
<p>“Let’s run.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me? What are you— Kyak!”</p>
<p>I picked Rumi up and started running.</p>
<p>This was my third time using [Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration] today, yet I was just as fast as i was the first time. I could use this option without any limitation as long as I had the Orb of Regeneration with me.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at the underground fortress, everyone was already out of their tents, eagerly waiting for Black Lotus to return.</p>
<p>They all had witnessed Black Lotus’ triumph from the camera around his neck.</p>
<p>Their hearts sank when ‘Doloren’ appeared, as she was known to be as equally powerful as a Master-rank Hero. However, to their surprise, Black Lotus defeated her easily and escaped with the spy.</p>
<p>His performance was nothing less of perfection.</p>
<p>“I knew he was a good bet.”</p>
<p>Aileen nodded with satisfaction. Today, she had witnessed the true strength of Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“Right. And I’m really curious how he broke that barrier. What do you think, Aileen? That barrier didn’t have any noticeable weakness in it. That monster looked confused, too.”</p>
<p>Nicholas was overcome with excitement and curiosity.</p>
<p>“Hey Nayun, do you think he’d be willing to take a photo with me? I think I’ll be able to get, like, 300 million likes if I post it online.”</p>
<p>That last remark was Yi Jiyoon’s.</p>
<p>Other Heroes also looked forward to meeting Black Lotus. They didn’t expect him to answer all their questions, but still they were thrilled to finally meet Black Lotus in person.</p>
<p>“Ah, he’s here!”</p>
<p>With her extraordinary eyesight, Jin Seyeon was the first to point to the other side of the tunnel. Everyone turned to where she pointed, and soon, two silhouettes appeared on the other side.</p>
<p>It was Black Lotus and the spy Rumi.</p>
<p>Rather than waiting for the two to come, the Heroes went to greet them. Aileen, as the commander in chief, stood in front of Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“Oi, it’s been a while.” Aileen greeted.</p>
<p>Black Lotus remained silent. He handed Rumi over to Parma, who was known as the ‘Saint’. Rumi had fainted after failing to withstand Black Lotus’ supersonic speed.</p>
<p>“…Hey, don’t you know me?”</p>
<p>Aileen frowned, thinking Black Lotus just ignored her.</p>
<p>Black Lotus’ answer was short.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“Then why are you ignoring me like that?”</p>
<p>“It’s not my job to look after you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Aileen’s face turned slightly red. Few muffled laughters broke out behind her.</p>
<p>“I never asked you to look after me! Be courteous, you!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Black Lotus looked beyond Aileen. His gaze moved across Kim Suho, Nicholas, Yun Seung-Ah, Shin Jonghak, Jin Seyeon, then Chae Nayun. His gaze lingered on Chae Nayun for slightly longer. Having noticed it, Chae Nayun tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving now, but be sure to tell me the information that the spy discovered.”</p>
<p>Black Lotus turned around, but Aileen’s high-pitched voice stopped him.</p>
<p>“Do you have any other business to take care of?”</p>
<p>As an ally, Black Lotus was more dependable than anyone else. Seeing as Black Lotus and Orden were archenemies, Aileen wanted to keep Black Lotus on her side at least until they defeated Orden. Black Lotus could secure their rear, attack the front, and even assist other Heroes from the back.</p>
<p>He would be the perfect addition to the team.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>However, Black Lotus neither looked back nor spoke.</p>
<p>An eagle suddenly flew in from a distance and landed on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hey! Answer me before you leave!”</p>
<p>Black Lotus answered Aileen in a nonchalant voice.</p>
<p>“Contact the Chameleon Troupe if you want to recruit me.”</p>
<p>And that was all he had to say.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, before you leave, can you maybe take just one photo with m-… uup!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and Kim Suho managed to stop Yi Jiyoon before she could finish her sentence.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, Black Lotus turned into a handful of dust and disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>Silence descended on the fortress.</p>
<p>The Heroes all stared at the spot where Black Lotus had just stood.</p>
<p>The man came and left quite literally like the wind. Black Lotus should have been the enemy of Heroes, yet a sense of gratitude filled their hearts.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak. Yi Jiyoon and Jin Seyeon. Chae Nayun and Yun Seung-Ah….</p>
<p>Each member of the Task Force now had their own story of Black Lotus to tell.</p>
<p>And their stories would soon spread to the rest of the world in the form of rumors.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[World of Wish, 8F Crevon]</p>
<p>On a starry night in Crevon, Margrave Tomer was having teatime with a guest in the reception room of her mansion. The atmosphere was rather grave.</p>
<p>Staring at the dark clouds outside her window, Tomer muttered with a sigh.</p>
<p>“A lot has changed ever since the 30th floor crumbled down.”</p>
<p>When Kim Suho cleared the final floor of the Tower, Crevon was under a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Cults heralded the end of Crevon one after the other. Some sought to overthrow the current regime.</p>
<p>However, this period of turmoil only served to bring Crevon together.</p>
<p>Araha, the fifth princess of Crevon, declared herself the king, finally unleashing all the ambition that she had tried so hard to keep hidden over the past years. She launched a series of innovative and radical policies to address the people’s concerns.</p>
<p>Araha also recruited a number of skilled Players and regularly sent them on expeditions to the 9th floor. Half of the 9th floor that was once crawling with mythical monsters was now cleared out, and that was clearly a triumph on her part.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>Tomer asked the guest while sipping on tea.</p>
<p>Recent changes had put her in a rather tricky political situation.</p>
<p>“…I <em>am</em> worried.”</p>
<p>The clinking sound of iron resounded throughout the room along with a low-pitched voice.</p>
<p>The guest, a giant man, stared down at the cup in front of him, which was barely the size of his thumb, before picking it up and placing it on his palm.</p>
<p>Tomer gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“So even you’re scared, Lü Bu?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Lü Bu did not answer. He only grabbed his Square Sky Halberd with the hand that wasn’t holding the cup.</p>
<p>However, before long, he raised his head again and stared Tomer in the eye.</p>
<p>“I heard that Earth will also transform into the Demon Realm.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, that was the prophecy.”</p>
<p>The highest-ranking administrators of the Tower of Wish—Buddha, Jesus, and other saints—had already ascended to Heaven. They left behind a single prophecy before they left.</p>
<p>[Demonic energy shall invade the blue world. We hope you will all work together to overcome this ordeal.]</p>
<p>“But… the prophecy only applies to the outside world,” Tomer muttered and glanced at Lü Bu, anticipating his response.</p>
<p>The outside world.</p>
<p>Tomer had begun to refer to Earth as the outside world.</p>
<p>She recalled her parents. Earth had left nothing but scars on Tomer’s family. This was the reason she did not want to leave Crevon. Tomer cherished the peaceful life she had here.</p>
<p>“Do you wish to descend as well, General Lü Bu?”</p>
<p>But others had very different opinions. Not only the administrators but also Lü Bu, Lancelot, and practically anyone who originated from Earth wanted to descend onto the outside world.</p>
<p>Lü Bu turned his head slowly and glared at Tomer.</p>
<p>“I’m merely following my lord.”</p>
<p>“Right, and your lord is here in Crevon. Yet you worry about Earth.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Lü Bu clenched his teeth, which made his chin appear more threatening. Tomer stared back at him without being intimidated.</p>
<p>As the atmosphere between the two began to grow hostile….</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange vibration shook their surroundings.</p>
<p>Tomer and Lü Bu stopped and looked around in confusion.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before a message window popped up in front of Tomer.</p>
<p>[There has been a huge change to the System.]</p>
<p>Only Tomer could see this message because she was simultaneously an NPC and a Player.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened as she read it.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The sky was dark without a hint of light.</p>
<p>I returned to Pandemonium. After a quick shower, I headed straight to Boss’ office to give her a report of the mission.</p>
<p>“You’re back.”</p>
<p>Boss greeted me with her usual nonchalant look.</p>
<p>“I already received the news that you succeeded.”</p>
<p>“Did you get the reward?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Chameleon Troupe is now officially pardoned. Though I’m not sure how long we can manage to stay off that list this time….”</p>
<p>With a chuckle, Boss got up from her seat and came up to me.</p>
<p>“You did well.”</p>
<p>Boss stared at me. Then she leaned over and hung something around my neck. It was a necklace.</p>
<p>“This is better than the one I gave to you when you first joined. I got this from the Association in exchange for accepting their newest request. You earned it, so you keep it.”</p>
<p>[Heimdallr’s Necklace] was its name. You could tell from its name how priceless this necklace was.</p>
<p>“This is….”</p>
<p>I was surprised that of all people Boss had chosen to give this to me. I knew from her official setting that she was an avid jewelry lover.</p>
<p>Grateful, I held the necklace up to examine it in detail.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>I felt a huge vibration echo off the walls.</p>
<p>At the same time, several windows popped up, blocking my view.</p>

<p>Chapter 282. Great Change (1)</p>
<p>[England, Buckingham Palace]</p>
<p>After subjugating Toji, Heynckes was received hospitably by the English government. Heynckes didn’t want the public to find out about his return, and England did its best to stop the information from getting out. As a result, Heynckes stayed in England for two more days before returning to the Himalayas.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>With Heynckes gone, today was the last day Yoo Yeonha would stay in Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>She stood in front of a mirror in her room and checked her outfit.</p>
<p>She was wearing a black dress designed by the world-class designer, Yi Yoojoong, a pinnacle-grade artifact called ‘Siren’s Black Pearl Necklace’, and an ancient Silla artifact called ‘Bronze Necklace’. Together with the beautiful Buckingham Palace, her beauty stood out even more.</p>
<p>“Huhu.”</p>
<p>Every time she saw herself in the mirror, she couldn’t help but thank her parents. She couldn’t imagine how they managed to pass down only the best genes.</p>
<p>Immersed in confidence, she made various poses, smiling like a cute girl, biting her lips like a seductress, and looking stern like a worried CEO.</p>
<p>She was well aware of the benefits her beauty brought. She had experienced it firsthand in business. Her appearance exuded trust and evoked admiration, boosting the image of her guild even more.</p>
<p>There was a reason that Yoo Yeonha was the face of Essence of the Strait.</p>
<p>…But her appearance had never garnered ‘love’ from anyone.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>A sense of skepticism suddenly swept through her. Yoo Yeonha clicked her tongue and turned away from the mirror.</p>
<p>But the feeling of helplessness didn’t go away easily. She subconsciously thought of Shin Jonghak. She had liked him ever since she was a kid but gave up on him after realizing he would never be hers.</p>
<p>‘How did I come to like him?’</p>
<p>It was a tale from a long time ago.</p>
<p>“Haaa….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha sat down on the corner of her bed and recalled her first meeting with Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>…The official name was probably ‘Guild and Business Friendship Conference.’ It was a social gathering for corporate leaders and top-class guild executives.</p>
<p>As adults and their children all attended, the 5-year-old Yoo Yeonha looked forward to the conference. She was just as ambitious back then as she was now.</p>
<p>That day, she tried on dozens of dresses with her mother. Although her mother was also passionate, Yoo Yeonha was even more heated up. What dress to wear, what accessories to pick, she spent 7 hours worrying about her outfit.</p>
<p>—How do I look, Father?</p>
<p>The dress she finally picked was similar to the one she was wearing now. A black dress and a necklace to make her look mature.</p>
<p>—Adorable, Yeonha!</p>
<p>—A-Ah, stop! You’re going to make my dress wrinkly! Stooop!</p>
<p>Her father hugged her with a hearty laugh, and Yoo Yeonha remembered being angry at her father for making her dress wrinkly.</p>
<p>Not long after picking her dress, her uncle, Yoo Jinhyuk, who was a rising-star Hero at the time, also arrived. Together, they headed to the conference.</p>
<p>The conference was held in the garden of Chae Joochul’s grand mansion.</p>
<p>—Wow….</p>
<p>Fancy classical music played in the background, and beautiful flowers glistened under the sun. Yoo Yeonha’s eyes widened from the clear weather and scenic view. Although she came from a rich family, the Immortal’s grand mansion had a certain noble charm that she didn’t see in her home.</p>
<p>—Oh, if it isn’t Air Blitz Yoo Jinwoong!</p>
<p>—Haha, Leader Yoon Youngho, it’s nice to see you.</p>
<p>—No need for greetings. Follow me, Shin Myungchul brought an amazing child with him. Her name is Aileen. She was born with an extremely rare Gift called ‘Spirit Speech’.</p>
<p>—Oh?</p>
<p>Her father and mother disappeared with Leader Yoo Youngho. Uncle Yoo Jinhyuk led her to the place where all the children were gathered. It was a playground built just for young kids. Yoo Yeonha puffed her cheeks unhappily.</p>
<p>—Uncle Jinhyuk, can’t I say hi to adults too? Kids are boring.</p>
<p>—Nope, you can’t.</p>
<p>—But why?</p>
<p>—The goal of this conference is ‘making connections’. Your parents will take care of the adults, and it’s your job to connect with other kids. Your parents' connections will eventually become yours anyways. Plus, you’re only five-years-old. Don’t go around calling kids boring when you’re one too.</p>
<p>What Yoo Jinhyuk was saying made sense.</p>
<p>Left with no choice, Yoo Yeonha went to the kids’ playground. There, she saw ten or so kids her age.</p>
<p><em>Huu… huu….</em></p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha collected her breath before approaching them.</p>
<p>—Hello, my name is Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>30 minutes was enough.</p>
<p>With her conversational skills and beauty, she captured the hearts of the other kids. Just when she was sure she became the main character of the meeting…</p>
<p>—Ugh, annoying.</p>
<p>A boyish girl appeared. She was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. The upset girl sighed and sat down on a nearby chair.</p>
<p>At first, Yoo Yeonha was dumbstruck. How could someone come to such a noble meeting in that getup?</p>
<p>But she soon realized she could just ignore the girl. Yoo Yeonha snorted and invited her newly made connections to eat some pudding.</p>
<p>—This pudding is great. Would you like to try… some?</p>
<p>However, most of the kids around her had already disappeared.</p>
<p>‘Where did they go?’ Yoo Yeonha looked around, confused. Then, she saw them flattering the boyish girl.</p>
<p>—…Eh?</p>
<p>The words, ‘Nayun, Nayun—‘, entered her dazed ears. It was then that she realized who the girl was.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Daehyun’s youngest daughter and the granddaughter Chae Joochul adored.</p>
<p>That was when Yoo Yeonha met Chae Nayun for the first time, and it was also when she felt inferior for the first time. But she refused to yield. She believed she was superior in appearance and clothing.</p>
<p>—…Hello, how old are you? I’m five.</p>
<p>She tried her best to recapture the attention of the other kids… but it was futile. The sons and daughters of mid-sized guilds left for other nobles when the chance came.</p>
<p>The ‘noble’ wasn’t necessarily Chae Nayun. Sons and daughters of more honorable guilds and corporations, they seemed to possess ‘something’ that was even more important than appearance.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Yoo Yeonha realized she wasn’t the main character. That she was only an extra.</p>
<p>The young and proud Yoo Yeonha was sad that she wasn’t at the center of the meeting. Her resentment was pointed toward Chae Nayun, who became the center of the meeting in only jeans and a t-shirt.</p>
<p>She held back her tears and glared at Chae Nayun. Although she was surrounded by many people, she seemed annoyed by it.</p>
<p>—…That girl. Bad, stupid, idiot…</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha ate pudding as she sobbed. Only the sweetness of her pudding consoled her.</p>
<p>It was then that ‘Shin Jonghak’ appeared in her life.</p>
<p>—Is that pudding good?</p>
<p>His voice was childish, yet full of confidence. He wasn’t talking in polite speech, but Yoo Yeonha didn’t care.</p>
<p>‘Someone came to me!’</p>
<p>Just that one fact made her happy. Yoo Yeonha wiped her tears elegantly and turned around.</p>
<p>There, she saw a handsome boy who seemed to have popped out of a painting.</p>
<p>She asked in a daze.</p>
<p>—…Who are you?</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak smirked, then said softly.</p>
<p>—Shin Jonghak. My grandfather is Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>—Shing Myungchul…?</p>
<p>—It’s Shin Myungchul, not Shing Myungchul.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s eyes widened. There wasn’t anyone in the world who didn’t know Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak seemed to have liked her huge reaction as he stayed and consoled her.</p>
<p>—Don’t worry about those guys. They’re only puppets of their parents.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak must have spoken from jealousy. Since he liked Chae Nayun for the longest time, he must have disliked seeing Chae Nayun surrounded by other guys.</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha didn’t know that at the time.</p>
<p>—People who chase after special people without trying to become special themselves only end up as trash.</p>
<p>He was just as arrogant then as he was now.</p>
<p>—…Un, okay….</p>
<p>Back then, he seemed like the coolest, most wonderful person in the world.</p>
<p>That was the memory from her childhood. When she recalled it now, her heart didn’t thump like it used to.</p>
<p>About 12 years later, Yoo Yeonha met another man.</p>
<p>A man who didn’t have anything to his name but continued to get on her nerves.</p>
<p>Although she was annoyed, even ignoring him and reproaching him, he saved her life. Not only that, but he also turned her life around forever.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Thanks to him, she was able to become a ‘noble person’ like she always wanted to be. Essence of the Strait became the number 1 guild in the world and entered the top 10 of corporate entities.</p>
<p>She had achieved the ambition she always had…</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>A knock interrupted her recollection. Yoo Yeonha shot up from her bed, startled.</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>—Um, it’s Rachel. I heard you were leaving, so I came to see you off.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha straightened the hem of her dress and opened the door.</p>
<p>Rachel was standing right in front of her. She seemed tired from having to deal with Shin Yeohwa, but she greeted Yoo Yeonha with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“You look great. Are you ready to go?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“…Yeonha-ssi?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha glared at Rachel silently. Rachel was acting subservient and modest as always.</p>
<p>In a way, it was to be expected. Yoo Yeonha knew she had risen to a position where she could determine the fate of a country. With little exaggeration, she could end England if she set her mind to it.</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was displeased with Rachel’s attitude. The emotion she felt towards Chae Nayun that day surfaced once again.</p>
<p>She couldn’t hold back.</p>
<p>She shot the pent-up feelings she carried in her heart at Rachel.</p>
<p>“What relationship do you have with Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Rachel’s shoulders flinched.</p>
<p>“Pardon? What do you mean—”</p>
<p>“Don’t act like you don’t know.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha turned serious.</p>
<p>“The child you ran off with two days ago, I saw her in Seoul. At the time, she wasn’t with you but with Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Rachel didn’t say anything. As far as Yoo Yeonha was aware, the silence was the same thing as an answer.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask again.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s face turned serious.</p>
<p>She clenched her teeth and asked straightforwardly while sharpening a knife in her heart.</p>
<p>“Did you sleep with Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>The moment she asked that question.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>A boundless magic power began to pour down from an unknown place.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Final Arc ▷ ‘You Can’t Jump Off a Running Train’]</p>
<p>[Earth’s Demon Realm Transformation is progressing… 3% Complete.]</p>
<p>[Calculating Towers that have not been conquered.]</p>
<p>[Tower of Miracles, Tower of Eternity, Tower of Beasts, Tower of Sorrow, Tower of Despair…]</p>
<p>[…A total of 13 Towers were found. The power of these 13 Towers will be released to the outside world.]</p>
<p>“…Hajin, magic power just—”</p>
<p>“Fuck, what now?”</p>
<p>“Eh… w-what?”</p>
<p>A sudden change to the system in the name of an ‘arc’.</p>
<p>Unable to hold back my anger, I ran towards the window and looked up.</p>
<p>Then, I lost all words.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—</em></p>
<p>Thousands of shooting stars were falling from the sky, illuminating the darkness.</p>
<p>A meteor shower.</p>
<p>Rich writing appeared on the shooting stars. I was most likely the only one who could see it.</p>
<p>「Enough time has passed since the destruction of the Tower of Wish’s shell. But during this time, humanity paid little attention to conquering the remaining Towers. They had little choice because of the great enemy known as Orden.</p>
<p>Tower of Miracles, Tower of Eternity, Tower of Beasts, Tower of Sorrow, Tower of Despair… a total of 13 unconquered Towers have released their powers. It was because of the ‘rejective force’ resulting from the materialization of the Tower of Wish. Their powers served as a catalyst for hastening Earth’s Demon Realm Transformation.</p>
<p>…Now, meteorites are falling on the world. The meteorites contain hundreds of demonic monsters, demon merchants, and destruction-hungry demons. This is the start of the Demon Realm Transformation.</p>
<p>But this Demon Realm Transformation wasn’t a simple phenomenon like the one from the Tower of Wish. ‘Not all demons are enemies’. The Demon Realm Transformation will change Earth and bring about a new age….」</p>
<p>“The fuck does that mean, you piece of shit?”</p>
<p>I cursed at the sky, looking at the words I couldn’t understand. Then…</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>A few meteorites exploded as they landed. The earth rumbled and smoke rose up.</p>
<p>[Rewards have been granted to all of humanity for clearing the Tower of Wish — ‘Blessing of the Saints’ has been activated.]</p>
<p>[A new system has been initialized.]</p>
<p>[Interesting, your system is level 6, the only Player to have surpassed level 4.]</p>

<p>“Boss?”</p>
<p>I turned to Boss. She seemed to be experiencing the same phenomenon as she was staring into the air.</p>
<p>—Grrrk.</p>
<p>—Grrrk.</p>
<p>Next, strange roars began to ring outside. I widened my eyes and looked outside the window.</p>
<p>—Grrrk.</p>
<p>From the meteorites pinned to the ground, hundreds of demonic beasts were crawling out.</p>
<p>[Arc Progress – Demonic beasts of the Demon Realm invade humanity.]</p>
<p>[Countless ‘Dungeons’, ‘Mirror Worlds’, and other battlefields will be created.]</p>
<p>[Every time a Dungeon is cleared, or a demonic beast is killed, you will receive DP (Dark Points).]</p>
<p>[DP can be gained by ‘anyone’ and can be spent in ‘demon towns’ or with ‘demon merchants’.]</p>
<p>[Note, demon merchants and demon towns are not your enemies. They are ‘neutral entities’ who wish to seek benefits through this war.]</p>
<p>[You can convert SP to DP.]</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a black demonic beast jumped through the window and landed on me. I swung my hand subconsciously. The demonic beast was cut in half cleanly.</p>
<p>“…The hell?”</p>
<p>I looked down at my palm, which had suddenly become sharp.</p>
<p>[7 points of sharpness will be imbued in all actions you make.]</p>
<p>[You obtain 5 DP from killing a demonic beast.]</p>
<p>“What just….”</p>
<p>“Hajin?”</p>
<p>As I was murmuring in bewilderment, Boss called my name.</p>
<p>I turned on the TV without answering her.</p>
<p>—Emergency report. The world is experiencing an unprecedented meteor shower. These meteorites are causing huge explosions; civilians are recommended to stay inside….</p>
<p>“No, Hajin.”</p>
<p>Boss tapped on my shoulders like she was frustrated.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“L-Look over there.”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>I turned to the direction Boss was pointing to.</p>
<p>Three minutes ago, it was a vast field in Central Asia with nothing to note.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the case now.</p>
<p>General stores, clothing stores, weapon stores, magic stores, and others…. Benches surrounded a pond in a plaza with 4-story high inns. There were even existences that looked like people.</p>
<p>A meteorite had struck and created a new town.</p>
<p>“…What’s that?”</p>
<p>The system returned an answer to my confused murmuring.</p>
<p>[They are ‘demon merchants’, beings who came to Earth through the meteorites. Demon merchants are fundamentally different from demons, devils, Djinns, and demonic beasts. Demons are not a single race, only referring to those who came from the Demon Realm. Demons have different settings depending on what race they belong to.]</p>
<p>[Devils will employ Djinns and demonic beasts to conquer Earth. Humanity will try to stop them. These ‘demon merchants’ are here only to reap benefits from the two sides’ war.]</p>
<p>[They will sell you anything, whether it be technology to annihilate members of their own race, weapons, magic, or whatever. As long as you have DP, that is.]</p>
<p>[How is it? Not so boring anymore, right?]</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me, you son of a bitch…”</p>
<p>Seeing the last sentence, I couldn’t hold back my anger.</p>
<p>“Huu…”</p>
<p>But being angry wouldn’t change anything.</p>
<p>I calmed myself. There was something I needed to do.</p>
<p>I took out the [Purifying Crystal] from my Stigma.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Boss discovered something else.</p>
<p>“…Hajin.”</p>
<p>She pointed at the sky with her trembling hand.</p>
<p>‘What now?’ I looked up, somewhat fearful of what I would see next.</p>
<p>Immediately, my thoughts stopped.</p>
<p>“…A dragon.”</p>
<p>Boss murmured quietly.</p>
<p>Boss and I looked up at the sky in a daze.</p>
<p>It wasn't something like the Human Dragon Aileen, but an actual dragon.</p>
<p>In the sky, a member of the mystical race known as dragons was circling the moon.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ is this for fucking real….”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but curse. I had not cursed in a long time, but this damned co-author just wouldn't let me be.</p>
<p><em>Chap—</em></p>
<p>“Uk!”</p>
<p>Boss hit my mouth with her hand.</p>
<p>When I looked at her confused, she gave me a coy look.</p>
<p>“Don’t curse.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, okay.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 283. Great Change (2)</p>
<p>[44 days left until the start of the first development - ‘Advent of the Calamity’.]</p>
<p>[As the original author, you are given the privilege of accessing the outline of the development.]</p>
<p>[You may access the outline using your original Gift, ‘Observation and Reading’.]</p>
<p>[And don’t forget, you have the right to ask me a question or a favor.]</p>
<p>I ran with Boss to where the meteorite fell. After 3 minutes of running, we finally began to see a village that had appeared only a few moments ago. The village looked similar to the one I saw in Akatrina. Houses were made of bricks, like a classic Middle Age design.</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just us who came. Djinns and mercenaries of Pandemonium also gathered at the village. A few rambunctious Djinns seemed to anticipate a fight. However, most calmly observed the Demon Realm village which was shrouded in a dark fog.</p>
<p>“As I thought, you’re here too.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a familiar voice called us. I pushed my hood down further, and Boss looked at our ‘business partner’.</p>
<p>It was Wicked—a member of the Nine Evils.</p>
<p>Boss asked Wicked, “Do you know anything about the current situation?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>Wicked shook her head, and so did the three executives who were with her.</p>
<p>So far, I had released only three of her six executives. I set aside the remaining three for later use in case we needed to negotiate with Wicked again. This was the way I intended to keep things for a while since Wicked’s Gift allowed her to become stronger as the number of her followers increased.</p>
<p>“…This phenomenon seems to be related to the Demon Realm. How can you not know what’s going on? Aren’t you a Djinn?” Boss probed.</p>
<p>“Djinns aren’t from the Demon Realm. I only serve my lord devil. I have no idea what’s going on either. Let’s head inside together and find out.”</p>
<p>Wicked’s explanation made sense, so we headed to the village together.</p>
<p>The village was pretty big and divided into different sectors. We continued to walk, taking in our surroundings when suddenly an Aileen-sized demon jumped out in front us from the corner of the street.</p>
<p>—Hello!</p>
<p>Frankly, I was pretty surprised (as was Boss and Wicked), but my pride wouldn’t allow me to jump in fear.</p>
<p>Wicked exchanged glances with her underlings. One of her executives stepped forward with a stern look.</p>
<p>“Who are you? Reveal yourself.”</p>
<p>—Mm. So we <em>can</em> communicate. That’s good.</p>
<p>As expected, the demon spoke Korean. He was small but had big curved horns growing out of his temple.</p>
<p>“Tell us about yourself and what you’re doing here.”</p>
<p>—My name is Kuong and I’m a merchant. Though I’m still trying to figure everything out….</p>
<p>I used [Original Author’s Privilege] on the demon.</p>
<p>「Demon Realm Merchant Kuong」</p>
<p>[Life Force 100/100]</p>
<p>[Alignment — Neutral]</p>
<p>[Realm — Stage-1 Average]</p>
<p>[Job — Middle-grade merchant]</p>
<p>[Status — Speaking the truth]</p>
<p>—I have a lot of things for sale that will be of help to you. Here, please take a look.</p>
<p>Kuong showed us his shop's catalog.</p>
<p>[Special potion]</p>
<p>[Protective Wall]</p>
<p>[Artifacts from Other Dimensions]</p>
<p>[Mercenary for Hire]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Body Enhancer]</p>
<p>[State of Existence Enhancer]</p>
<p>—You can buy these items with DP, which is the currency we use in our world. You can earn them by hunting demonic beasts. Ah, do you know what demonic beasts are? They’re not much different from monsters. When monsters become contaminated in the land of the Demon Realm, they become what we call demonic beasts. I highly recommend this item here, ‘State of Existence Enhancer’! It’s expensive but worth all the cost!</p>
<p>“Land of the Demon Realm? Are you referring to Demon Realm Transformation?”</p>
<p>Boss frowned. People who participated in the Tower of Wish were all somewhat aware of ‘Demon Realm Transformation’.</p>
<p>—Yes. Today’s meteorites mark the beginning of Demon Realm Transformation. If you fail to work together to fight back, Earth will completely transform into the Demon Realm in no time.</p>
<p>All three of us fell silent. A sense of shock swept through us.</p>
<p>I looked down at the Demon Realm Merchant ‘Kuong’ and spoke in an intimidating tone.</p>
<p>“We get DP from killing demonic beasts… so what happens if I kill you?”</p>
<p>—Pardon?</p>
<p>“Can I earn DP by killing you?”</p>
<p>—Oh, but you can’t kill me. I’m only a hologram. My physical body is in the real Demon Realm.</p>
<p>[Status — Speaking the truth]</p>
<p>I didn’t exactly plan on killing him but regretted not being able to.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>—There’s no use killing us anyway. We’re willing to do anything for you as long as you pay us DP.</p>
<p>“…Geez, another form of currency.”</p>
<p>DP, TP, SP. It was starting to get a little bit confusing… but that was no reason to shun them.</p>
<p>I did have a talent for making money. Even if I was to suddenly become stranded in the middle of nowhere without anything on me, as long as that place was somewhere in this world, I could survive without worry. Just like the saying went, success was a little bit of skill and a whole lot of luck.</p>
<p>“Do you have casinos here?”</p>
<p>—Ah~ The higher-grade merchants run them. But I do have lottery tickets!</p>
<p>“…Yeah?”</p>
<p>—Yep. They cost 20 DP per ticket and you can see the result instantly. First place winner gets 1,500,000 DP, second place winner gets 150,000 DP, third place gets 15,000 DP….</p>
<p>I could make 1.5 million DP with just 20 DP. Of course, just like all lottery, the chances of winning were probably slim to none. Kuong proceeded to explain.</p>
<p>— The chance of winning first place is 1 in 30,000,000. For the second place, it’s 1 in 9,000,000. For the third place, 1 in 300,000….</p>
<p>1 in 30,000,000.</p>
<p>1 in 9,000,000.</p>
<p>1 in 300,000.</p>
<p>At a glance, these numbers seemed insanely low, but why was it that I couldn’t stop the corner of mouth from twitching upwards in joy? I tried to appear calm.</p>
<p>“That’s pretty bad, huh?”</p>
<p>—The chances are pretty low, but we sell these tickets in other dimensions and worlds, so I do hope you understand~</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, it’s alright.”</p>
<p>It didn’t matter how low the chances were.</p>
<p>I was confident that my superhuman luck stat of 9.1 points would bring me a tremendous amount of DP, despite the ridiculously low probability.</p>

<p>「VIOLET’s gossip - Black Lotus Q&amp;A」</p>
<p>Q. Why does Black Lotus oppose Orden?</p>
<p>A. I don’t know the details, but I think there’s a reason behind his hostility. Like, his family members were murdered by Orden or something.</p>
<p>Q. How strong is Black Lotus really?</p>
<p>A. I can answer this question with confidence. Black Lotus is equally as powerful as—if not more than—Chae Joochul. Chae Joochul is old, so I expect Black Lotus to take the lead as time goes on.</p>
<p>Q. Really? We know that Swordsman of Wish Kim Suho is also very powerful, and ‘Fenrir’ has killed Black Lotus once before.</p>
<p>A. I heard Kim Suho also acknowledged Black Lotus. In fact, Kim Suho might be stronger than Black Lotus in a fair 1 on 1 fight. But considering all other factors, I have to say that no Hero can stand against Black Lotus. As for Fenrir… I decline to comment. But I still think Black Lotus is stronger than Fenrir.</p>
<p>Q. What kind of atmosphere did Black Lotus have?</p>
<p>A. …He looked sad. He was cold, but I could spot a very human weakness in him. I feel like he has a deep scar in his heart, one that can’t be erased. Even his nonchalant attitude couldn’t hide his sorrow. He was a wounded beast… or a fragile snowflake.</p>
<p>Q. If that’s true, why do you think Black Lotus is so hurt?</p>
<p>A. I’m not sure. There could be many reasons. His battle against Orden, or that duel against Fenrir in the Tower of Wish, or maybe it’s the Association’s oppression….</p>
<p>But more than anything, I think it’s because Black Lotus is noble. He has the world at his feet and he leads the Chameleon Troupe. The higher you go, the colder and more fierce it gets.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yi Jiyoon was in the middle of spreading rumors through Violet Banquet. Though these rumors were all derived from her delusions, she didn’t feel guilty. In her mind, these rumors wouldn’t cause any harm to Black Lotus; plus, she really believed that her analysis was true.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap— Tap, tap—</em></p>
<p>She accumulated more and more Violet Banquet points as the sound of keyboard typing grew louder.</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon’s Violet Banquet ID grade was an astounding [Blue Diamond]. This was the reason people believed whatever she said without even thinking to cross-check the facts.</p>
<p>“….Mm. I should check up on my social media account now.”</p>
<p>After she finished the Q&amp;A, Yi Jiyoon turned Violet Banquet off and pulled up her official social media account.</p>
<p>[Yi Jiyoon]</p>
<p>[Posts 2,480] [Follower 36.3M] [Following 103]</p>
<p>“Huhu.”</p>
<p>Fellow members of the ‘Orden Assassination Team’ treated the high-intermediate-rank grade-1 Yi Jiyoon as nothing but an immature supporter. But on the internet, she was an extremely popular celebrity thanks to her excellent ‘image marketing strategy’.</p>
<p>On her official social media account, she gained worldwide popularity by posting photos of her with other famous Heroes such as Chae Nayun, Yoo Yeonha, Kim Suho, and Shin Jonghak. On Violet Banquet, she ran a secret website called [VIOLET’s gossip], where she posted gossip like the earlier Q&amp;A. Her initial goal was to earn Violet Banquet points, but along the way she had gained a lot of followers.</p>
<p>—So all you do is sell?</p>
<p>“…They’re still not done?”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon turned her smartwatch off and got up from her seat.</p>
<p>She opened the door slightly and looked outside through the gap. Aileen was still interrogating a demon.</p>
<p>—Yes, all we do is sell goods.</p>
<p>“How do you expect me to believe that?”</p>
<p>After countless meteorites landed on Earth, the underground fortress went through a huge change as well. One meteor passed through the ground and became a ‘shop’ stationed just outside the fortress.</p>
<p>—Look at us. We’re not built to fight. I’m shorter than you.</p>
<p>The demon twirled.</p>
<p>“…You’re kidding, right? Well, it’s true that you’re shorter than me.”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon stepped outside and stood next to Chae Nayun and Kim Suho, who were watching Aileen.</p>
<p>“Nayun, Suho, is she still not finished?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“No, but I think it’ll be over soon. Ah, right. What kind of stat did you get?”</p>
<p>‘Stat?’ Yi Jiyoon wondered what Kim Suho meant. Then, she realized he was referring to the ‘great change’ that happened last night.</p>
<p>“Oh, I got ‘Buff’. How about you two?”</p>
<p>“I got ‘Tenacity’ and ‘Extremity’.”</p>
<p>“Mine’s ‘Amplification’.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho received Tenacity and Extremity. Chae Nayun received Amplification.</p>
<p>“Huh? Why do you have two, Suho?”</p>
<p>“Um… I’m not really sure.”</p>
<p>“Maybe because he cleared the Tower of Wish?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun tapped on Kim Suho’s chest. Kim Suho drew back, covering his chest with his arms.</p>
<p>“Ah, that makes sense.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the conversation between Aileen and the demon seemed to finally reach an end.</p>
<p>“So you promise not to tell anyone about our fortress?”</p>
<p>—Of course.</p>
<p>“We just want to kill Orden.”</p>
<p>—Sure. I don’t know who that is, but we can help you achieve your goal! As long as you have DP!</p>
<p>“Whatever. Hey, everyone, come on out!”</p>
<p>Aileen’s voice rang out.</p>
<p>All 177 members of the Special Task Force stepped outside their tents.</p>
<p>“We’re going to start training!”</p>
<p>With a shout, Aileen took out the [Training Simulator]. The device had been updated to reflect Rumi’s report of Orden’s Palace. It was now more realistic and precise.</p>
<p>“I want to lay this out to all of you. The mission start date is not going to change! We strike three weeks from now, just like we planned! We’re going to go kill Orden!”</p>
<p>Aileen’s high-pitched voice resounded throughout the underground cave.</p>
<p>“Furthermore!”</p>
<p>This was still not set in stone. The Association had told Aileen that they would ‘try and negotiate’, but Aileen decided to announce it to the members to lift morale.</p>
<p>“Black Lotus will be joining us on this mission!”</p>
<p>Thankfully the members took the news well.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak widened his eyes in surprise. Chae Nayun nodded in seriousness, Kim Suho recalled Black Lotus with tension, and Yi Jiyoon hoped to finally take a selfie with Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“…Unni, is that true? I thought the negotiation was ongoing.”</p>
<p>The only person who knew the truth—Yun Seung-Ah—approached Aileen and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>“…I heard that the cost of the negotiations is really high…. There are rumors that the down payment is 50 billion won.”</p>
<p>“Whatever, that’s the old geezer’s problem. We need Black Lotus to end Orden for good.”</p>
<p>Aileen declared indomitably despite Yun Seung-Ah’s concern before beginning their training routine.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Demon Town in Central Asia]</p>
<p>I returned to the demon town after hunting exactly 100 demonic beasts with Boss and Wicked (she insisted on following us). Currently, Demon Realm Transformation was only 3% complete, and demonic beasts were only as strong as intermediate-rank monsters.</p>
<p>Kuong greeted us when we returned.</p>
<p>“I’ve got 1000 DP, so give me 50 lottery tickets.”</p>
<p>—Ah. We don’t sell them here.</p>
<p>With a smile, Kuong led us to the general store just around the corner.</p>
<p>—Welcome~ Come in~</p>
<p>I was the first to enter the store.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of cool stuff inside, and the shop owner was a giant who was as big as Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>I approached the shop owner and spoke.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>—Nice to meet you. I’m Deong.</p>
<p>“Do all of your names end in ‘ong’?”</p>
<p>—That’s right.</p>
<p>“…Oh. Well, I’ll cut to the chase. Give me 50 lottery tickets.”</p>
<p>—You won’t win. It’s a 1 in 30 million chance. Humans never win.</p>
<p>For some reason, Deong didn’t seem to want to sell us the lottery tickets.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you that my luck is beyond human. Just give me the tickets.”</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Deong gave me a discontented look, but I kept glaring at him and he eventually gave in. He handed me 50 tickets.</p>
<p>—It’s not gonna work.</p>
<p>I scratched the 50 lottery tickets on the spot.</p>
<p>The first ticket was 6th place. 100 DP.</p>
<p>The second ticket was nothing.</p>
<p>The third was 6th place again. 100 DP.</p>
<p>Boss widened her eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, it comes out pretty often for a 1 in a 30 million chance.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Oh. He meant that it’s 1 in a 30 million chance for first place. Everything else has a higher probability.”</p>
<p>“Uh… I see. K-Kuhum. I’ve never bought a lottery ticket before.”</p>
<p>Boss let out a dry cough in embarrassment.</p>
<p>I continued with the lottery scratching.</p>
<p>The fourth ticket was 5th place. 500 DP.</p>
<p>The fifth ticket was 3rd place. 15000 DP.</p>
<p>—Wow! You won the third place! Congratulations!</p>
<p>—3rd place? That’s something.</p>
<p>“Oh. You’re pretty lucky.”</p>
<p>Kuong, Deong, and Wicked congratulated me but I still wasn’t satisfied. I scratched the reaming tickets. 15th, 23rd, 33rd, 50th…. Although I didn’t win first place from the first 50 tickets, I bought another set of 150 tickets with the DP I won from the lottery.</p>
<p>I started at it again. 69th, 75th, 83rd…. And when I finally reached the 109th lottery ticket.</p>
<p>I saw a golden glimmer at the tip of my fingers.</p>
<p>“Ah. This one’s first place.”</p>
<p>It was a very familiar feeling, so I scratched the ticket with confidence.</p>
<p>[First Place]</p>
<p>The result was exactly what I expected.</p>
<p>With a smirk, I shoved the first place ticket at Deong.</p>
<p>“You see? Now give me that DP.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Seoul, Korea]</p>
<p>…10 days had passed since the ‘Demonic Meteor Shower Incident’.</p>
<p>Humanity quickly adapted to the sudden change.</p>
<p>When the initial confusion settled down, the difference between ‘demon merchants’ and ‘demons’ was defined, and Heroes began purchasing useful weapons from demon merchants to hunt monsters and demonic beasts more easily.</p>
<p>Also, starting last week, articles about ‘Black Lotus’ started to increase in number. I didn’t know why, but since they were more or less worshipping Black Lotus, I just decided to let them be.</p>
<p>It was probably the work of my ‘luck’.</p>
<p>“…When is she coming?”</p>
<p>Currently, I was in Seoul waiting for Yoo Yeonha to arrive. Today was the day I was scheduled to meet Oh Jaejin, a member of the Nine Stars.</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin’s original setting was made of two simple sentences: ‘The only magician among the Nine Stars’, ‘The only 10-star magician in the world’.</p>
<p>‘What should I talk about with Oh Jaejin today?… Does he know about demon merchants and DP?’</p>
<p>“Ah, here she comes.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a limousine covered in bullet-proof material appeared in the distance.</p>
<p>“Hey, over here….”</p>
<p>I waved my hand at the limousine from the sidewalk. But, <em>chweek—</em> the limousine passed by me coldly.</p>
<p>“What the.”</p>
<p>‘Was that on purpose? Or did I make a mistake?’ I asked myself, confused.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—</em></p>
<p>A gust of wind blew past me.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Then, the Dwarven Supercar I gave to Yoo Yeonha appeared beyond the wind.</p>
<p>“Phew.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was sitting on the seat of the snowmobile with a helmet on.</p>
<p>“Oh~ You look nice today.”</p>
<p>I smiled, and Yoo Yeonha took her helmet off.</p>
<p>Her long hair fluttered in the air, and for some reason, she was frowning. She glared at me with a dissatisfied, annoyed, vicious look.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha tapped on the seat behind her, her expression unchanged.</p>
<p>“…What’s with the face?”</p>
<p>“Just get on. I have a lot of questions for you but we won’t be able to meet Oh Jaejin if we’re late.”</p>
<p>“Mm? O-Okay. Sure.”</p>
<p>I got on the seat behind Yoo Yeonha. She grabbed the handlebars and pushed down on the accelerator. It only took the Dwarven Supercar 0.3 seconds to start. On the seat of a vehicle moving at 500 kilometers per hour, I asked Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Why can’t we meet him if we’re late?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that we can’t meet him. It’s more like we won’t be able to have a conversation with him.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah? What’s his side-effect?”</p>
<p>I was unsure since I hadn’t gone into a lot of details about him in the setting.</p>
<p>“Dementia.”</p>
<p>“Aha…? …What?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha leered at me and answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“His side-effect is dementia.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 284. Clouds of War (1)</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha and I arrived in North Pyeongan Province. Back when I was still in Cube, North Pyeongan Province was still an abandoned land due to the number of monsters in the area and its arid land. Another reason was that it was close to Manchuria, which was filled with barbaric Djinns.</p>
<p>“…A lot has changed, huh.”</p>
<p>But now, North Pyeongan Province was completely different from before. It was as if I was on a completely different part of Earth. Although buildings weren’t built tall due to potential monster attacks, magic engineering techniques had turned the place into a high-tech city.</p>
<p>AI machines ran around the streets, and I could see soldiers carrying ‘magic lasers’ rather than guns.</p>
<p>“You told me to invest in abandoned land, so that’s what I did. Immigrants will flock here soon.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke curtly.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah… I did say that, huh.”</p>
<p>I scratched my cheek awkwardly. I did text her about a few business ideas, but I never expected the proud Yoo Yeonha to go through with it. Maybe this was thanks to my luck too.</p>
<p>“I guess there are a lot of foreigners.”</p>
<p>Most of the people walking about were foreigners. People from all over the world had gathered here, perhaps because their home country was too dangerous or because they simply admired Korea.</p>
<p>“100% of the land here belongs to me. It’s not just North Pyeongan Province. North Hamgyeong Province, Chagang Province, and Yanggang Province, which were all abandoned during Outcall, were reclaimed by Essence of the Strait.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Good job.”</p>
<p>“North Hamgyeong Province and North Pyeongan Province went through the biggest change. In addition to residential buildings, they now even have schools, academies, Hunter’s associations, among others. They still can’t be compared to Seoul, but about 2 million immigrants live there now. As you can see, we’re doing our best to contribute to society.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, that’s great.”</p>
<p>I walked as I listened to Yoo Yeonha’s self-praise. Walking past immigrants who were speaking Korean, we arrived in front of a hospital surrounded by a magic barrier.</p>
<p>A nurse was waiting for us led us inside. We followed her past an empty hallway into an elevator.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha pressed basement 6F.</p>
<p>With a ding, the elevator door opened.</p>
<p>“…Are we in the 70s?”</p>
<p>The 6th basement floor of the hospital was built like a residential area. It almost looked like we traveled back in time through the elevator, as houses were built in traditional style with old TVs and even rotary phones.</p>
<p>Seeing that I was confused, Yoo Yeonha explained.</p>
<p>“They built it like this on purpose so that Nine Stars Oh Jaejin-nim doesn’t go berserk. He was living in hiding in an old village on Jeju Island. This floor is a replica of the village.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>I imagined the damage a 10-star magician could cause. It was undoubtedly best to eliminate anything that could provoke him.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>We entered a large house. Yoo Yeonha took off her shoes and stood in front of the sliding door of the house’s main room. I followed after her.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha knocked, and a reply immediately sounded.</p>
<p>—Come in.</p>
<p>The aged voice was that of a woman’s.</p>
<p>“Excuse us.”</p>
<p>I walked into the room with Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>The warm, rural look of the room reminded me of my grandparents’ house. Inside, a husband and wife pair were looking at us.</p>
<p>“…Hello, I’m Yoo Yeonha. This person is Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>We both bowed. The old couple greeted us with smiles.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you both. My name is Yi Yoon-Ok. Dear, you should say hi too.”</p>
<p>“…I’m Oh Jaejin.”</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin replied briefly.</p>
<p>He seemed cold and sharp and was exactly what I imagined a magician would look like with his long beard and long hair.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Since I don’t have much time, let’s cut to the chase. I hear you have a way of curing my side-effect?”</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin went straight to the point.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s possible.”</p>
<p>Hearing my confident reply, Yi Yoon-Ok’s face brightened. But Oh Jaejin didn’t say anything. He stared at me and blinked a few times. Then, he turned to his wife.</p>
<p>He spoke, “…Mom, I’m hungry~”</p>
<p>“Ah… there he goes again. Don’t worry, just tell me and I’ll relay the information to him later.”</p>
<p>“I’m hungry~ I’m hungry~ I’m hungry~!”</p>
<p>The old Gandalf began to throw a tantrum.</p>
<p>“I’m hungreeeeeey~!”</p>
<p>I was a bit caught off guard, but I didn’t panic and took out the ingredients I brought along with a mortar.</p>
<p>“Shamrock plant, Otoren, pure light plant, essence of emerald, and Minotaur’s horn. They’re all medicinal ingredients from the Tower of Wish.”</p>
<p>“I’ll eat them!”</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin quickly tried to snatch the ingredients away, but I put them in a mortar before he could get his hands on them.</p>
<p>With my astonishing dexterity and Stigma’s magic power, I crushed the ingredients and forged them into a pill. Yi Yoon-Ok, Yoo Yeonha, and Oh Jaejin all observed my godly pill-making skills in a daze.</p>
<p>Soon, a total of five pills came out.</p>
<p>[Miracle Pill]</p>
<p>The pills came with various effects, but I erased most of them with ‘Setting Intervention’ and added ‘Dementia Side-effect Reversal’ as their only effect.</p>
<p>Each pill took 70SP to make, and the ingredients cost 100,000TP altogether.</p>
<p>350SP and 100,000TP were not cheap, but it wasn’t expensive if I could win over Oh Jaejin.</p>
<p>“These pills with cure Nine Stars Oh Jaejin-nim’s side-effect.”</p>
<p>Yi Yoon-Ok looked at the pills in my hand with a shocked look.</p>
<p>“But I would like you to promise me something.”</p>
<p>One pill every two weeks.</p>
<p>“Once he is cured, he has to help humanity.”</p>
<p>When I handed the pills to Yi Yoon-Ok, she nodded firmly.</p>
<p>“Of course, even if I stop him, he will want to do so more than anyone else. My husband is the most heroic Hero I know.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Yi Yoon-Ok had great trust in her husband.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke as soon as we left the hospital.</p>
<p>“…That went better than I expected.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>We didn’t need to convince them much.</p>
<p>In a way, it was to be expected. The Nine Stars were Heroes chosen by the people based on their strength and character.</p>
<p>The only thing stopping them from helping humanity was the side-effect of their abilities. As long as that problem was settled, most of the Nine Stars should be happy to help.</p>
<p>“…By the way, do you know about this?”</p>
<p>It seemed Yoo Yeonha still had more to say.</p>
<p>“This is top-secret info, but I hear Black Lotus helped the Hero Association with their Orden Mission.”</p>
<p>Black Lotus. The words made me flinch every time I heard it, but I nodded leisurely.</p>
<p>“That’s interesting.”</p>
<p>“Right, so… are you not going to participate?”</p>
<p>“Me? I care about my life. What if Black Lotus kills me?”</p>
<p>“Pft… Right, you did kill Black Lotus in the Tower. I guess you brought it upon yourself then.”</p>
<p>Oblivious to the truth, Yoo Yeonha giggled.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, you really are amazing.”</p>
<p>“…Thanks. And by the way…”</p>
<p>Thinking that the conversation would become harder to navigate, I quickly changed the topic.</p>
<p>“What are you up to these days?”</p>
<p>“Busy as always. Even busier, actually.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“You know, with the demon towns and demon merchants that suddenly appeared… I have to think of ways to get DP.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with DP?”</p>
<p>This was an important question. I wasn’t sure how to use the 1.8 million DP I got through the lottery. I was sure Yoo Yeonha would give me a good idea.</p>
<p>“A lot. Buying artifacts from other dimensions are one, but what’s even more important is DP being an instant currency. If you want a building, you can buy it. If you want gold, you can buy it. If you want a weapon, you can buy it. You can build an entire city in 3 seconds if you have enough DP.”</p>
<p>“Mm, I see.”</p>
<p>“DP can become anything, making it revolutionary. We will no longer have to wait for a project to finish or for research to be over.”</p>
<p>“Aha….”</p>
<p>I nodded and took out the [Anything Checkbook].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Anything Checkbook] [8-star] ＊Effective Good＊</p>
<p>—A checkbook that can pay out anything. The receiver of this check must also carry out what he was paid for.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I wrote down 1 million DP and gave the check to Yoo Yeonha who was staring at me weirdly.</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”</p>
<p>“1 million DP.”</p>
<p>“…Come again?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha took the check with a bewildered look.</p>
<p>“You’ll have a million won when everyone else has a thousand. You should be able to control the market with this, right?”</p>
<p>“Um, what is this again?”</p>
<p>“It’s a check for DP. Just tear it, and you’ll get 1 million DP.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha grumbled as she tore the check in half. My DP fell into her hands immediately as I was left with only 800,000 DP.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s eyes popped out about 2 meters into the air. She looked even more surprised than when she found out that I was alive.</p>
<p>“W-What’s this?”</p>
<p>I grinned seeing the flustered Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“1 million DP. I’m investing it, not giving it away for free, so use it to drive the market. You can do whatever you want with it, but half of what you achieve is going to be mine, okay?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s obvious, but how did you make a million DP? Hunting demonic beasts shouldn’t be enough to….”</p>
<p>‘No, wait, am I dreaming?’ Yoo Yeonha shook her head and slapped her cheeks. She snapped out only after her cheeks turned red.</p>
<p>“Wow… hehe, hehehe.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled brightly after realizing she wasn’t dreaming.</p>
<p>It was an ambitionist’s smile stemming from pure bliss of being able to get ahead of her competitors.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…On the other hand, a meeting was underway within the Hero Association. In truth, it was more of a debate than a meeting. Only three people were present as well.</p>
<p>“I hear Heynckes has returned.”</p>
<p>The current chairman of the Hero Association, Yi Yookho, spoke. His bald head shined brightly under the room’s light.</p>
<p>“What do you think? Chae Joochul and Heynckes should be able to kill Orden if they work together.”</p>
<p>The man who responded was the former president of Korea, Kim Sukho.</p>
<p>“It’s not impossible, but I don’t think Chae Joochul would be willing to take any loss….”</p>
<p>“With Black Lotus and Kim Suho, it should be easier.”</p>
<p>Black Lotus.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho flinched when he heard Yi Yookho mention this name.</p>
<p>He had even hired Mountain Sage to assassinate him, but Black Lotus survived, while he lost contact with them. It was clear what that entailed.</p>
<p>As such, Kim Sukho wasn’t fond of Black Lotus.</p>
<p>At that moment, the third member of the meeting spoke up.</p>
<p>“But Black Lotus is too expensive. Accepting the price they put out would put the association in a deep hole.” The third member brought up a financial concern. “They’re skilled, yes, but they’re also too expensive. Those dogs don’t know what they’re worth.”</p>
<p>Yi Yookho retorted, “It’s better than losing to Orden. Didn’t you see the decree that arrogant fool sent? Plus, feeding your hunting dog isn’t a waste. The tougher it is, the more you have to feed.”</p>
<p>This week, Orden had threatened the Hero Association and various countries with an official decree. He said he would declare war if his decree was not released to the public.</p>
<p>The third member nodded in response to Yi Yookho, “…Then I guess we have no choice.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho stared at the third member with a look of expectation.</p>
<p>If each of them had 33% of authority over the Association, the final 1% likely belonged to the third member as not only did he possess authority but also ‘strength’.</p>
<p>“We’ll just have to put down the dog after the hunt is over.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho liked what he was hearing.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Next day.</p>
<p>I returned to Pandemonium and put on my Black Lotus Uniform. It was confirmed that the Chameleon Troupe would participate in the Orden Assassination Mission.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?” Boss asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“Oh~ Black really does look good on you.” Cheok Jungyeong commented from the side.</p>
<p>I shrugged and asked, “What happened to the assassins? Did you find out who was behind them?”</p>
<p>“No, they wouldn’t spit it out no matter what we did.”</p>
<p>“Mm… well, that’s to be expected from Mountain Sage. What about Jin Sahyuk?”</p>
<p>“She’s still imprisoned. She’s a tough one too. We sent Droon to her expecting her to get a bit scared, but she got even feistier.”</p>
<p>Droon’s Mimyo had multiple abilities. One of them was an illusion spell called ‘Illusory Death’, which was specialized for torture. But it probably didn’t work on Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“She even withstood the Banshee’s Curse, so it’ll be hard to crack her.”</p>
<p>If anything, her endurance was top-notch. Anything less than the Banshee’s Curse probably wouldn’t leave a dent in her mental strength.</p>
<p>“Mm, I see… Oi, you guys, get over here!” Cheok Jungyeong suddenly shouted.</p>
<p>Then, the slow-moving members of the Chameleon Troupe quickly arrived.</p>
<p>“Geez, stop being so loud. It’s unsightly.” Setryn muttered. “You don’t need to roar for us to hear you either.”</p>
<p>Following her, Khalifa, Jin Yohan, Droon, Jain, and Kaita (who managed to not die) arrived. Eight of us, including me and Boss, would participate in today’s mission.</p>
<p>“Quiet. Now that everyone’s here, open the portal, Khalifa.”</p>
<p>Khalifa opened the portal at Boss’ command.</p>
<p>An oval portal appeared in the air, and burning heat blew out from inside.</p>
<p>The moment we all stepped into the portal, an emergency sound rang out from my smartwatch.</p>
<p>—Emergency news. The Monster King, Orden, sent a video to news agencies all over the world along with a decree. He has threatened to declare war if the decree is not released to the public. As such, after careful consideration, the government has decided to release the decree…</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Same time, immediately after members of the Chameleon Troupe left for Africa.</p>
<p>“…Huu, huu.”</p>
<p><em>Click—!</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk barely managed to remove the magic power suppressors on her wrists. Her body was drenched in sweat as she breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Ehew….”</p>
<p>It was thanks to the two stats, Nonobservance and Distortion, she gained after the recent incident.</p>
<p>[Nonobservance] allowed her to ignore some of the magic power suppressors power, and [Distortion] strengthened the power of her Reality Manipulation.</p>
<p>“Bastards, just you wait….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk staggered up. Although she was trapped in the Chameleon Troupe’s jail cell for a long time, she had still heard about the changes that happened outside.</p>
<p>Demon Realm Transformation and demon merchants.</p>
<p>Things had progressed as Bell foretold, so the next situation would be the descent of Baal.</p>
<p>In other words, it wouldn’t be long until she could return to Akatrina.</p>
<p>“Huu, huu…”</p>
<p>After collecting her breath and recharging her magic power, Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes and transmitted her will.</p>
<p>—Bell, you son of a bitch, where are you?</p>
<p>Although she wasn’t too familiar with using Mental Transmission, her sheer talent gave her more than enough edge.</p>
<p>—Oh? You got released, Sahyuk~?</p>
<p>—Shut it. Where are you?</p>
<p>—I’m with Rumi in an underground fortress.</p>
<p>—Underground fortress?</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned. ‘What the hell happened while I was imprisoned here?’</p>
<p>—It’s an advance base built in subterranean Africa. It’s to kill Orden. Kim Suho’s here too.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>‘I missed out on so much fun!’ Jin Sahyuk frowned.</p>
<p>—I’m heading over too.</p>
<p>—Mm? No, you can’t. Kim Suho will find out if you do. Plus, something urgent just happened.</p>
<p>—What.</p>
<p>—Orden wants to talk to the public.</p>
<p>‘Talk to the public? The hell does that mean?’ Jin Sahyuk wanted to ask, but she wasn’t familiar with the Mental Transmission technique and got a headache. As such, she made a portal. Her first goal was to escape from this damned prison.</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>But thinking about it a second time, leaving this place seemed like a bad idea. Her relationship with the Chameleon Troupe would end if she left. Perhaps it was better to stay here for Kim Hajin…</p>
<p>At that moment, a lightbulb lit up in her head.</p>
<p>“Oh right.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk materialized the ‘inventory’ she made with Reality Manipulation and took out a card from it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Body Double] [6-star] ＊Effective Good＊</p>
<p>—Creates a puppet that looks and acts like you. (Ignition Keyword – ‘Actualize’)</p>
<p>—The puppet will last for 150 days, and you can switch places with the puppet at any time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Actualize.”</p>
<p>The moment she muttered the ignition keyword, a puppet identical to Jin Sahyuk popped out. Jin Sahyuk put the magic power suppressors on the puppet and gave it a command.</p>
<p>“Act like me as much as possible. Go crazy.”</p>
<p>The puppet stared at Jin Sahyuk blankly before nodding.</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>With a satisfied smile, Jin Sahyuk went through the portal.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 285. Clouds of War (2)</p>
<p>[Underground Fortress in Africa]</p>
<p>“He’s planning on building a nation.”</p>
<p>This was Rumi’s last testimony as the spy.</p>
<p>“…A nation?”</p>
<p>Aileen and Jin Seyeon, who were writing down Rumi’s words, tilted their heads in confusion.</p>
<p>“Yes. He’s already built a number of villages in Africa. Didn’t you say there were missing people after the recent monster incident?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yeah, I did, but… that can’t be right.”</p>
<p>Rumi drank a sip of cold water and sighed.</p>
<p>“…Your guess is correct. Orden probably forced those missing people to migrate into the villages he built. Your drones weren’t able to detect it because his hypervigilant monster birds destroyed them beforehand.”</p>
<p>What Rumi was saying made sense. The government had dispatched a thousand drones to Africa but 990 of them had already been destroyed. They had to utilize the remaining 10 to plan a safe route.</p>
<p>But the fact that Orden kept humans alive and even built them a place to live was difficult to believe.</p>
<p>Rumi continued, “Trust me. I’ve seen his papers. I was in charge of assigning categories.”</p>
<p>“Categories?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I ranked monsters and villages.”</p>
<p>Rumi recited the ‘settings’ of Orden’s Kingdom. All monsters were assigned a category among Sacred Bone and True Bone, rank-1 to rank-9. Similarly. All villages were assigned a rank of either low, middle, and upper.</p>
<p>“…So you’re saying there really are villages.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. They’re human villages run by monsters. Orden chose this method because he knew there weren’t enough humanoid monsters compared to humans. But among Orden’s monsters are scientists who are researching ways to turn the kidnapped humans into monsters.”</p>
<p>When the conversation reached that point, Aileen was frowning like a dwarf in agony. Yi Gongmyung’s face on her laptop screen had a similar look.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung spoke.</p>
<p>—…We’ll hear about the details from the others.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Aileen and Jin Seyeon both seemed confused.</p>
<p>‘Is he trying to say that there are other spies besides Rumi?’ they wondered.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘others’?”</p>
<p>—Oh, I received this news just now.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung let out a sigh of relief and relayed the message he had just received from his superiors.</p>
<p>—Apparently Black Lotus and the rest of the Chameleon Troupe are participating in this mission. They’re traveling by land, so if there really are villages, then they’ll be the first to run into them.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>We arrived in Africa. At first, we couldn’t help but wonder if we arrived at the wrong place. A lot had changed since the last time we visited.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a village~?”</p>
<p>Jain muttered in surprise. Other members, including me, were surprised as well.</p>
<p>“…Yes, that seems to be a village.”</p>
<p>It sufficed to say that Africa had also went through a ‘great change’. The land that once crawled with monsters had been transformed into one fit for human survival. There weren’t any tall buildings or skyscrapers that could be seen in a city. However, there were small, round buildings which were enough to create a rural scenery.</p>
<p>“Where are we exactly, Khalifa?”</p>
<p>Boss asked Khalifa.</p>
<p>“I’d say we’re on the outskirts of Orden’s Territory. We only have to travel 700 km to reach Orden’s palace.”</p>
<p>Orden would’ve noticed instantly if we had set up a portal near his palace. So, Khalifa created his portal on the outskirts of Africa. This village was erected in the middle of the shortest route to Orden’s palace.</p>
<p>“But those villagers aren’t monsters.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong narrowed his eyes and peered into the distance, tilting his head sideways.</p>
<p>“You’re right. They’re all humans.”</p>
<p>Because I had better eyesight than him, I had noticed that the second we arrived here. All the villagers were humans. Not monsters but pure humans.</p>
<p>“Ah~ I heard that the number of missing people skyrocketed after the recent monster incident~ So this is where he brought all those people~ By the looks of it, he even brainwashed them a little~ How interesting~”</p>
<p>Jain chuckled.</p>
<p>The Middle East and Western Europe were still infested with monsters, yet the number of missing people were much higher than the number of casualties. It made sense for the village to be this big if we assumed that those missing people were kidnapped rather than killed.</p>
<p>“Hmm. Well, let’s see what Orden has to say first.”</p>
<p>I pulled up the live broadcast of Orden’s declaration on my smartwatch.</p>
<p>—…First, I demand humans be sent to Africa. Each country is to send two hundred million people. I promise to keep the hostages safe.</p>
<p>—Second, I demand official acknowledgment and respect of me and my servants as ‘Neohumans’. Neohumans are superior to humans. Humans should be grateful that we’re not choosing to eliminate them or rule over them forcefully.</p>
<p>Orden’s demands were quite absurd. No country would ever agree to hand over two hundred million citizens to any entity, much less a hostile one.</p>
<p>—…As a tolerant ruler, I am willing to offer the humans a grace period of 6 months.</p>
<p>“That’s enough crap for a day. It seems that Orden built this village.”</p>
<p>I turned the smartwatch off and looked at the members of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>They were all looking at me.</p>
<p>“Well… Why don’t we build an outpost for ourselves first? Like that underground fortress, the Special Task Force built.”</p>
<p>“Outpost~?”</p>
<p>Jain tilted her head questioningly.</p>
<p>“Yes. This mission will probably take a while.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we just use that village as the outpost?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong suggested.</p>
<p>“Mm, that sounds like a good idea.”</p>
<p>“So I guess even a bonehead like you can be useful once in a while~”</p>
<p>Not only Jin Yohan and Setryn but also Jain agreed.</p>
<p>“Uh….”</p>
<p>“Why are you hesitating? We could wipe that place out in a second.”</p>
<p>It was then that I realized the true strength of our party.</p>
<p>In fact, Cheok Jungyeong and Boss alone would be enough to overwhelm most humanoid monsters.</p>
<p>“…Okay, then.”</p>
<p>With a smile, I raised a finger and pointed to the center of the village.</p>
<p>“How about that castle over there? Seems like a place where the village lord would live.”</p>
<p>The castle wasn’t enormous but it was taller than all the other buildings around it.</p>
<p>“Good. Let’s head there.”</p>
<p>At Boss’s declaration, we moved like the wind.</p>
<p>[‘Crean’, a low-rank village located in the far south corner of Orden’s Kingdom]</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>‘Tenzuhar’ was the name of the humanoid monster selected to become the lord of Crean. He was small and looked like a lizard. He was selected as the lord because he was an eloquent speaker and possessed a rare ability called ‘Brainwash’.</p>
<p>It was also because stronger humanoid monsters preferred to stay in the central palace rather than rule over humans.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar pondered, shaking his leg. ‘How can I win Orden’s affection and acquire fame and fortune? I can’t possibly satiate my thirst for ambition on the outskirts of a hot country like this.’</p>
<p>“Surely improving the village won’t be enough. <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>Only humans resided in Crean. Villages located deeper into the mainland had at least some monster residents. But he’d have to be at least rank-1 to be able to take over villages like that.</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp.</em> Even if I dig the mines, all the ores end up flowing into middle or upper-rank villages….”</p>
<p>Crean was a low-rank mining village.</p>
<p>“But if I don’t produce anything, I’ll only end up getting punished. <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>Premian, the most delicate magic ore on Earth.</p>
<p>A large amount of Premian was buried in Crean and that was why all the villagers were humans. With monsters’ sharp claws, they would crush Premian into dust before even digging them out completely.</p>
<p>“There’s no opportunity for me to stand out…. <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar smacked his lips.</p>
<p>Most small humanoid monsters possessed a great desire to succeed. It was a genetic predisposition, granted to them as compensation as they weren’t as strong as other monsters.</p>
<p>Tenzuhar was no different. He was dissatisfied with the village he was in charge of, even though Crean was far too good for him.</p>
<p>“Darn it. Guard!”</p>
<p>Irritated, Tenzuhar called in a guard to gratify his hunger.</p>
<p>—Krrrk!</p>
<p>Tenzuhar’s guard was a rank-4 monster who lacked the ability to speak or to think complex thoughts. He was assigned rank-4 only because he was strong. Strong enough to win against a high-rank grade-3 Hero.</p>
<p>“Give me something to eat!”</p>
<p>—Krrk!</p>
<p>The guard nodded his head and left.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>The criteria for classifying monsters had been developed only recently. Most monsters were assigned into a class between rank-1 and rank-9. Only a select few could become a ‘True Bone’ or a ‘Sacred Bone’.</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp.</em> What can I do with underlings who can’t even speak?”</p>
<p>In fact, the primary criterion for classifying a monster was its ability to speak. If you couldn’t speak properly, you were rank-2 at best. The second most important criteria considered strength, intelligence, and special ability.</p>
<p>Tenzuhar was a rank-3 humanoid monster. He was weak but could speak fluently. His ability was decent and his intelligence was above human average.</p>
<p><em>Crash—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, he heard a ruckus downstairs.</p>
<p>Tenzuhar got up from his seat, full of anger.</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp!</em> He can’t even do something as simple as bringing me food! <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>He stomped towards the door to go give his guard a scolding.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em> The door opened.</p>
<p>No, somebody opened the door.</p>
<p>Confused, Tenzuhar looked at the human beyond the gap.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>The human was huge. His muscles were the size of his head and his legs were as thick as his waist.</p>
<p>‘Did I have a resident who looks like that?’ Tenzuhar pondered.</p>
<p>Suddenly, <em>ssk—</em></p>
<p>A sharp blade reached Tenzuhar’s neck. The humanoid monster gasped at the sudden coldness.</p>
<p>“Quiet.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar glanced at the enemy behind him.</p>
<p>He couldn’t see the intruder’s face, but Tenzuhar noticed that he was wearing a black robe with a lotus embroidery.</p>
<p>‘Black Lotus.’</p>
<p>His symbol was well known among Orden’s monsters as well. Tenzuhar started to drool in fear.</p>
<p>“…Do you have anything to say?”</p>
<p>Black Lotus asked.</p>
<p>Under overwhelming pressure and fear, Tenzuhar answered.</p>
<p>“Spare me…. I know nothing. <em>Slurrrp. Slurp, slurp. Slurrrrp….</em>”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar began to roll his tongue rapidly and soon lost consciousness when he choked on his own tongue. Kim Hajin looked at his stats.</p>
<p>[Life force 33/100]</p>
<p>[Name — Tenzuhar]</p>
<p>[Alignment — Misdemeanors / Ambitionist]</p>
<p>[Realm — Stage-1 Average]</p>
<p>[Potential — Stage-3 Average]</p>
<p>[Job — Low-rank Administrator]</p>
<p>[Status — Unconscious from fear]</p>
<p>[Special Ability — Low-intermediate-rank Brainwash]</p>
<p>[Potential to coax — Surprisingly high]</p>
<p>He didn’t have the ability to call for help remotely.</p>
<p>There was no reason to kill him, so Kim Hajin threw him on the floor.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>We easily took over the castle. I tied Tenzuhar up with a rope and hung him upside down. Then, I settled on a nearby sofa.</p>
<p>“Hm. The view is surprisingly beautiful from here.”</p>
<p>“So now that the outpost is taken care of….”</p>
<p>Boss looked outside the window and Jain muttered with a map in her hands.</p>
<p>“There are only four villages from here to Orden’s Palace.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Tenzuhar opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Huuak!”</p>
<p>“Eh? What the. You didn’t kill this guy, Lotus~?”</p>
<p>“No. I thought maybe we could use him later on.”</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp.</em> Please spare me. Spare me, <em>slurp. Slurrrp….</em>”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar fainted again soon after opening his eyes.</p>
<p>‘What a strange monster.’</p>
<p>I ignored him and summoned a demon merchant.</p>
<p>[You spent 1000 DP to summon the demon merchant ‘Kuong’.]</p>
<p>—Nice to see you! I’m the visiting demon merchant, Kuong!</p>
<p>Kuong, the only ‘neutral’ demon merchant I’d seen, appeared before us. He beamed at me.</p>
<p>“I need a communication device that I can use to contact the underground fortress. Do you have anything like that?”</p>
<p>—Yes, of course~ One for you and one for the fortress. That’ll be 1250 DP including the delivery fee.</p>
<p>When I paid him the 1250 DP through the System, Kuong handed me a black handheld transceiver.</p>
<p>—Thank you. Is there anything else?</p>
<p>“Uh… Maybe?“</p>
<p>The demon merchant system turned out to be more useful than I thought. The fact that they were willing to do anything for me as long as I paid them was very convenient, just like Yoo Yeonha said.</p>
<p>I stroked my chin as I spoke.</p>
<p>“…Hey.”</p>
<p>—Yes?</p>
<p>“Is there a way to, um, make DP without doing anything?</p>
<p>—You already did, with the lottery!</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true. But you said that the number of first place tickets is fixed. And it’s pretty tiring to scratch all those tickets.”</p>
<p>DP lottery was divided into different rounds and there were only 10 first place tickets in a round. So, as the number of first place tickets decreased, the chance of winning decreased as well. And there was no way for me to know if all the first place tickets had already been picked, especially considering that this lottery happened in multiple dimensions like the demon merchant said.</p>
<p>—Mmm~ Then, would you like to try the minigame?</p>
<p>“Minigame?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Lotus~ Are you having fun with the merchant~?”</p>
<p>Jain suddenly intervened, and I pushed her away.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>—Please look over here.</p>
<p>Kuong spread his palms and, all of sudden, a video popped up.</p>
<p>[A dimension within a dimension. Your DP donation can save other subdimensions.]</p>
<p>It sounded like a line from a public service advertisement.</p>
<p>After about 5 seconds, a sphere appeared above Kuong’s palms.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>—Similar to the lottery, this is a game of luck. This planet is called ‘Lailos’. It’s a subdimension of Earth.</p>
<p>“Subdimension?”</p>
<p>—Yes, it’s a dimension that’s lower in rank than Earth. The difference between Earth and Lailos is kind of like the difference between ‘reality’ and a ‘novel’.</p>
<p>“…Why would you compare it to a novel of all things?”</p>
<p>—It’s just an example. Anyways, look here.</p>
<p>Kuong shook his hand to zoom in on ‘Lailos’. The sphere transformed into a plot of land. A group of knights were standing there.</p>
<p>Kuong spoke.</p>
<p>—’Lailos’ is also fighting against Demon Realm Transformation. You, a being from a higher dimension, can help the people of Lailos.</p>
<p>“Why would I help them? I’m busy taking care of myself.”</p>
<p>—By sponsoring a person, you can earn DP every time the person you sponsor kills a demonic beast.</p>
<p>“…Hmm. Really?”</p>
<p>I looked closely at the knights.</p>
<p>‘One, two, one, two—!’</p>
<p>Hundreds of tiny knights were training hard.</p>
<p>‘You won’t kill a single demonic beast if that’s all you’re capable of!’</p>
<p>Even the superior knight’s scolding sounded cute.</p>
<p>—Why don’t you give it a try? But be careful! You can only sponsor up to three people. It’s usually one, but you get two extra because you have 5 stats! Anyways, you should try to pick someone with high potential.</p>
<p>“Ah~ So that’s why you said this was similar to the lottery.”</p>
<p>—That’s right! You should pick the strongest and the most diligent one! Time also flows quicker in this dimension. A year in Lailos is 30 days in this world. You’re going to be sitting on a mountain of DP soon!</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>The conditions were extremely advantageous for me.</p>
<p>I didn’t even have to use my luck.</p>
<p>I looked over the knights one by one and began gauging their potential. It didn’t matter how strong they were right now. I focused on their ‘potential’.</p>
<p>One knight had a potential of [Stage-3 Average], the other was [Stage-4 Rare], and even the superior with the loud voice was only [Stage-5 Rare].</p>
<p>‘Does anyone here have actual talent?’</p>
<p>I carefully studied the knights.</p>
<p>“…Ah, found one.”</p>
<p>A woman was hiding behind a tree, watching the other knights train.</p>
<p>She looked young and she still had her baby fat. But the look on her face was upright and determined just like a knight should be.</p>
<p>[Life force 100/100]</p>
<p>[Name — Litrain]</p>
<p>[Alignment — Good / Ambitionist]</p>
<p>[Realm — Stage-0 Below-Average]</p>
<p>[Potential — Stage-9 Extraordinary]</p>
<p>[Job — Squire]</p>
<p>[Status — Feeling envious of her seniors]</p>
<p>[Potential to coax — Looking for a master to serve]</p>
<p>Her potential was an astounding stage-9. I wasn’t exactly sure how good that was, but I assumed it was good enough that she could grow on her own even if I left her alone.</p>
<p>I picked Litrain as my beneficiary.</p>
<p>[You have chosen to sponsor Litrain, a squire.]</p>
<p>—How much would you like to donate?</p>
<p>“100,000 DP.”</p>
<p>—Wow, you’re very generous~</p>
<p>[You have donated 100,000 DP to Litrain. Litrain has gained the feature ‘Status Window’.]</p>
<p>[Litrain will gratefully use your donation.]</p>
<p>The next moment, Litrain’s eyes widened. Unsurprisingly, she looked confused.</p>
<p>But this ‘donation’ appeared to be a well-known phenomenon in Lailos. Litrain clenched her fists and jumped up in joy.</p>
<p>—Hooray~! I was chosen-!</p>
<p>At her shout, all the other knights turned their attention to her.</p>
<p>“What’s this? She’s suddenly happy.”</p>
<p>—Ah, the people of Lailos are familiar with donations… Hmm? Something strange happened during the donation process!</p>
<p>Kuong’s eyes suddenly widened, and a number of system messages blocked my view.</p>
<p>[Your interdimensional luck activates.]</p>
<p>[As a result of your luck, Litrain’s physical ability is strengthened!]</p>
<p>[As a result of your luck, Litrain’s growth is accelerated!]</p>
<p>[You can now receive 100% of DP that Litrain earns from hunting demonic beasts.]</p>
<p>—Congratulation! This character will become very strong, very soon! You’ll be able to recover your initial donation of 100,000 DP in two months.</p>
<p>“…Mm, well this sounds great.”</p>
<p>I looked at Litrain, who was jumping up and down in joy, then turned the ‘minigame’ off.</p>
<p>“That’s done.”</p>
<p>I grabbed the transceiver I bought and turned around.</p>
<p>“Underground Fortress, can you hear me?”</p>
<p>The transceiver was connected to the underground fortress.</p>
<p>The answer came quickly.</p>
<p>—Yes, I can. This is Aileen, and you are… Lotus? I received the transceiver. So we meet again. It’s good to see you, I guess?</p>
<p>Aileen’s voice sounded cheerful as usual.</p>
<p>I spoke in Black Lotus’s usual nonchalant manner.</p>
<p>“This is Black Lotus. We have taken over one of Orden’s villages.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 286. Clouds of War (3)</p>
<p>—Village? There’s really a village in Africa?</p>
<p>Aileen’s tone went up as if in surprise.</p>
<p>I looked at the map on the village lord’s desk and said, “Yes, the village is named Crean. We just took down the lord.”</p>
<p>—What? It even has a lord?</p>
<p>“It was a humanoid monster resembling a lizard. Tenzuhar was his name.”</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Aileen became quiet for a moment, and other voices began to buzz from the other side.</p>
<p>“Ah~ It’s that kid again~?”</p>
<p>Jain grumbled unhappily. I smirked and turned the transreceiver off.</p>
<p>“I’ve been curious, Jain. How do you know Aileen?”</p>
<p>“Me? Mm~ It’s nothing special~ I used to act as a Hero in the past. She was my superior. That stupid brat is only two years older than me. I hated how she acted all important because of her Gift~”</p>
<p><em>Tzzt—</em></p>
<p>The transreceiver buzzed as soon as Jain finished her sentences.</p>
<p>—Who’s living in the village?</p>
<p>It wasn’t Aileen’s voice but Yun Seung-Ah’s. Jain, who had a bad relationship with her, frowned.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat with a cough, then replied with my voice changed to Black Lotus’s.</p>
<p>“Humans.”</p>
<p>—Are they doing okay?</p>
<p>“They’re physically healthy. It looks like they were brainwashed, but it didn’t look like they were being abused. They think of themselves as ‘miners’ who have been living here for a long time.”</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>It became silent once again.</p>
<p>Since I wasn’t hearing any static noise either, I guessed that they turned off their transceiver and started a meeting.</p>
<p>I checked the ‘minigame’ while I waited for a response.</p>
<p>「…Half a day had passed since Litrain was chosen. Many knights congratulated her, but it was obvious how much they envied her.</p>
<p>Litrain’s physical strength improved the moment she was chosen, and she received close to 130,000 points. It was clear that Litrain’s sponsor was an unprecedented magnate.</p>
<p>The knights couldn’t understand what such a rich sponsor saw in Litrain.</p>
<p>An uneducated squire who came to the capital without a plan, a country bumpkin who would only remain a baggage carrier, that was who Litrain was in their eyes.</p>
<p>No one knew whether Litrain was aware of the knights’ dissatisfaction, but she began to turn her life around. The moment she was ‘chosen’, she set up a shrine for her sponsor in her small room and prayed before every meal. Being ‘chosen’ was her dream. Now that she achieved it, her happiness knew no bounds….」</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>Things seemed to be progressing well. Though, she didn’t really need to worship me…</p>
<p>Seeing Litrain, who was praying before eating, I pondered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Buster Call] [High-rank]</p>
<p>—Using Stigma’s magic power, summon from the Tower of Wish vassals, who swore loyalty to Kim Hajin, or his possessions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My sole active-Gift, Buster Call.</p>
<p>By adding another word or two after ‘Tower of Wish’, I felt like I could use it to summon Litrain as well.</p>
<p>For example, [summon from the Tower of Wish or another dimension…]</p>
<p>“Oi, Kuong.”</p>
<p>I spoke to Kuong who was standing around silently.</p>
<p>—Yes?</p>
<p>“You said we live in a higher dimension, right?”</p>
<p>—Yes, compared to the minigame’s dimension.</p>
<p>“Then is it possible to summon a being from a lower dimension to a higher dimension?”</p>
<p>—Mm, I’m not sure since I haven’t tried. But it could be possible. Afterall, you <em>are</em> from an upper dimension.</p>
<p>“…What’s the difference between an upper dimension and a lower one?”</p>
<p>—Simply put, higher dimensions are more stable. To people from lower dimensions, beings from</p>
<p>higher dimensions are like gods.</p>
<p>‘Stable…’ I was thinking about the meaning of this word when Kuong kindly explained it.</p>
<p>—More stable dimensions have weaker humans. The most stable dimension would be one where an individual human would have the least freedom to interfere with nature.</p>
<p>It was clear what Kuong was saying.</p>
<p>But why did I think of my original world, ‘Earth’?</p>
<p>The Earth I lived in didn’t have magic, mana, magic power, martial arts, or anything of that nature.</p>
<p>Although humanity advanced technology to overcome nature, countless number of people died during the process. It was certainly the world where ‘an individual human would have the least freedom to interfere with nature.’</p>
<p>I stared at Kuong with a look of suspicion. But Kuong only grinned without saying anything.</p>
<p>“Now then—”</p>
<p><em>Tzzt—</em> At that moment, the transceiver buzzed again. Kuong also said his time was up and disappeared.</p>
<p>—This is Beetle. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>“…Beetle?”</p>
<p>—It’s a codename. What are your plans from now?</p>
<p>“…We plan on using the village lord as our pathfinder.”</p>
<p>—Pathfinder? Ah, got it. Let us know when you reach the next village. I have a meeting to attend to now.</p>
<p>With that, the transreceiver went quiet.</p>
<p>I looked at Tenzuhar, who was tied up and dangling from a rope in the ceiling. His eyes were closed as though he was unconscious, but I could see his status.</p>
<p>[Status – nervous he might be discovered.]</p>
<p>He was <em>pretending</em> to be unconscious.</p>
<p>“Open your eyes. Otherwise, I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Five, four, three….”</p>
<p>“I, I’m awake!”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar shot his eyes open before I even reached two.</p>
<p>“Oh~ He was awake~?” Jain grinned and approached him.</p>
<p>Tenzuhar made a submissive smile and rubbed his hands together. “<em>Slurp.</em> I, I just woke up… <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>“….” I left him dangling in the air and spoke, “Oi.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“…Can you act as our pathfinder?”</p>
<p>“Pathfinder?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We have to keep going.”</p>
<p>Even if I could avoid traps using my excellent eyesight, it likely couldn’t compare to a humanoid monster who had knowledge of the area.</p>
<p>“…O-Of course! <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar seemed to ponder for a moment but quickly gave an enthusiastic reply. He must have realized this was the only way he could live.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>[How have you been, Hyung-nim?]</p>
<p>A message popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>[It’s jajangman. It’s been a while ㅋㅋ ^^]</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”</p>
<p>[I stopped in TOW (Tower of Wish) to pull some cards. I’m messaging you because I pulled something interesting. ㅋㅋ Hold on, let me see if I can send you the card info.]</p>
<p>“The hell?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s voice was also transmitted along with the message. The ringing sound gave me a slight headache.</p>
<p>[ㅋㅋ Look at this ㅋㅋ I screamed the moment I pulled it ㅋㅋ It’s the first 8-star card I pulled ㅋㅋㅋ]</p>
<p>A card info popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Infinite Communication] [8-star] ＊Effective Good＊</p>
<p>—Select 55 Players for unlimited communication.</p>
<p>—Text and voice will be transmitted simultaneously. The receiver cannot reject your communication without the 7-star card, [Refuse Communication].</p>
<p>—The user of this card becomes immune to mental interference-type effects.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Hahaha, how is it, Hyung-nim? Have you pulled an 8-star card before~? Ah~ It’s been a while since I quit the Tower but pulling this makes me want to go back. I have an important mission to do too….]</p>
<p>“Geez, so loud….”</p>
<p>Wasn’t she supposed to stay in the underground fortress? Why did she go to the Tower?</p>
<p>[…Ah, oops, my bad. I put the sound up too high ;;]</p>
<p>Well, it seemed she figured it out.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s voice, which was akin to a roar, fell to the level of a whisper.</p>
<p>“Haa… haaa….”</p>
<p>[Ah, Hyung-nim, I set it so the communication is bi-directional. If there’s anything you want to say, you just have to text me.]</p>
<p>“…What kind of a card is this?”</p>
<p>How did she pull an 8-star card anyways with her luck?</p>
<p>I clenched my head and collected my breath.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, and several other Heroes returned to the underground fortress after pulling cards in the Tower of Wish’s Card Kingdom. Aileen had ordered them to do so in case they might pull something that could help their mission.</p>
<p>Kim Suho pulled an 8-star card and three 7-star cards, while Chae Nayun pulled two 8-star cards.</p>
<p>[Ah, ah, Kim Suho, can you hear me?]</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Currently, Kim Suho was suffering from Chae Nayun’s attacks.</p>
<p>[My voice isn’t loud anymore, right?]</p>
<p>“Oh yeah.”</p>
<p>[ㅋㅋIsn’t this card amazing?]</p>
<p>Kim Suho sighed and replied, “It is.”</p>
<p>[I was slightly mad when the first 8-star card I pulled was some communication non-sense, but ㅋㅋㅋ I love that you can’t reject it ㅋㅋㅋ]</p>
<p>“…Can’t you just talk?”</p>
<p>Unable to stand it any longer, Kim Suho nudged Chae Nayun who was standing next to him. But Chae Nayun remained silent and shook her head.</p>
<p>[No, I have to get used to this. It’s harder to use than you think.]</p>
<p>“…Ehew, do what you want.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shook his head.</p>
<p>While they were testing the cards they acquired, the command tent’s door opened and Aileen walked in. She glanced at Kim Suho and Chae Nayun before shouting loudly.</p>
<p>“All members! Come out!”</p>
<p>Her voice carried a small portion of her Spirit Speech power. Immediately, all 177 members of the underground fortress walked out of their barracks in a daze.</p>
<p>Seeing them standing in a line, Aileen said with satisfaction, “You all bought cards yesterday, right?”</p>
<p>But replies were unenthusiastic as most Heroes present were elites who were too powerful to serve under someone else.</p>
<p>“Tsk, well I’m sure you’ll know what cards are useful. Exchange them if you need to. Anyways, the reason I called you is…” Aileen put on a serious expression. “…to tell you that Africa has villages.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Chae Nayun and other Heroes, who were busy taking out their cards, all tilted their heads.</p>
<p>“Orden kidnapped humans and built villages in Africa. The Association says it’s to deter us from dropping nuclear bombs, but who knows… Anyways, we decided to form a reconnaissance team.”</p>
<p>The Chief Strategist, ‘Yi Gongmyung’, ordered the Special Task Force to form a reconnaissance team to scout the outside.</p>
<p>“It’s voluntary, so let me know if you want to participate. It’s going to be a dangerous mission, so I’ll offer the three 7-star cards I have.”</p>
<p>“I’ll participate!” Someone shouted and raised her hand the moment Aileen finished her speech. It was Chae Nayun, who has recently taken a liking to ‘dangerous missions’.</p>
<p>“I’ll participate too.”</p>
<p>“Same here.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go as well.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, and Jin Seyeon quickly followed after. The reconnaissance team now had four people.</p>
<p>“Mm, great.” Aileen nodded contently.</p>
<p>“I’ll be the pathfinder”</p>
<p>Then, the man who introduced himself as Rebé spoke up. He had stayed in the underground fortress even after his mission was over, serving as a janitor.</p>
<p>“…If there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s finding the correct path.”</p>
<p>With a smile, Bell looked back and forth between Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, and Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jin Sahyuk was establishing an independent path all by herself.</p>
<p>“Fuck… shit… I’m gonna burn to death.”</p>
<p>She cursed with every step as she walked through African land.</p>
<p>She was toiling under the hot sun just to find Bell, who had cut off contact with her.</p>
<p>“Huu, huu… huu….”</p>
<p>She walked through the desert without a single equipment on her.</p>
<p>If a monster or a humanoid monster appeared, she killed them with her energy.</p>
<p>Monsters who smelled blood then approached her, and she quickly killed them as well.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, humanoid monsters who smelled magic power approached her. They called themselves the ‘humanoid monster patrols’, though Jin Sahyuk quickly dispatched them as well.</p>
<p>Killing, walking, killing, walking.</p>
<p>She repeated this cycle for a long time before smelling a lingering scent in the air. It was different than the smell of blood or magic. It was the smell of a person she knew.</p>
<p>“This… <em>sniff, sniff.</em>”</p>
<p>Like a dog, she sniffed the air in all directions.</p>
<p>“It’s Bell.”</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly Bell. But it wasn’t just Bell’s scent she smelled. There were at least four more, which meant Bell had companions…</p>
<p>“What is that son of a bitch planning this time?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes and sent a transmission once again.</p>
<p>—Bell, answer. I’m in Africa. Your scent is here. What are you scheming?</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5…</p>
<p>Five seconds later, a reply came back.</p>
<p>—Oh~ You came all the way to Africa~? I’m scouting the area with my companions right now.</p>
<p>—Companions?</p>
<p>—Yep~ Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, Shin Jonghak, and Jin Seyeon. You know all four of them right?</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>They were the two men Jin Sahyuk detested the most. Her face quickly distorted to a frown.</p>
<p>—…What are you planning to do with Kim Suho? Get over here, now.</p>
<p>—But I can’t~ I’m restricted by Spirit Speech. I have to obey them until Orden dies.</p>
<p>—Stop fooling around, you son of a bitch. I know you can get rid of it any time you want.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk kept sending Mental Transmissions until her hair stood on ends.</p>
<p>But when Jin Sahyuk’s language began to turn bad, Bell cut off contact once again, and Jin Sahyuk had no choice but to stomp her feet in anger.</p>
<p>“You motherfucking piece of shit, wait ‘til I get my hands on you…”</p>
<p>Demon Realm, demon merchants, Baal’s descent.</p>
<p>There were many questions she wanted to ask, yet Bell avoided her like he developed a new hobby of leaving people on cliffhangers.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>‘Bell, the eternal death you so wanted, I’ll grant it to you personal the moment I see you again.’ Jin Sahyuk clenched her teeth and began to chase Bell’s scent.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Africa’s blazing sun set.</p>
<p>The scorching heat quickly disappeared, replaced by a freezing cold, and the world became shrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>I used this opportunity to leave Crean with Boss, Cheok Jungyeong, and Tenzuhar. We planned to head to the second village.</p>
<p>We let Tenzuhar guide us.</p>
<p>“Not all humanoid monsters are loyal to Orden, <em>slurp.</em> Monsters are at the root of humanoid monsters, <em>slurp.</em> We instinctively desire battle and strength, <em>slurp.</em> If a humanoid monster stronger than Orden appears, Orden’s humanoid monsters will surely turn on him, <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar insulted Orden to gain our favor.</p>
<p>“This is a secret, but I never liked Orden, <em>slurp.</em> In fact, I’m on the side of humans, <em>slurp.</em> I’ve been planning on taking Crean’s humans and escaping from Africa, <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>He was clearly lying, but I let him be.</p>
<p>“So what do you want us to do about it?”</p>
<p>But Cheok Jungyeong seemed to think otherwise as he placed his hand on Tenzuhar’s head.</p>
<p>“Ah, hahaha, n-nothing, i-it’s just that I, I wanted you to know that there are humanoid monsters like me….”</p>
<p>“I’m looking at a humanoid monster like you right now. Stop blabbering nonsense and explain where we’re going.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong shot his eyes open and glared at Tenzuhar.</p>
<p>“Y-Y-Yes, of course. A mid-rank village called ‘Lupiton’ is a little ways ahead. Lupiton’s lord is ‘Pleron’, a snow-bird humanoid monster.”</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Boss received a text message from Jain.</p>
<p>“Mm~ Jain says she’s excavating ores.”</p>
<p>“Great.”</p>
<p>‘Premian’ was an excellent ore, a treasure that was only found in Africa. In fact, most ores found in Africa were rare and precious. I designed Africa to be a high-risk, high-return place.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s time to upgrade my equipment.”</p>
<p>Premian was a delicate, thin ore. Just applying it on the surface of an item could improve its toughness many times.</p>
<p>At this rate, I wouldn’t be surprised if I overgeared myself to victory.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Then, Boss looked at me somewhat enviously. I smiled, thinking that it was cute.</p>
<p>“I’ll make one for you too, Boss.”</p>
<p>“…Mm, I won’t decline.”</p>
<p>“Make me one too, kiddo. I don’t need anything grand, just shoes. There aren’t many that fit my feet, and even if I find one, it quickly breaks.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong asked for a new equipment too, when Tenzuhar suddenly looked back at me.</p>
<p>His lizard-like eyes were sparkling brightly.</p>
<p>Curious, I waited for him to speak.</p>
<p>“…<em>Slurp.</em> I, I’m also afraid I’ll be assassinated… <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>“What? Did this lizard go mad?”</p>
<p>“Ah, hehe, I’m kidding, <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>As Cheok Jungyeong was about to smack Tenzuhar…</p>
<p><em>chwaaaa—</em></p>
<p>The sound of wind shook the area.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Because it was quiet until now, the sudden change was easily noticed. Furthermore, the air contained a faint scent of magic power.</p>
<p>I turned to the direction the wind came from and infused magic power into my Thousand-Mile Eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 287. Clouds of War (4)</p>
<p>Kim Suho left the dark, stifling underground fortress and set foot on the hot and dry African soil.</p>
<p>The goal of this mission was to investigate the ‘villages’ that Rumi had talked about. The team was ordered to confirm if there really were ‘villages’ in Africa and if there were, how many residents were residing in them and to find out the reason Orden had built these villages in the first place.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute.”</p>
<p>The reconnaissance team was made up of Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Chae Nayun, and Jin Seyeon, in addition to Bell and Rumi who were to serve as guides. As it was necessary for the team to move stealthily, Kim Suho took out his collection of cards.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Stealth Powder] [7-Star] <em>Effective Good</em></p>
<p>- Powder that erases presence (200g)</p>
<p>- Sprinkle this powder on your body to remove traces of physical movement (The effect lasts 24 hours per 3g.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He had obtained this card at the Card Kingdom.</p>
<p>It was perfect for a mission as secretive as the current one.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please sprinkle this on your body.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho used his card without holding back. The powder concealed the presences of the six members, and the team began their mission smoothly.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>They moved in complete silence.</p>
<p>After four hours of endless walking, the team arrived at a rainforest.</p>
<p>The rainforest was big and dense with trees, but Bell was able to find the right path with Rumi’s help. The monsters in the rainforest didn’t notice the Heroes passing by them.</p>
<p>[Hey. Hey, hey, Kim Suho.]</p>
<p>As they pushed their way through the dense forest, Chae Nayun suddenly sent Kim Suho a message.</p>
<p>[You got the quest too, right?]</p>
<p>Kim Suho knew exactly what Chae Nayun was talking about.</p>
<p>「Quest — Reconnaissance Mission.」</p>
<p>「Completion Reward — Gain DP. Stat ‘Tenacity’ increases slightly.」</p>
<p>This quest alert had suddenly popped up when he first received the mission. It was similar to the quests from the Tower of Wish but also somewhat different.</p>
<p>Kim Suho wrote the reply without a word.</p>
<p>[Yeah, I received it, too.]</p>
<p>[Hey, what does it say you get from clearing this?]</p>
<p>[DP and a stat.]</p>
<p>[Oh. Same here.]</p>
<p>At that moment, Bell, who had been leading the team from the front, suddenly stopped. Kim Suho also stopped and looked ahead.</p>
<p>At a spot where the rainforest finally seemed to end, Bell spoke.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’re here.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and the other members of the reconnaissance team approached Bell. They could finally see the view that Bell’s body was blocking.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Their jaws dropped in shock, and they became speechless.</p>
<p>They knew this part of Africa to be a vast field with sunset-colored grass and tall green trees gracefully in harmony with each other. That was what savannas usually looked like.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>But the scenery that was laid out in front of them was nothing like what they had expected.</p>
<p>It was more a city than a village. Only a trace of savanna remained where the tall buildings stood in line. A 6-story tall building stood at the center of what seemed to be the shopping district. The downtown and the residential areas were separated, and humans and humanoid monsters were crowding the streets.</p>
<p>“This village is called ‘Lupiton’. It’s one of Orden’s biggest mid-rank villages. Most humans who live here have been brainwashed. The population is about 300,000 - 500,000, including humanoid monsters. So it’s basically a medium-sized city. The lord of this village is a True Bone-rank humanoid monster named ‘Pleron’.”</p>
<p>Rumi explained as soon as she saw the village.</p>
<p>‘Mid-rank village, Lupiton,’ Chae Nayun thought, ‘If this is only mid-rank, then just how big is an upper-rank village?’</p>
<p>“If this is only mid-rank, then just how big is an upper-rank village?” Chae Nayun spoke exactly what was on her mind.</p>
<p>“Upper-rank villages aren’t big. They’re actually ‘laboratories’ where Orden’s scientists transform humans into humanoid monsters.”</p>
<p>“…What? Laboratories?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Because Orden has brainwashed these people, they all want to become residents of a high-rank village. However, in order to become one of those residents, they have to first increase their ‘rank’ through self-cultivation. But when they actually arrive at a high-rank village, they immediately become material for a humanoid monster….”</p>
<p>Just as Rumi was about to continue with her explanation, a boiling, vicious hostility descended upon them.</p>
<p>“I finally found you….”</p>
<p>The team turned their gaze to where the voice came from.</p>
<p>“You son of a bitch.”</p>
<p>There was only a single figure in the spotless African sky— it was Jin Sahyuk. She glared at Bell and Rumi with blazing anger in her eyes.</p>
<p>Bell gulped and Rumi quickly hid behind Chae Nayun and Jin Seyeon. Her reaction seemed fit for a scared spy, so Chae Nayun and Jin Seyeon protected her without question.</p>
<p>“…Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was the first to utter her name. But Kim Suho was the farthest thing from Jin Sahyuk’s mind right now. Her anger was directed towards the man in the hood, Bell.</p>
<p>“You fucker—”</p>
<p>—Sahyuk. Can you please calm down?</p>
<p>Bell quickly sent Jin Sahyuk a message before she could even finish her sentence.</p>
<p>“What? You—”</p>
<p>—I’m sorry. I really am. I never expected you to find me this fast. It seems you have grown yet again, Sahyuk. I’m proud of you.</p>
<p>Bell was confused. He wasn’t lying when he said that Jin Sahyuk had grown. She probably had the highest understanding of the new stats, [Nonobservance] and [Distortion].</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s why I—”</p>
<p>—Just let me go this time. You’ll ruin everything if you create a ruckus here. Can’t you see Chae Nayun and Kim Suho are here?</p>
<p>“Bullshit….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s anger was like an erupting volcano that couldn’t be stopped. Bell, left with no other choice, dragged Kim Hajin into their conversation once again.</p>
<p>—Chae Nayun here has a history with Kim Hajin. Some of the things that she knows doesn’t match what you know.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>—You think Kim Hajin is your servant, right? But Chae Nayun’s memories tell a different story. You do know the name of the skill I learned at the Tower of Wish, hmm?</p>
<p>Bell learned an ultimate skilled called [Sea of Memories]. This skill allowed him to explore other people’s memories while they were asleep or unconscious. Bell looked into a lot of people’s memories during his stay at the underground fortress.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was one of his easiest targets. Her memories were filled with emotions and trauma that could not be overlooked.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>—Sahyuk, it’s possible that Kim Hajin is lying. You have to make sure he isn’t, don’t you think?</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk knew Bell was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>—Plus, aren’t you curious what kind of emotions and memories Chae Nayun has about Kim Hajin? I bet you’d be surprised if you knew.</p>
<p>She was indeed curious about Chae Nayun’s memories. What about them made Bell so confident?</p>
<p>—Just act like you don’t know us, Sahyuk. Can’t you tell from the fact Rumi is here that we’re doing all of this for you?</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk decided to let Bell trick her just this once.</p>
<p>“K-Kim Suho, you bastard. I’ve been looking for you for a long time.”</p>
<p>She pretended that Kim Suho was her target all along. But she sounded awkward, and even Kim Suho seemed confused by the sudden change in her demeanor.</p>
<p>“…Me?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, you traitor. You god damn traitor.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking for you. Kim Suho, you son of a bitch, you disloyal dog, brainless bull. You turtle look-alike, rodent eater. You’re so dead.”</p>
<p>Though she sounded a bit strange, Jin Sahyuk’s anger was real.</p>
<p>Kim Suho clutched Misteltein and glared at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Okay, but maybe try to hold it in? We’re right next to Orden’s village. If we fight here, then we’d all disco-”</p>
<p>“What is that bitch saying?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho tried to appease Jin Sahyuk, but one particular member of his team couldn’t possibly pass over Jin Sahyuk’s insults.</p>
<p>With a face distorted from anger like a Troll, Chae Nayun stepped forward to confront Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Who the hell are you? Where did this crazy bitch come from?”</p>
<p>“…What? What did you say, vermin?”</p>
<p>“You’re the vermin.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>The two scowled at each other with a similar look on their faces. Sparks shot up where their gazes met. The unstoppable staring contest was about to begin….</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man appeared from behind the bushes. Everyone turned their attention to him.</p>
<p>No one knew who he was, not even Bell or Rumi. This man, who seemed to be in his 30s, held a basket in one hand and a sharp sickle in the other. He seemed to be a resident of the village.</p>
<p>The man, who had already been brainwashed by the humanoid monsters, stared blankly at Kim Suho before taking a step back.</p>
<p>“Are you people… outsiders?”</p>
<p>The way he grabbed his smartwatch made it obvious that he intended to report them to the authorities.</p>
<p>Everyone nervously exchanged glances with each other. Finally, Rumi spoke.</p>
<p>“No, we’re also from the village.”</p>
<p>“Village?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lupiton. We came out to gather some crops and a fight broke out among us.”</p>
<p>Still, in doubt, the man asked, “…What kind of crop?”</p>
<p>“Laurail.”</p>
<p>Laurail was a very useful crop that could be made into medicinal pills or used when forging weapons. It was one of the plants that only grew in Africa.</p>
<p>“Mm. So you <em>are</em> Lupiton’s residents.”</p>
<p>The man smiled and hung his sickle around his waist.</p>
<p>“You should stop fighting and leave. This is a dangerous area. It’s under strict watch because Sacred Bone Lord ‘Tigris’ is scheduled to visit in a week. If you get caught by the police, you could be put in jail.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, I see. Let’s go together, then.”</p>
<p>Rumi and Bell followed the man first.</p>
<p>“…Chae Nayun. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho grabbed Chae Nayun by her wrist and pulled her.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk. We haven’t seen each other since Akatrina, huh? I see you’re acquainted with Kim Suho as well.”</p>
<p>“…Stop talking to me.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak and Jin Sahyuk walked awkwardly with each other, and lastly, Jin Seyeon whispered on the radio from the back.</p>
<p>“We found a village called Lupiton. We’ll head inside.”</p>
<p>—Inside?</p>
<p>“Yes. The situation has deviated from our initial plan, but it seems people here don’t suspect us because the village population is high. However, all the residents have already been brainwashed by Orden.”</p>
<p>—…Brainwashed? Mm… okay. But keep the reports coming. Also, send me some photos.</p>
<p>“Yes, if anything happens, I'll send you a request for help.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon continued to walk with her eyes fixated on Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I faced the direction the wind came from and released ‘Thousand-Mile Eyes’. My field of vision extended in an instant and reached the point where the magic power had started. At a distance, I could see… an insect the size of my hand.</p>
<p>“…What’s that?”</p>
<p>The insect was glowing gold.</p>
<p>It was a dragonfly flapping two pairs of golden wings, scurrying away in a hurry.</p>
<p>“It’s a gold dragonfly.”</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp.</em> Gold dragonfly?”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Do you know what that is?”</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp.</em> Of course.”</p>
<p>When Tenzuhar nodded, the dragonfly had already come near us. It was as fast as Kurukuru, but I activated Bullet Time and even used [Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration] to catch the insect.</p>
<p>I looked at the dragonfly in my hand.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Second Golden Dragonfly] [Pinnacle-grade Luck Item]</p>
<p>—Lucky item.</p>
<p>—It’s hard to catch, but it feels like something good will happen when you have this dragonfly with you.</p>
<p>「Produces 50 DP every hour.」</p>
<p>「Every stat except for invariable stats increases by 1」</p>
<p>「Luck Bonus — This dragonfly will boost certain characteristics. Keep it safe.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”</p>
<p>“Ooh, <em>slurp,</em> Congratulations, <em>slurp.</em> This golden dragonfly is a very rare insect that all the Sacred Bone and True Bone humanoid monsters have been looking for, <em>slurp.</em> They say they become stronger when they catch the dragonfly, <em>slurp.</em> It’s an insect that suddenly appeared along with demon merchants, <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>I threw the dragonfly into Stigma without thinking.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt a massive headache.</p>
<p>“…Agh.”</p>
<p>The pain was of a familiar kind but less severe than before.</p>
<p>I clenched my teeth and looked down at my shoulder.</p>
<p>There, a steak of Stigma had only partially been engraved. I would have to say it was only 0.4 streaks in terms of length.</p>
<p>I stared at the streak in confusion but soon realized why this was happening.</p>
<p>It was because of the ‘Bonus Luck’ effect.</p>
<p>Since I put the dragonfly in Stigma, the bonus effect had been applied to it.</p>
<p>At that moment, Boss asked me, “Lotus, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes. I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>Somehow the lucky dragonfly became mine, but I knew there had to be more to this story.</p>
<p>I still didn’t know what this insect was running away from.</p>
<p>I stared into the distance.</p>
<p>“…Huh, both humanoid monsters and Djinns are there.”</p>
<p>A number of humanoid monsters and Djinns were chasing after the dragonfly.</p>
<p>It was easy to tell who they were. The Djinns were wearing robes embroidered with the symbol of Nine Evils’ ‘Brutality’, and one of the humanoid monsters looked human except for a pair of bat wings on his back.</p>
<p>“Hey. That monster over there has bat wings. Do you know him?”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Ah~ I do, <em>slurp.</em> That’s ‘Lacurdra’, the youngest Sacred Bone Lord.”</p>
<p>“I see where the name comes from, but… what’s this Sacred Bone thing?”</p>
<p>“Sacred Bone refers to humanoid monsters who are very similar to humans, <em>slurp.</em> They have reached genetic perfection.”</p>
<p>Confronting them head on didn’t seem like such a good choice.</p>
<p>“Boss, Cheok Jungyeong, let’s take a detour.”</p>
<p>Boss and Cheok Jungyeong shrugged. They couldn’t see what I was seeing, so they had nothing to comment on.</p>
<p>“Tenzuhar, lead us.”</p>
<p>“Of course, <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>In the distance, the humanoid monsters and Djinns were going on a rampage as they frantically searched for the dragonfly that was already mine.</p>
<p>We continued to walk.</p>
<p>After 2 hours, we finally arrived at the second village.</p>
<p>“Ah, finally. That’s ‘Lupiton’, <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>The moment Tenzuhar pointed at Lupiton, we became speechless.</p>
<p>“…What.”</p>
<p>The scenery that was laid out in front of us was-</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a city?”</p>
<p>It was nothing short of a human city.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The full moon was high up in the night sky.</p>
<p>The reconnaissance team that infiltrated Lupiton had divided themselves into two teams and began to explore the city.</p>
<p>Kim Suho volunteered to be put in the same team as Jin Sahyuk. He was determined to sacrifice himself to watch over the bomb that was sure to explode at some point.</p>
<p>“I’ve acquired crucial information. Tigris, who ravaged China, is coming here. Maybe we can try to assassinate him….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho spoke as he walked down the streets with Jin Sahyuk and Rumi. He was hoping to gain Jin Sahyuk’s cooperation, but as usual, she didn’t even seem to be listening to him.</p>
<p>“Haaam~” Jin Sahyuk gave a big yawn and remarked nonchalantly, “Whatever. More importantly, what’s your relationship with that woman?”</p>
<p>“That woman… You mean Chae Nayun?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Jin Sahyuk nodded.</p>
<p>Kim Suho thought for a moment. “…We’re friends.”</p>
<p>“Geez, you have a lot of friends. But maybe you should think twice before befriending someone so dumb.”</p>
<p>“She’s nicer than you.”</p>
<p>“…Tsk,” Jin Sahyuk clicked her tongue and looked around. There were many interesting facilities here in the village of the monsters. There was an arena, a training ground, a magic power invigoration facility, and more….</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk watched them, then suddenly stopped and looked at Kim Suho. Kim Suho, who was walking ahead, also stopped, turned around, and looked at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“What now?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>‘What’s the relationship between Kim Hajin and that woman?’</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk wanted to ask him, but she couldn’t bring herself to speak. Instead, she turned her gaze to Rumi. Things were a little awkward between them because they were pretending not to know each other.</p>
<p>“Where’s Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk finally uttered a different question. At that moment, Kim Suho heard Chae Nayun’s voice.</p>
<p>[Hey Kim Suho. We found a place for us to stay in. I’ll send you the address so come over when you finish looking around. Also, ditch that crazy bitch.]</p>
<p>The message sounded very much like Chae Nayun. Kim Suho smiled and replied.</p>
<p>[I’m going with her. Please don’t fight and try to talk to her.]</p>
<p>[I can’t <em>not</em> fight. The way she talks is so irritating….]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned.</p>
<p>“What are you laughing for?”</p>
<p>“Mm? Nothing.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s frown deepened.</p>
<p>“Yeah, right. Tell me what you just did.”</p>
<p>“I said nothing.”</p>
<p>“You were talking to Kim Hajin, right? Did you send him a Mental Transmission or something?”</p>
<p>“I said it’s nothing….”</p>
<p>As they argued with each other, a huge shadow cast over Kim Suho and Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk bumped into something firm.</p>
<p>“Ah, what now…?” Annoyed, Jin Sahyuk looked up with a frown.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>A tough-looking figure was looking down at her.</p>
<p>Both Kim Suho and Jin Sahyuk knew who he was. Especially Jin Sahyuk, he had left a lasting impression.</p>
<p>“Kuuum….”</p>
<p>He growled like a beast. Jin Sahyuk and Rumi widened their eyes and looked up at the man— Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Cheok Jungeyong asked, “Why are you here?”</p>
<p>He had met all three of them before.</p>
<p>His relationship with Rumi was especially complicated, and he looked at her somewhat faintly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 288. Society of Dead Humanoid Monsters (1)</p>
<p>“What are you doing here—”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong’s words resounded with heavy pressure. Kim Suho and Jin Sahyuk stared at Cheok Jungyeong in vein-squeezing tension.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong pointed at Kim Suho, then at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>He pretended not to have seen Rumi.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen you in the Tower, and you….” Cheok Jungyeong continued with a sigh, “You managed to escape.”</p>
<p>“…So?” Jin Sahyuk answered. Her usually dignified manner was nowhere to be seen as she was trembling slightly. It wasn’t that she was afraid. It was purely because the man standing in front of her was <em>tricky</em> to deal with.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had fought with Cheok Jungyeong before and realized that he had reached absolute perfection physically.</p>
<p>The way he destroyed her manipulated realities with nothing but raw power was surreal. He reminded her of Kim Hajin, but he was slightly different as well.</p>
<p>“You lot are from that fortress, right?” Cheok Jungyeong asked Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded and replied, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“…But not this one, right?” Cheok Jungyeong pointed at Jin Sahyuk with his chin, and Kim Suho shook his head in response.</p>
<p>“No, she’s also one of us.”</p>
<p>“Pft.” Cheok Jungyeong let out a snort. “Funny. I beat her up not long ago and locked her in a cell.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, the startled Kim Suho glanced at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Is he telling the truth?”</p>
<p>“….” Jin Sahyuk didn’t answer, but her furrowed brows were enough of an answer.</p>
<p>“If Boss was here, she would have beat her to a pulp and cut off her limbs….”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong stared at Jin Sahyuk and grinned. He didn’t discriminate based on gender or wealth. He only treated people differently based on their age. Only the young and the old were saved from being his targets.</p>
<p>“…But there’s no reason to fight you now. It’s not the right place, and we’re allied with you lot from the fortress anyways.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong was uncharacteristically cold and rational. He didn’t want to start a fight like he always did.</p>
<p>Rumi stared at Cheok Jungyeong with a sad look.</p>
<p>“I’ll let you go this time, Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong remembered Jin Sahyuk’s name. It meant he acknowledged her strength.</p>
<p>Of course, Jin Sahyuk didn’t know this side of Cheok Jungyeong and contemplated attacking him to regain her dignity. Thankfully, Rumi grabbed her arm and stopped her.</p>
<p>“He’s letting us go. Let’s leave.”</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sighed reluctantly. But as they were about to leave, she suddenly remembered something and stopped Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“Oh right, oi!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong looked back at her quietly. Lit under the moonlight, Cheok Jungyeong’s eyes flashed with chilling killing intent. Most people’s heart would have skipped a beat in terror, but Jin Sahyuk maintained her composure.</p>
<p>“…I just want to know something. Are your friends here too?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk knew a secret that only the members of the Chameleon Troupe were aware of – the identity of Black Lotus.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong didn’t immediately answer. It was then.</p>
<p><em>Prrrrr—</em></p>
<p>The wind blew along with the sound of batting wings. Everyone immediately looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>A humanoid monster was flapping his wings in the air. Soon, it descended between them.</p>
<p><em>Koong—</em></p>
<p>A heavy thud resounded.</p>
<p>Kim Suho instantly realized that the humanoid monster was with the ‘police’. It wasn’t all that hard considering he was wearing a police uniform.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap.</em></p>
<p>The humanoid monster shrugged his shoulders as he approached the group. Everyone’s expressions stiffened as they stared at the unexpected guest, and the humanoid monster glanced at the humans present.</p>
<p>In this moment of tension, Kim Suho wondered if he should attack the humanoid monster. He couldn’t feel any other presences nearby or any watchful eyes. If the humanoid monster suspected them even a little bit, he was determined to cut him down immediately.</p>
<p>As Kim Suho carefully put his hand on Misteltein…</p>
<p>“From 1 a.m. to 6 a.m., only humanoid monsters may stay outside. Humans are prohibited. There are 10 minutes left, so hurry back. If you’re found after 10 minutes, you will be punished.” The humanoid monster spoke. That was it.</p>
<p><em>Prrrr—</em></p>
<p>The humanoid monster flapped his wings and flew up.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and his group stared at him in a daze, and Cheok Jungyeong smirked.</p>
<p>“Strange, isn’t it? Most humanoid monsters are like that. Unless they’re unusually picky, they won’t even check your identity. Maybe it’s because there are too many people living here.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong murmured. At that moment, a voice rang out in Kim Suho’s head.</p>
<p>[Hey, where are you!? It’s an emergency!]</p>
<p>It was a message from Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Before Kim Suho could reply, the voice became louder.</p>
<p>[Emergency! E-mer-gen-cy!]</p>
<p>Kim Suho quickly answered, wanting to spare his ears.</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>[Answer quicker! I’ll give you our coordinates so come here immediately. We’re together with residents who escaped the brainwash.]</p>
<p>[What?]</p>
<p>[There are people here who are no longer brainwashed!]</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>[Hurry over here with Rumi. Lose that crazy bitch.]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun sent him her location, and Kim Suho quickly entered the coordinates into his smartwatch. She was about 20 minutes north.</p>
<p>“…Did something happen?” Rumi asked, seeing Kim Suho’s sudden change in expression. Kim Suho stared at Rumi, Jin Sahyuk, then Cheok Jungyeong silently.</p>
<p>Although Chae Nayun said to ditch Jin Sahyuk…</p>
<p>“Something urgent came up with the other team. Follow me.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The set of coordinates Chae Nayun sent led to a grocery store. It was neither new nor old and was a typical 1-floor store.</p>
<p>Kim Suho walked inside with a quizzical look.</p>
<p><em>Shoong—</em></p>
<p>The automatic door opened, and three human employees and one humanoid monster stared at Kim Suho at the same time.</p>
<p>“I….”</p>
<p>Before Kim Suho could say anything, a puppy-like humanoid monster hopped over and asked.</p>
<p>“Are you with Jin Seyeon-nim?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I am. They are too.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho pointed at Cheok Jungyeong, Jin Sahyuk, and Rumi.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>The four of them followed the humanoid monster.</p>
<p><em>Wag, wag—</em> After a few minutes of staring at his wagging tail, the group arrived at a secret passageway.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>“Go in. Your friends are inside.”</p>
<p>The secret passageway was a manhole hidden under a shelf. A ladder to an underground area could be seen.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and the others stared at each other before taking the ladder down one by one.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this isn’t a trap?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong asked once they arrived downstairs. They found themselves in an empty, dark room with nothing inside. While they were standing around confused, the wall in front of them suddenly moved left and right, revealing a new room.</p>
<p>Beyond the wall was a scene no one expected to see.</p>
<p>The smell of rice and magic power flowed out, people swinging swords and spears on dummies could be seen, and dozens of houses were lined up along the huge training ground.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was standing in the middle with a smile.</p>
<p>“You’re here.”</p>
<p>“Uh… w-where are we?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was at a loss of words.</p>
<p>“We’re at the Resistance Village. People who escaped brainwashing secretly built this place underground….”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong walked past Kim Suho and Chae Nayun and stood in the middle of the underground village.</p>
<p>“Now this is interesting… Oi.”</p>
<p>Then, he shared his vision with Kim Hajin who should be watching from a distance.</p>
<p>“Can you see it?”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin’s voice returned.</p>
<p>—Yes, I can. Looks like there are about 300 people. They’re mostly Heroes from what I can see. Continue looking around.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Muffled whispers then reached Cheok Jungyeong, who was communicating with Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“…Isn’t he a humanoid monster? He has to be, right? There’s no way a human can have a body like that. He must be an ogre humanoid monster.”</p>
<p>The residents seemed to be taken aback by his dignified stature. Cheok Jungyeong grinned and announced, “I’m human! One that crushes humanoid monsters—”</p>
<p>Hearing Cheok Jungyeong’s voice, Jin Seyeon came out of the village hall with a blonde man.</p>
<p>“Suho…?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s eyes widened when she saw Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“…Oh~ It’s been a while, Jin Seyeon~”</p>
<p>The corners of Cheok Jungyeong’s mouth curled up.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon was taken aback by the unexpected encounter, but she soon nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, it has. You’re our ally, correct?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say ally. Temporary comrade is more like it.”</p>
<p>“Mm, that’s perfect.”</p>
<p>With that, Jin Seyeon called Kim Suho’s group over.</p>
<p>“This is the ‘Resistance Village’. Ellio-ssi found us scouting the village upstairs and brought us here.” Jin Seyeon began to explain. She pointed at the blonde man standing next to her.</p>
<p>“Ellio-ssi, please introduce yourself.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Ellio was a handsome, white Latino man.</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Spain’s high-rank Hero, Ellio. I’m leading the ‘Underground Resistance’ in this place. It’s an honor to meet you, Kim Suho-ssi and….”</p>
<p>Ellio looked up at Cheok Jungyeong. His towering height and intimidating face made him look like a tyrant.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong spoke, “I’m Cheok Jungyeong.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon? Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
<p>Ellio’s eyes widened. Cheok Jungyeong gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“Haha, you know my name?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Korean history and history of Heroes are required courses….”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, right, that’s me! I’m Cheok—”</p>
<p>—Don’t get overexcited. You’re not going to talk about your past life, are you?</p>
<p>As Cheok Jungyeong was laughing happily, Kim Hajin calmed him down. Cheok Jungyeong frowned and closed his mouth.</p>
<p>—You became a better listener. I like it.</p>
<p>“…What’d you say?”</p>
<p>“Are you talking with Black Lotus right now?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon easily noticed that something was off.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong flinched slightly.</p>
<p>“What? Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>“Ha, I knew you unfair cowards wouldn’t be walking around alone.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s eyes widened and Jin Sahyuk grumbled. Jin Sahyuk still remembered the 2 on 1 fight she had to endure.</p>
<p>—Ah, they found out because of you. Damn it.</p>
<p>“Why is this my fault?”</p>
<p>—Just make something up.</p>
<p>Facing everyone’s looks, Cheok Jungyeong sighed.</p>
<p>“You bastard… what am I supposed to say in this situation?”</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>…One hour later, Kim Suho’s group and Cheok Jungyeong sat down inside the village hall. Ellio explained how the Resistance Village came to be.</p>
<p>“At first, we believed we were born here and had no doubts doing our daily tasks. But Yurang-ssi helped undo the brainwashing we suffered.”</p>
<p>“Yurang-ssi… Is that the humanoid monster we met?”</p>
<p>Ellio nodded at Kim Suho’s question.</p>
<p>“Yes, Yurang-ssi was assigned as the manager of this grocery store. He’s very supportive of humans. In fact… we don’t call him a humanoid monster.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Cheok Jungyeong stealthily looked back at Rumi, who was paying attention to Ellio’s explanation.</p>
<p>“With Yurang-ssi’s help, we were able to help many people regain their memories. But because one had to have trained in magic power to use Yurang-ssi’s method, we only awakened Heroes mid-rank or higher.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk, on the other hand, looked around the village hall, only half-listening to Ellio. She was looking for Bell, but Bell was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“…So how did you make this village? The houses here are no different from some of the buildings in Seoul.” Kim Suho asked.</p>
<p>Ellio nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“That’s a good question. You see, we used ‘DP’ to build this town. In other words, we received help from a demon merchant.”</p>
<p>“…Demon merchant?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there is a Dungeon nearby. Inside it are demonic beasts we can hunt for DP. It wouldn’t be wrong to say this village was created by a demon merchant. He agreed to help us with any trades that don't involve escaping.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon asked, “What is your plan now?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Ellio fell silent.</p>
<p>He looked around the room and took a deep breath before answering.</p>
<p>“To assassinate Tigris, one of Orden’s four Great Generals.”</p>
<p>Ellio’s voice struck heavily.</p>
<p>Just as Kim Suho was about to say something…</p>
<p>—Captain! Demonic beasts are running wild!</p>
<p>A loud voice rang out from outside. Everyone other than Jin Sahyuk immediately shot up and ran outside.</p>
<p>“The Dungeon is this way. Follow me!”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Next day, 10 a.m.</p>
<p>I came out to Lupiton with Boss. The village of humanoid monsters and humans was bustling with activity. However, humans were the only ones who were busy.</p>
<p>From what I found out yesterday, Orden’s villages had a clear hierarchical structure. Even humans were divided from rank-1 to rank-3. Of course, even a rank-1 human couldn’t compare to a rank-6 humanoid monster in authority.</p>
<p>Lupiton’s humanoid monsters were ‘nobles’ whose job was to oversee humans, and humans were akin to peasants or slaves.</p>
<p>“There are restaurants, cafés, and even a bowling alley.”</p>
<p>“Right, how interesting.”</p>
<p>Humans were tasked with all sorts of different jobs. Some harvested crops, some mined ores at a nearby mine, some worked as chefs, some sold smartwatches developed by humanoid monsters, and more.</p>
<p>The brainwashed citizens were living in the village as if it were perfectly natural.</p>
<p>“Hajin, it’s immediate judgment.”</p>
<p>Boss pointed at the distance. The moment I turned my gaze… <em>Crack!</em> A humanoid monster resembling a crocodile chopped off a human’s head.</p>
<p>Immediate judgment.</p>
<p>Humanoid monsters who were delegated the role of ‘manager’ by the village lord could hand out immediate judgment to humans. The judgment, unsurprisingly, was death.</p>
<p>“This is kind of what I expected from them, but not so much at the same time.”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Jain sent a message.</p>
<p>[Hajin, I finished collecting premians~ What should I do now~?]</p>
<p>Jain was currently acting as the dictator of Crean. Disguised as Tenzuhar with her Gift, Jain had ordered Tenzuhar’s servants to gather gems and ores from the deepest parts of the mine.</p>
<p>I answered.</p>
<p>[Come to Lupiton.]</p>
<p>Jain had to see and make physical contact with a target to use her Gift of Disguise. Since Lupiton had many high-ranking humanoid monsters, it was the perfect opportunity for her to disguise as a humanoid monster with a higher authority than Tenzuhar.</p>
<p>[Okay~ I’ll be there as soon as I can~]</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp.</em> What will we do now, Boss? <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar asked. He had grown used to calling me Boss before I realized.</p>
<p>“Jungyeong wants to kill Tigris, but….”</p>
<p>Tigris. Tenzuhar’s expression paled the moment he heard this name.</p>
<p>“D-Duke Tigris? <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah, have you seen him before?”</p>
<p>“N-No, not at all. He’ll kill me if I do. <em>Slurp, slurp, slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar became tongue-tied for a moment. I put my hand in his mouth and untied it myself.</p>
<p>“Keheuk. T-Thank you, <em>slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>In truth, I was curious about Tigris. He had caused a mess in China and escaped unharmed. Although the rumors said he was stronger than Chae Joochul… I would have to see him personally before making any judgment.</p>
<p>“Boss, let’s deal with the village lord first.”</p>
<p>“Village lord?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we’ll take over this city just like we did in Crean.”</p>
<p>This was the reason I called Jain in the first place.</p>
<p>Her Gift was perfect for victory without bloodshed.</p>
<p>“Oi, Tenzuhar.”</p>
<p>“Yes? <em>Slurp.</em>”</p>
<p>“Are you acquainted with Pleron?”</p>
<p>“Uh….”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar hesitated.</p>
<p><em>Slurp, slurp, slurp</em>.</p>
<p>I waited patiently at first, but I frowned when his slurping noises got annoying.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to talk?”</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp</em>… You see… we… we have a senior-junior relationship.”</p>
<p>“Senior-junior relationship? What’s that?’</p>
<p>Tenzuhar scratched his head and mumbled in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp.</em> In the Humanoid Monster Academy, Pleron was my junior and I was his senior.”</p>
<p>““…What?””</p>
<p>Boss and I both became speechless.</p>
<p>“<em>Slurp…</em> But genetic differences are impossible to overcome, <em>slurp</em>. Although I was a rank-1 humanoid monster in the theory part of tests, Pleron, whose origin is a mythical snow-bird monster, quickly began to shoot ahead, <em>slurp</em>.”</p>
<p>Tenzuhar seemed embarrassed that his junior surpassed him, but we didn’t care about that at all.</p>
<p>There was one thing that he said that caught our attention.</p>
<p>“What the hell do you mean by the academy?”</p>
<p>It was the term, ‘Humanoid Monster Academy’.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 289. Society of Dead Humanoid Monsters (2)</p>
<p>After 12 hours of fierce battle against the demonic beasts, the reconnaissance team returned to the underground village. Every day, members of the Resistance had to participate in such difficult fights. Although the use of magic power had to be restrained, the younger generation of Heroes, including Kim Suho and Chae Nayun, could stand against demonic beasts even without magic power.</p>
<p>The fight had prolonged for half a day simply because there were too many demonic beasts.</p>
<p>Although the fight was now over, that didn’t mean they could rest. The second the team returned to the village hall, Jin Seyeon connected Ellio to Aileen over the radio. Over the next three hours, Ellio explained to Aileen the plan they had named the ‘Tigris Assassination Mission’.</p>
<p>This was the summary of the mission.</p>
<p>Tigris was scheduled to visit Lupiton this Friday. Tigris was one of the most notable Sacred Bone humanoid monsters. He had an influence on the central political system and was also the head of several different factions of monsters. By assassinating Tigris who was in charge of the entire eastern region of Orden’s Kingdom that included both Lupiton and Crean, they could create a tremendous amount of confusion for the monsters.</p>
<p>The Resistance planned to take advantage of the said confusion and either escape Africa or revolt against Orden.</p>
<p>But because Ellio’s plan was still in its initial stage and had many holes, Yi Gongmyoung joined in on the conversation, and together they began planning the mission in detail. They finished at one o'clock in the morning and only then was the reconnaissance team finally able to rest.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—</em></p>
<p>“Phew….”</p>
<p>Now was the brief amount of free time before they all had to go to bed. Chae Nayun let out a deep sigh in the warm hot spring. When she was in the underground fortress, she had never even dreamed that this kind of bath would be possible. The warm water seemed to melt away all her worries and fatigue.</p>
<p>“Huhuhuhu… this is great.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun exclaimed like an old man.</p>
<p>If possible, she wanted to stay here forever. Unfortunately, the mission would resume tomorrow.</p>
<p>“Mmmm~”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stretched once and got up.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she was filled with warm languidness.</p>
<p>“Ah~ Water here feels so much better for some reason~”</p>
<p>She walked staggeringly back to the changing room.</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>She put her clothes back on and was now ready to head back to her room. But just as she was about to leave the hot spring, she noticed a mirror hanging on the wall. Chae Nayun stood in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>Her hair, which used to be short during her Cube years, was now long and wet.</p>
<p>“…It’s so bothersome.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>Long hair was nothing more than a burden during fights. During the most recent fight, her hair had poked her eyes countless times.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>Determined, Chae Nayun gathered magic power around her hand and cut her hair.</p>
<p>The detached lump of her hair brushed the side of her arms as it fell to the ground. Chae Nayun cleaned the mess up and left the hot spring.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“…Bell, where are you?”</p>
<p>She heard a small voice. After the gratifying bath that left all her senses heightened, even the smallest sound couldn’t escape her ears.</p>
<p>With a small frown, Chae Nayun slowly walked to where the voice had come from. This was her specialty ‘superior stealth’ technique that both Yoo Sihyuk and Heynckes praised her for.</p>
<p>“…Where the hell did you disappear to?”</p>
<p>At a remote corner of the village, Jin Sahyuk was whispering to someone over a walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>Just seeing her put Chae Nayun in a bad mood.</p>
<p>‘That crazy bitch.’</p>
<p>Chae Nayun turned around to leave. However, a thought suddenly crossed her mind and she stopped and hid at a spot where she could hear Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“You blocked Mental Transmission again! …Where did you go?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was speaking into the walkie-talkie assigned to her. Her face was already red with anger, but the way she was trying to keep her voice down was somewhat funny.</p>
<p>—I’m in the middle of a humanoid monster village. If I use any strange techniques like Mental Transmission, I would get discovered right away. I had no choice but to block it.</p>
<p>Bell’s voice flowed out from the other side of the radio. Chae Nayun recognized this voice as belonging to ‘Rebé’, the guide.</p>
<p>“Bell. Don’t make me mad and explain.”</p>
<p>‘Bell? Who’s Bell?’</p>
<p>“Why did you go into the village?”</p>
<p>—That’s none of your concern.</p>
<p>“The fuck….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk pounded her own chest with her fists. She seemed desperate to hold back her anger.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun listened in on their conversation in silence.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you saw through your ultimate skill. About that woman.”</p>
<p>—…Mmm. Maybe later. But I can tell you one thing right now.</p>
<p>Bell had picked up a non-combative ultimate skill called [Sea of Memories] at the Tower of Wish. To Jin Sahyuk, who wasn’t capable of learning ultimate skills, Bell’s choice seemed rather strange. But that didn’t matter. Right now, she just wanted to know what Bell found out.</p>
<p>—Kim Hajin might be deceiving you.</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>The name popped up out of the blue.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun froze.</p>
<p>—Kim Hajin might not have been your servant. I’ll tell you about the details later. I’m actually tailing Kim Hajin right now to confirm. I have to go now.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>The call ended there, and Jin Sahyuk leaned against the wall with her head in her hands. For a while she stayed still, slowly breathing in and out to relieve her anger.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun continued to watch Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“…Just what is he?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered.</p>
<p>However, not long after, Kim Suho approached her.</p>
<p>Without a word, he handed her a key chain.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“Dorm key. Your room is 205.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t grab the key and only glared at Kim Suho viciously.</p>
<p>“I see you’re used to speaking casually to me now.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kim Suho didn’t answer. He looked at Jin Sahyuk bitterly and, with a sigh, dropped the key into Jin Sahyuk’s hand.</p>
<p>“…I’m leaving.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho turned around, and Jin Sahyuk also walked in the opposite direction with the key in her hand.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was left alone to ponder.</p>
<p>‘Jin Sahyuk definitely knows Kim Hajin. She called him her servant.’</p>
<p>“What the hell does that mean…?”</p>
<p>‘Maybe it’s not ‘servant’ but ‘serpent’? Or maybe ‘fervent’?’</p>
<p>So many questions were left unanswered but she was sure of one thing: Jin Sahyuk was related to Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“Well then….”</p>
<p>‘I don’t want anything to do with her, but I guess I’ll have to become closer to her.’</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clenched her fists and checked her room number.</p>
<p>Room 207.</p>
<p>‘It’s three people per room, and Jin Sahyuk is in room 205….’</p>
<p>“I’ll have to change my room.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun hurried to the village hall.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Lupiton, the mid-rank village of humanoid monsters.</p>
<p>“Mm. I can see it now.”</p>
<p>With my Thousand-Mile Eyes, I looked into the village lord’s mansion from a hotel many miles away.</p>
<p>The mansion was similar in structure to Buckingham Palace. It was equipped with magic traps, and a number of humanoid monsters, all above rank-3, were fiercely guarding the mansion.</p>
<p>“What kind of monster is the lord~? What does he look like~?”</p>
<p>Jain asked with a smirk. She and Khalifa arrived here only three hours ago. Khalifa left right away to take Tenzuhar back to Crean.</p>
<p>I wasn’t particularly worried about Tenzuhar. He valued his life and was smart enough not to do anything rash when Droon, Jin Yohan, and the other members of the Chameleon Troupe were around.</p>
<p>“I wonder.”</p>
<p>I searched for the most private and the safest place in the mansion. A big, fancy room in the heart of the mansion, that was where the humanoid monster thought to be Pleron was.</p>
<p>“He just looks like a human with wings. He has pale skin and wings made of ice.”</p>
<p>“Is the lord a boy or a girl?”</p>
<p>“He… ah, it’s a she. Looks like the lord is a woman.”</p>
<p>“Is she pretty~?”</p>
<p>“…Why does that matter?”</p>
<p>I frowned at Jain’s weird question. Jain smirked.</p>
<p>“You know I had to be a lizard for the past day. I’d much rather transform into a pretty humanoid monster~”</p>
<p>“…Well, about that,”</p>
<p>I looked at Pleron again.</p>
<p>“You won’t have to worry this time.”</p>
<p>Pleron, who inherited the genes of a snow-bird, was without a doubt beautiful. She looked completely human except for her pointy ears, and her refined facial structure matched her pale skin very well.</p>
<p>“That’s a relief~”</p>
<p>Jain smiled mischievously and turned her gaze to Boss.</p>
<p>Boss was staring into space, muttering something. She was probably exchanging messages with someone through the Tower of Wish’s ‘System’. Ever since the Tower opened up to the public, Players could use the System anywhere, even outside the Tower.</p>
<p>I called Boss.</p>
<p>“Boss?”</p>
<p>“…Kuhum. I was talking to Wicked.”</p>
<p>Boss glanced at me and let out a dry cough.</p>
<p>“We strike when it’s dark. Our plan is simple. We go in, we capture Pleron, then Jain will disguise as Pleron.”</p>
<p>Quietly and gracefully, just like always.</p>
<p>We nodded at Boss.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>—We strike when it’s dark.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bell hid in the air and watched them.</p>
<p>—Our plan is simple. We go in, we capture Pleron, then Jain will disguise as Pleron.</p>
<p>Bell looked at Yi Byul. She had matured into a beautiful woman. He recalled how she was only a cute, pitiful girl when she was young.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Bell let out a heavy sigh. Byul had changed only because of the man standing next to her. She had found a friend she could rely on.</p>
<p>“But Byul,” Bell muttered, “He’s….”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin. His memories were disconnected from this world. Perhaps, Kim Hajin was similar to himself.</p>
<p>“He can’t be with you.”</p>
<p>He was destined to leave her someday. The pain Byul would feel from her parting with Kim Hajin might even be greater than the pain she felt when she lost ‘that man’ whom she considered her parent.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Bell, too, recalled the time he killed his best friend with his own hands. Even now the pain was unbearable.</p>
<p>But Bell, who had lived through ‘past generations’ over and over again for hundreds of years, knew that eternal death was a thousand times better than eternal life.</p>
<p>Bell couldn’t die. This was the same in reality, in different dimensions, and in the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>His body would simply scatter and turn into magic power, soon reconstructing itself into a new body. For this reason, Bell was never afraid in the face of death.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>Bell stared at Kim Hajin. In truth, he had always considered Kim Hajin ‘worthless’. As he confirmed in the Tower of Wish, Kim Hajin did not possess the ability to kill Bell, and more importantly, he had been ruining ‘Yi Byul’ whom Bell considered to be his masterpiece.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>The glimpse of Kim Hajin’s memories that Bell saw through [Sea of Memories] showed a world completely different from the one they were in right now.</p>
<p>“Hm. I guess I have no choice.”</p>
<p>Bell finally made a decision.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to take him with me.”</p>
<p>Bell felt the need to explore Kim Hajin’s memories in detail. He had managed to look into Kim Hajin’s memories for one minute, which was far less time than the time he actually needed. He would need at least a week to figure everything out about Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>And to spend a week together, he had no choice but to ‘kidnap’ Kim Hajin.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a gust of wind blew past him.</p>
<p>Bell entrusted himself to the wind; soon his body turned into dust that scattered in the air.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 290. Society of Dead Humanoid Monsters (3)</p>
<p>[England, Buckingham Palace]</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace’s most famous guest, Ah Hae-in, was currently staring at the outside scenery through the palace’s window. She looked like her usual calm self, but something about her was a little different.</p>
<p>That was the number of stars inscribed on her robe, which now numbered a glorious nine.</p>
<p>Last week, she was promoted to a 9-star magician. Her ability to summon three of the Four Cardinal Guardians had allowed her this honor.</p>
<p>The 9-star realm had only been achieved by thirty people through history. As such, Ah Hae-In felt that the world looked a bit different today. She immersed herself in England’s beauty in deep thought.</p>
<p><em>Tak, tak.</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a certain child skipped over to Ah Hae-In. Evandel glanced up at Ah Hae-In curiously, then imitated her solemn expression.</p>
<p>The two magicians stood side-by-side and stared out the window.</p>
<p>Rachel, who brought Evandel here, smiled and tried hard to hold back her laughter.</p>
<p>“…Congratulations on your protion, Master.” Evandel spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s <em>promotion</em>, not portion. Also, you don’t need to congratulate me. You will become one too soon enough.”</p>
<p>“Eeh? Me too?”</p>
<p>Evandel’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In smiled gently.</p>
<p>“…Yes, you’re already at the 8-star level.”</p>
<p>The quality of Evandel’s summons were equal to those summoned by an 8-star magician. But the sheer number of her summons easily put her at the 9-star realm.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be long until the quality of her summons would reach the 9-star realm. With enough time, the 10-star realm wouldn’t be out of reach either.</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you.”</p>
<p>Evandel bowed. Having watched Evandel’s growth, Ah Hae-In couldn’t help but find her adorable. But she was worried as well.</p>
<p>The outside world was dark.</p>
<p>It was cruel and full of schemers.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In wondered if such an innocent child could endure such a place.</p>
<p>“…Evandel.”</p>
<p>“Yeees?”</p>
<p>But the flow of time couldn’t be defied.</p>
<p>Even the clearest water would muddy as time passes, and a generational shift was inevitable.</p>
<p>A time would come when Evandel would have to reveal her overwhelming power to the world, and when that time came, countless adults would try to use her to their benefits.</p>
<p>“It’s time for training.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In decided to prepare Evandel for that inevitable day.</p>
<p>“Traiwing…?”</p>
<p>Evandel spoke nervously, but her pronunciations were a bit off due to her missing front teeth.</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In smiled.</p>
<p>“Evandel, it’s time to create your domain.”</p>
<p>To protect, one had to get stronger. Connections and fortune weren’t enough. One needed absolute strength that would let them tower over all adversaries.</p>
<p>“…Domain?”</p>
<p>Evandel tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Yes, domain.”</p>
<p>Most magicians possessed their own ‘workshop’ no matter how weak they were. A workshop was a fortress of sorts where they could develop their magic and keep outsiders away.</p>
<p>As magicians’ research happened inside their workshop, they frequently had to fight to fend off intruders who wanted access. Ah Hae-In had also experienced countless battles before arriving at the 8-star realm.</p>
<p>But a workshop wasn’t enough for Evandel.</p>
<p>Although the higher-level concept of a workshop was a ‘stronghold’, even that wasn’t enough to hold Evandel’s talents.</p>
<p>A concept above a ‘stronghold’ that no magician, not even Ah Hae-In or the Nine Stars’ Oh Jaejin, could achieve. That was a ‘domain’.</p>
<p>“It’s going to take a long time, and you won’t be able to meet anyone during it.”</p>
<p>Evandel had the talent to create and maintain a ‘domain’. But because this technique placed one’s surroundings under their command, one needed to stay in that place alone for a long time.</p>
<p>“It will be lonely and tiring. But this domain will be of great help to you.”</p>
<p>The strength to survive even if the world falls. The power to act as one wished without being used by anyone.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In wanted Evandel to develop autonomy.</p>
<p>“…Are you ready?”</p>
<p>With these words, Ah Hae-In slowly turned around. Rachel was staring at her with a worried face.</p>
<p>Rachel’s worry was justified, as a harsh process was necessary for a magician to obtain a domain. One needed to stay in a place for a long time and inscribe their will with magic power. The process could take anywhere from 6 months to 10 years.</p>
<p>But Ah Hae-In smiled.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Evandel is a stronger kid than you think.”</p>
<p>She looked down at Evandel who was deep in thought.</p>
<p>The image of Fenrir, who was whimpering in pain from Toji’s attack, surfaced in her mind. Although he was now fully healed, Evandel was deeply hurt. It was the first time she felt powerless. If she was stronger, neither Fenrir nor her other summons would have been hurt.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Evandel raised her head.</p>
<p>Her eyes were filled with firm determination.</p>
<p>“I want to get stronger.”</p>
<p>“Good…”</p>
<p>“B-But before then…”</p>
<p>Evandel stuttured.</p>
<p>“…I, I want to see Hajin.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Africa, mid-rank village Lupiton]</p>
<p>The sun set, and darkness descended on the village. Human residents had all returned to their homes as they curfew was up.</p>
<p>In other words, it was time for us to invade the lord’s residence.</p>
<p>“Get ready.”</p>
<p>Jain and I prepared ourselves at Boss’ command.</p>
<p>Boss would infiltrate the lord’s residence as a shadow, I would use [Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration] to burst in, and Jain would disguise herself as a humanoid monster to enter through the front door.</p>
<p>“We’re ready.”</p>
<p>Just as we were ready to start our plan…</p>
<p>—Tiriring.</p>
<p>I received a video call on my smartwatch.</p>
<p>“Oh? It’s Evandel.”</p>
<p>I planned to ignore it if it was Kim Suho or Yoo Yeonha, but Evandel was a different story. I asked Boss for some time and picked up the call.</p>
<p>—Hajin~</p>
<p>Evandel’s smiling face immediately came into view.</p>
<p>“Yeah, what’s up?”</p>
<p>I smiled back.</p>
<p>Evandel giggled and spoke.</p>
<p>—I wanted to see you~</p>
<p>“Suddenly? What happened?”</p>
<p>I’ve been calling or texting at least once a day, and before coming to Africa, I often visited her with Spartan.</p>
<p>—No reason~</p>
<p>“…Did something happen?”</p>
<p>I noticed a heavy atmosphere from Evandel’s expression.</p>
<p>—Mm… well…</p>
<p>Evandel hesitated for a moment before dropping her head.</p>
<p>—I don’t think I’ll be able to see you for a long time.</p>
<p>My heart sank when I heard those words.</p>
<p>It was the first time I’ve been so flustered in the past year.</p>
<p>I quickly asked back.</p>
<p>“W-Why?”</p>
<p>—Ah… um… I decided to create a domain with Master….</p>
<p>“Domain? …Ah.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, it wasn’t anything life threatening. I quickly understood what she meant.</p>
<p>A magician’s domain.</p>
<p>Just like Evandel did in the original novel, she was trying to create a domain of her own.</p>
<p>—Yes, so I won’t be able to see you. I hear the power of the domain will lessen if someone enters it during its construction.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. We can meet whenever.”</p>
<p>The basis of my [Black Lotus Uniform]’s presence-isolation effect was naturalness. Not only did it erase its wearer’s presence, but it also erased all trace of the wearer’s existence. Since not even Chae Nayun’s supernatural intuition could see through it, it shouldn’t affect Evandel’s domain either.</p>
<p>—Eeeh?</p>
<p>Evandel tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about not being able to see me and work hard at creating your domain. Make it pretty and hard. I’ll come by often.”</p>
<p>—…Really?</p>
<p>Evandel looked surprised, which was unsurprising considering how difficult it must have been for her to make this decision.</p>
<p>—Really, really?</p>
<p>“Of course. Have I ever lied to you? Listen to Master Ah Hae-In and work hard. I’ll go see you next week.”</p>
<p>—…Un! Okay!</p>
<p>Evandel smiled brightly and nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m a bit busy. I’ll call you when I’m done.”</p>
<p>—Okay!</p>
<p>Evandel’s lively voice refreshed my ears.</p>
<p>“So cute.”</p>
<p>I smiled and hung up the call.</p>
<p>Boss and Jain’s gazes were a bit bothersome, but I ignored them with a cough.</p>
<p>“Kuhum, alright, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“…You sure are close to her.”</p>
<p>Boss’ voice carried a little bit of jealousy.</p>
<p>“She’s a kid.”</p>
<p>“…Anyways, let’s get going.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>10 minutes later.</p>
<p>I entered the residence first and the shadowfied Boss entered after me. Since Jain would walk in casually at a later point, the two of us made our move first.</p>
<p>“Should we kill her or imprison her?”</p>
<p>“We don’t need to kill her since it might alert someone. We’ll imprison as planned.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>I took out two 8-star cards, [Isolated Prison] and [Soundless Space].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Isolated Prison] [8-star]＊Effective Good＊</p>
<p>—Imprisons a target in an isolated space.</p>
<p>—The imprisoned target will be separated from the rest of the world and will maintain the physical condition before being imprisoned.</p>
<p>—The target can destroy the prison and escape.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Isolated Prison] [7-star]＊Effective Good＊</p>
<p>—When activated, all sound within a 1km radius will be annihilated.</p>
<p>—This card can be destroyed by an impact above a certain level.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Soundless Space] was a bit more direct, but [Isolated Prison] was a bit more complicated because of its unique imprisoning mechanism.</p>
<p>—The imprisoned target will maintain the physical condition before being imprisoned.</p>
<p>In other words, if a target was placed inside the prison with a fatal injury, the injury wouldn’t heal or worsen during the time the target is imprisoned. So we just had to beat up Pleron and trap her inside.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>We moved soundlessly thanks to the [Soundless Space] card.</p>
<p>Pleron was sleeping in her bedroom at the top of the lord’s residence, and I easily maneuvered through any traps using my eyes.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>After arriving close to the bedroom door, we hid behind the wall. Two guards were keeping watch. Boss and I exchanged glances and quickly made our moves.</p>
<p>I shot five arrows, piercing the eyes, heart, head, leg of the guard on the left.</p>
<p>Boss handled the right guard, slicing up his bodies with her shadow blade.</p>
<p>I immediately activated the 8-star card, [Isolated Prison], trapping the two guards before they could mutter a single sound.</p>
<p>“…Hi~”</p>
<p>Jain appeared at the perfect time, disguised a humanoid monster. The three of us then went into Pleron’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Pleron was sleeping on her large bed. Jain carefully approached her and touched me.</p>
<p>“Perfect.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Hearing her voice, Pleron woke up. The first thing she saw was someone who looked just like her. It was, of course, the disguised Jain.</p>
<p>“…Pieek! Who are you!”</p>
<p>Pleron exclaimed. Her magic power shot out and cooled the surrounding temperature. Boss quickly sliced Pleron’s wings with ‘Kurukuru’s Scythe’.</p>
<p>“Pieeek!”</p>
<p>Pleron screamed but [Soundless Space] prevented her voice from leaking out. Everything was going according to plans.</p>
<p>“Pieeeek!”</p>
<p>Boss dealt a fatal injury to Pleron, and I activated [Isolated Prison] once again.</p>
<p>With this, Pleron was sucked into the prison, leaving behind no trace of her existence.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>‘Bullet Time’ forcefully activated.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>The world suddenly slowed down. I could feel the movement of the air around me.</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes and checked for any signs of danger. It didn’t take long for me to see a current of magic power slowly descended from the ceiling.</p>
<p>A ‘magic power explosion’.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a normal explosion. This powerful explosion caused by unnaturally condensed magic power exploding was something neither me, Boss, nor Jain could easily endure.</p>
<p>I quickly tried to activate [Time Reversal].</p>
<p>But at that moment, a strange phenomenon entered my eyes.</p>
<p>“What….”</p>
<p>A golden current erupted with the magic power explosion. I knew very well what this phenomenon was.</p>
<p>‘Narrow Escape from Death’. My luck was guiding me to this explosion, telling me not to use Time Reversal.</p>
<p>[Narrow Escape from Death (6/9) – special stat, accumulation of luck, becomes partly unlocked!]</p>
<p>[It’s a momentary misfortune for the ideal ending.]</p>
<p>The moment I read the alert, I threw myself into the center of the golden current.</p>
<p>“Hajin…”</p>
<p>Boss tried to grab me.</p>
<p><em>Boom—!</em></p>
<p>But an explosion erupted.</p>
<p>I blacked out.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Tk, tk, tk.</p>
<p>The sound of a campfire rang out.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Boss regained consciousness after blacking out momentarily.</p>
<p>A strange scene was reflected before her eyes.</p>
<p>“…Hey, Byul.”</p>
<p>The man she had been looking to kill for years, Bell, was now in front of her.</p>
<p>He was holding Kim Hajin over his shoulders.</p>
<p>Blood quickly rushed to Boss’ head.</p>
<p>“Be…”</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to move or talk. I made that explosion from a part of my body. Even you will be incapacitated for 30 minutes. You should know how strong I am, right?”</p>
<p>Bell smiled bitterly as he said that.</p>
<p>“Anyhow, I’m touched. He tried to protect you guys.”</p>
<p>Bell glanced at Kim Hajin, who was sprawled over his shoulders.</p>
<p>The moment he ignited his magic power, Kim Hajin reacted earlier than anyone else and threw himself forward. He was undoubtedly trying to protect Byul.</p>
<p>And thanks to Kim Hajin’s sacrifice, Byul and Jain only ended up being paralyzed.</p>
<p>“I’m tearing up.”</p>
<p>“…Bell.”</p>
<p>Boss growled and glared at Bell.</p>
<p>Blood flowed from her eyes as she barely managed to eek out his name.</p>
<p>She clenched her teeth and emitted deep-rooted rage and killing intent.</p>
<p>“I’ll take Kim Hajin with me. There’s a lot I need to discuss with him.”</p>
<p>Bell was as leisurely as ever.</p>
<p>“Be…ll….”</p>
<p>Boss reached forward. Her vision was dyed red, but she didn’t give up. She commanded her limbs with all her effort, ‘Move, move, move…!’</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I didn’t kill him. I don’t plan to either.”</p>
<p>“Let him….”</p>
<p>By the time her hand touched the ground after tremendous effort, Bell had already turned his back on her.</p>
<p>At the same time, humanoid monsters who noticed the commotion flooded in.</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to stay with him forever anyways.”</p>
<p>Boss moved her legs as Bell continued talking. She stepped forward with her broken ankle and forced her broken knees to stand.</p>
<p>Like a wooden puppet, she staggered up in a strange pose.</p>
<p>“…Let him go.”</p>
<p>Boss spoke. But that was all she could say. Bell looked back at her eyes and gave a faint smile.</p>
<p>“Sorry this happened again.”</p>
<p>With that Bell jumped down from the mansion. Boss tried to follow him, but her body refused to move. After taking Bell’s attack head-on, her body was screaming to get rest.</p>
<p>“Keruk! What happened!? Keruk! Who are you!?”</p>
<p>Plus, humanoid monsters had already arrived. Boss continued to glare at the direction Bell disappeared to…</p>
<p><em>Thud—!</em></p>
<p>Then, she collapsed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 291. Looking Back (1)</p>
<p>Last night’s attack on the lord’s mansion caused a commotion in Lupiton.</p>
<p>Most of the guards, who weren’t even aware of the infiltration, were ousted and replaced by the smarter and stronger monsters sent down by higher authorities. The effect of the incident was so great that Monster King Orden even enclosed a personal letter to Pleron. In it, he delivered words of encouragement and praised Pleron for her prompt countermeasures. Any servant would have been honored to receive such a letter from their king.</p>
<p>“…Hm. Yeah?”</p>
<p>Amidst all the chaos, Cheok Jungyeong entered the lord’s mansion. No one was there to stop him as he walked down the hallway.</p>
<p>“Explosion, you say…. Geez, you guys are nothing without me,” Cheok Jungyeong muttered as he looked down at Boss who was lying in bed.</p>
<p>“It’s not that we’re weak, “ Jain remarked bitterly, “Bell’s too strong.”</p>
<p>The public considered either Chae Joochul or Heynckes as the strongest man of the present era, but that was because they didn’t know about the relationship between Bell and ‘Shin Myungchul’, who was revered by all as the strongest Hero in the history of mankind.</p>
<p>“Anyways, this dude is pretty good at writing. His servant probably wrote it for him, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Jain gave a small smile as she read Orden’s letter. At the time of the explosion, Jain had lost her consciousness momentarily, yet her ‘disguise’ remained intact. It wasn’t only because she was the farthest from the impact, but also because her Gift wasn’t easily canceled to begin with.</p>
<p>“It’s Hajin, so I’m sure he’ll manage somehow.”</p>
<p>Jain put Orden’s letter away and transformed back to Pleron. She was quite fond of the ice wings that she could control freely.</p>
<p>“…You’re calm.”</p>
<p>In contrast to Jain’s carefree demeanor, Cheok Jungeyong appeared discontent.</p>
<p>“So, are you looking for Bell?”</p>
<p>“Of course. Everyone thinks Bell is the terrorist. I told them Bell came alone. I even fluttered my wings for authenticity~” Jain smiled.</p>
<p>Pleron, Lupiton’s village lord, was currently locked up in Kim Hajin’s card jail, so the entire village now belonged to Jain.</p>
<p>“I even had a composite sketch made. My monster servants will find him in no time~”</p>
<p>“…Uk.”</p>
<p>As Jain asserted with a smile, Boss suddenly made a sound.</p>
<p>“Ah, Boss!”</p>
<p>“Boss, are you awake?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jain looked down at Boss.</p>
<p>Boss tossed and turned in discomfort before finally opening her eyes.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Suddenly Boss’ upper body bounced upward like a spring.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa, haa….”</p>
<p>Boss gasped for air, and Jain approached Boss worriedly.</p>
<p>“Boss, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“…Is it you, Jain?”</p>
<p>Boss frowned at Jain who was disguised as Pleron.</p>
<p>“Yup. It’s me.”</p>
<p>Jain untransformed her face.</p>
<p>“I see. …Huu.”</p>
<p>Boss closed her eyes and recalled all the things that had happened before she lost consciousness. She quickly grasped all the events that had led up to their current situation.</p>
<p>Their attack on Pleron, Bell’s subsequent ambush, and Kim Hajin’s abduction.</p>
<p>She felt an unimaginable amount of rage from that last memory.</p>
<p>“…Bell.”</p>
<p>With clenched teeth, Boss looked at Jain. The swelled up blood vessels in the white of her eyes were about to burst from anger.</p>
<p>“Bell. Where is that son of a bitch?”</p>
<p>“We’re looking for him.”</p>
<p>“…And Hajin?”</p>
<p>“Same goes for Hajin.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Boss put on a strange expression.</p>
<p>Her face crumpled in sadness, and fear and sorrow replaced the anger in her eyes. She was truly worried for someone. Jain had never seen Boss like this before.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry~ He’s the type to thrive no matter where he is~”</p>
<p>Despite Jain’s attempt to comfort her, Boss’ expression remained the same. The situation worsened the next moment when Boss began to blame herself. Jain felt sorry for Boss. She reluctantly glanced at Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“Boss~ Cheok Jungyeong says that he found an ‘underground village’.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong flinched, and Boss raised her head to look at Jain.</p>
<p>“Underground village?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s a village made up of the members of the Resistance or something. According to Jungyeong, Kim Suho, Jin Seyeon, and everyone else is there~”</p>
<p>Boss usually wasn’t interested in Heroes, but Kim Suho was an exception. People had been saying that the Swordsman of Wish would become the youngest Master-rank Hero in history.</p>
<p>“Do you want to go visit them~?” Jain asked.</p>
<p>Boss frowned, deep in thought, but now was the time to grasp any straws available.</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>She finally nodded.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the underground village in Lupiton.</p>
<p>“…We’ve obtained information about Tigris’ travel route.”</p>
<p>Their mission was well underway.</p>
<p>Although Lupiton’s surveillance heightened after last night’s incident, the number of Resistance members also increased proportionally. They felt they had nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>“So, Tigris will be giving a speech in ‘Doloren Square’?” Aileen asked. She had secretly arrived here last night. In all seriousness, Aileen stared at the document outlining Tigris’ travel route.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we’ll stay put while he’s giving the speech. We strike after his speech when he’s leaving the square to go somewhere else.” Ellio explained the mission that he devised with Yi Gongmyoung. “The most important piece of this mission is Tigris’ horse.”</p>
<p>“Horse?”</p>
<p>“Yes. He’s called ‘Horseless’. He’s known to be violent towards everyone other than his owner. Tigris is extremely fond of this horse. Rumor has it that he even loves him.” Ellio showed Aileen a photo of the horse.</p>
<p>Horseless was beautiful; his white mane was in striking contrast with his pitch black body. Aileen couldn’t imagine him being violent. That’s why Ellio’s next words were shocking.</p>
<p>“Horseless eats humans.”</p>
<p>“…What? Humans?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he consumes them, quite literally.”</p>
<p>Ellio showed her more photos. In them, Horseless was chewing on a human arm. Tigris was watching him contently in the background.</p>
<p>“He’s nuts.”</p>
<p>“Tigris rides Horseless wherever he goes.”</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>“Even among the monsters, General Tigris is notorious for his temper. He pretends to be kind and generous but he’s actually very violent and cruel. He is the type who can’t hold back his anger.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, I see where you’re going with this.”</p>
<p>Aileen was still confused, but Jin Seyeon nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“You’re planning to murder Horseless.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. If Horseless dies, Tigris will lose his temper for sure. Tigris is known to slay his own comrades when things go awry. So, can you imagine the things he would do when he sees his horse get murdered before his eyes?” Ellio gave a small smile. “He will become mad to the point he can’t tell right from wrong. Tigris will go on a rampage, destroying any and everything that comes into his line of sight. When he finishes killing all of his guards, that’s when we jump in to annihilate him.”</p>
<p>This was the best case scenario that Ellio and Yi Gongmyoung came up with.</p>
<p>“That sounds like a good plan. Leave Horseless to me, then.”</p>
<p>Ellio nodded at Jin Seyeon’s remark. To the Divine Archer, killing a horse would be a simple task.</p>
<p>“…Then I’ll take on Tigris.” Kim Suho announced all of a sudden. He looked around the village hall with a serious look.</p>
<p>Aileen frowned. “Hey, I’m the Commander, not you! And one particular person isn’t in charge of Tigris. Together we’ll all-”</p>
<p>“You know he’s invincible unless we fight him at close quarters. You've all seen the video from the Chinese government.”</p>
<p>Through the video, Kim Suho witnessed all the heinous crimes that Tigris had committed. Tigris killed a countless number of civilians and Heroes for pleasure. He didn’t even budge while committing a massacre that would go down in history.</p>
<p>Kim Suho could neither understand nor forgive such evil deeds.</p>
<p>“Please let me take him on.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was determined. The Sword Saint wished to cut down Tigris’ madness.</p>
<p>Aileen stared at Kim Suho for a while, and… nodded.</p>
<p>“…Okay, fine. But only because it's better to minimize the number of Heroes in a mission. But I'll be watching you and we’ll intervene as soon as things get out of hand.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded with a big smile.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the door of the village hall burst open and the high-rank Hero, Seo Youngji, rushed inside.</p>
<p>“Commander Aileen! The Chameleon Troupe is here!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Please come on out!”</p>
<p>Aileen jumped to her feet and hurried outside.</p>
<p>“Where, where?”</p>
<p>“Over there.”</p>
<p>Seo Youngji pointed at the entrance of the village.</p>
<p>Three people were there, indeed.</p>
<p>But Black Lotus wasn’t one of them.</p>
<p>Aileen tilted her head in confusion, and the Chameleon Troupe’s boss stopped in front of Aileen.</p>
<p>“…What happened?”</p>
<p>Aileen asked.</p>
<p>“We….”</p>
<p>Boss opened her mouth to answer but stopped when she ‘detected’ a certain gaze on her.</p>
<p>She looked at the owner of the gaze.</p>
<p>“…That woman.”</p>
<p>“What? That woman?”</p>
<p>That woman wasn’t supposed to be here.</p>
<p>She was the bait to lure Bell in.</p>
<p>It was ‘Jin Sahyuk’.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shuddered when her gaze met Boss’. Boss moved immediately. There was not a single moment of hesitation in her movement.</p>
<p>As she watched Boss charge towards her like a ray of light— Jin Sahyuk smiled leisurely.</p>
<p>“I’m used to things like this now.”</p>
<p>She’d gotten beat up too many times to be surprised.</p>
<p>She gracefully emitted her magic power to form a barrier around her to prepare for the upcoming impact.</p>
<p><em>Crack—</em></p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>But Boss’ punch easily pierced through her barrier.</p>
<p>“Wha…?”</p>
<p>The punch landed on Jin Sahyuk’s right cheek.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh—</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk flew and slammed against a wall.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England — Borand Forest]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite all the commotion that was happening in Africa, Evandel, Ah Hae-In, and Rachel arrived at a forest in England, along with Hayang.</p>
<p>“Wow….”</p>
<p>They were in a ‘rank-1 danger zone’ called Borand Forest.</p>
<p>“Evandel, do you remember what you need to do first in order to establish a personal domain?” Ah Hae-In asked inside a forest full of monsters above high-intermediate rank.</p>
<p>Evandel, who was in her training uniform, wondered for a moment before finally shouting, “You have to grasp the nature within the domain!”</p>
<p>“Mn. You’re wrong.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In shook her head.</p>
<p>Evandel was confused but soon came up with another answer.</p>
<p>“Then… you have to befriend the nature within the domain!”</p>
<p>“How? How do you befriend it?”</p>
<p>“Um… That’s….”</p>
<p>Evandel glanced at Rachel, seeking her help.</p>
<p>“…hu… uu, hu….”</p>
<p>However, Rachel was already preoccupied with the sorrow of her upcoming breakup. Evandel held Rachel’s hand gently.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to try so hard. That answer was wrong, too.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In smiled and stroked Evandel’s head.</p>
<p>“The first and foremost thing you should do before establishing a personal domain is…”</p>
<p>She raised her head and looked out into the surrounding nature.</p>
<p>The grass, trees, and streams were all full of magic power. This land would make an excellent ‘magician’s domain’.</p>
<p>“…buying the land.”</p>
<p>“…Ehh?”</p>
<p>Of course, children were oblivious to such grown-up interests.</p>
<p>Evandel blinked a few times in confusion.</p>
<p>“First, you have to make this land legally yours. Even magicians need to abide by the law, after all.”</p>
<p>“Mm… Then….”</p>
<p>“But there’s no need for you to worry, Evandel.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In twisted her words again. Evandel frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“From here to there, all the land has already been purchased by Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>“…Ah?”</p>
<p>Evandel’s eyebrows wiggled.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In beamed.</p>
<p>Though, to be precise, this land wasn’t purchased by Kim Hajin. It was purchased with Kim Hajin’s ‘money’. So far Kim Hajin had paid her a total of 40 billion won for Evandel’s lessons. With it, Ah Hae-In had purchased this land in Kim Hajin’s name.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to begin?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Evandel nodded with a big smile.</p>
<p>“Good. Now, don’t hold back, and summon your beasts.”</p>
<p>“Whew….”</p>
<p>Evandel closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Then she sat on the grass, emitting her unique magic power signature.</p>
<p>The message embedded in the signature was ‘Come to me.’</p>
<p>“Your next task is simple. You’ll consolidate this land with the help of your spirit beasts. As you live in nature with your spirit beasts and as you create new ones, make this land acknowledge you as its rightful owner.”</p>
<p>Evandel nodded with both her eyes shut tightly.</p>
<p>She focused on emitting her magic power signature for the next five minutes.</p>
<p>Vibrations and noise came from far away.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of spirit beasts that Evandel had released were returning to her.</p>
<p>“They’re coming.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Both Ah Hae-In and Rachel waited for the wave of spirit beasts to appear.</p>
<p>Uuuuu… The faint vibration soon became a loud roar.</p>
<p>Amidst the majestic sound of footsteps that filled the air and the earth, the two adults were overwhelmed as they witnessed Evandel’s spirit beasts approach them from a distance.</p>
<p>Spirit beasts surrounded Evandel. Rabbits, lions, tigers, horses, hippopotamuses, wolves…. Countless spirit beasts formed a giant circle around Evandel.</p>
<p>One would be lucky to witness such a spectacle even once during one's lifetime.</p>
<p>“…Now, open your eyes.”</p>
<p>Evandel opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She looked at the spirit beasts around her and smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>“Let them roam around freely. Your spirit beasts will consolidate your domain for you.”</p>
<p>“Okee!”</p>
<p>Evandel set her spirit beasts free.</p>
<p><em>Tudududu—</em></p>
<p><em>Hiiing—</em></p>
<p>The footsteps, the roars, the fluttering of wings.</p>
<p>Her spirit beasts jumped into the air and ran along the earth, leaving their marks all across the surrounding nature.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I woke up in a dark room. I could feel a soft mattress under me.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>For a moment, I blinked a few times and assessed the situation. Immediately, I was filled with confusion. I remembered getting swept up in a huge explosion. But I wasn’t hurt. In fact, my head felt clearer than ever.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the Orb of Regeneration, but it was still strange how refreshed I felt.</p>
<p>Was it because I got a good amount of sleep? Or was this also due to my luck?</p>
<p>“You’re awake.”</p>
<p>A voice disturbed my train of thought. I tilted my head slightly to the side. There, I saw a handsome man who looked like Legolas from the Lord of the Rings, smoking cigar.</p>
<p>“…It’s you again.”</p>
<p>I knew this man.</p>
<p>Bell.</p>
<p>But there was no hint of hostility in his eyes. The way he opened his eyes wearily made him appear quite attractive, actually.</p>
<p>“What’s your deal this time?” I asked.</p>
<p>Bell spoke slowly, stroking dark circles under his eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah, nothing big. I just looked at your memories… with my ultimate skill. For 10 minutes or so.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“It turns out I can’t keep it up for longer than 10 minutes. Your memories are just too complex. So I only saw bits here and there. Ah, it’s not like I have a voyeurism fetish.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I-”</p>
<p>I frowned.</p>
<p>I had killed Bell once in the Tower of Wish. I still clearly remembered how I fired my gun into his head.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was impossible for him to have a ultimate skill.</p>
<p>“DIdn’t I kill you once in the Tower?”</p>
<p>“…Ah~ Right, that happened. But you can’t kill me. My body is made up of magic power, thanks to my Authority [Magic Power Body]. Haam~”</p>
<p>Bell yawned and stretched at the same time.</p>
<p>“No…, but I did kill you.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm? Ah~ You’re right. Your anti-magic power did break my ‘magic power’. But it couldn’t destroy my Authority.”</p>
<p>“Mm… Tell me more.”</p>
<p>“Haha,” Bell laughed aloud and continued with his explanation, “I’m saying that you should just consider me ‘nature’. This world has already recognized me as a part of nature. Just like how wind blows, rain falls, and flowers bloom, I too am a part of nature. So when I die, nature automatically rearranges my existence. This phenomenon is only possible because I am entirely made up of magic power.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“In short, I can’t die. I’m bound to live forever.”</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Magic Power Body was indeed in my original settings, though eventually I got rid of it because it felt overpowered.</p>
<p>But still, ‘resurrection’ was never a part of Magic Power Body.</p>
<p>When I turned my doubtful gaze to Bell, he smiled at me.</p>
<p>“By the way, aren’t you curious about the fact that I looked at your memories?”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>My heart sank.</p>
<p>The fact he looked at my memories meant that Bell now knew all of my secrets.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s how you should respond.”</p>
<p>Bell smirked and sat down next to me.</p>
<p>“I never imagined there’d be another Transmigrator other than Jin Sahyuk and Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>“…Transmigrator?”</p>
<p>What Bell said was strange.</p>
<p>At first I was confused, but I soon realized that he had interpreted my memories in a completely different way.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Transmigrator. Kim Hajin and Kim Chundong are the same yet completely different people. That’s the reason Jin Sahyuk thought you were her servant. Kim Chundong, whose body you took over, became Jin Sahyuk’s servant ‘Kindspring’ in Akatrina.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I understood that much. I also saw the world you’re originally from. Although I couldn’t figure out <em>how</em> you came here, since that information had been blocked securely.”</p>
<p>I said nothing and only stared at Bell.</p>
<p>“Another Earth in a parallel universe. It was a boring yet nonetheless fascinating story.”</p>
<p>Bell smiled leisurely. I looked at Bell’s deep, dark blue eyes.</p>
<p>Just what exactly was this man who was neither in my original novel nor setting?</p>
<p>“…Do you want to know who I am?”</p>
<p>Bell muttered as if he had read my mind.</p>
<p>“Will you give me an answer if I ask?”</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s give and take. I figured out your identity, now you should know mine.”</p>
<p>I looked at Bell as if saying, ‘Then, tell me.’</p>
<p>“Okay. But first, have you heard of ‘Baal’?”</p>
<p>I froze.</p>
<p>Baal.</p>
<p>That was the name of the devil ranked as the first among Solomon’s Seventy-Two Devils. He was the most popular and the most powerful devil of all, along with Satan.</p>
<p>“So you do know. Then you also know that for a devil to descend on Earth, he needs an incarnation body, right?”</p>
<p>Bell smiled.</p>
<p>I listened to Bell in a daze.</p>
<p>“At this point, you probably figured out where I’m going with this. I’m Baal’s incarnation body. I only have six months left at most. In six months, Baal will be born in my head.”</p>
<p>It was a sudden, shocking declaration.</p>
<p>“…So?”</p>
<p>Bell frowned slightly at my nonchalant reaction.</p>
<p>“So? I said, I’m Baal. When I become Baal, the world is doomed. You’ll never be able to kill me.”</p>
<p>“…And?”</p>
<p>Still, I was calm.</p>
<p>The reason was simple. I knew I was here as a result of the [Accumulation of Luck] that happened during the explosion, and I could still see the sentence [This is a momentary misfortune that will lead to the best ending] in my window.</p>
<p>In short, this meeting with Bell was the result of the purest ‘luck’.</p>
<p>“…Ehew.”</p>
<p>Finally, Bell sighed.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll get to the point. But first.”</p>
<p>Bell’s gaze suddenly sharpened.</p>
<p>“…Chundong.”</p>
<p>Bell called Kim Chundong.</p>
<p>He was one of the two people in this world who knew Kim Chundong.</p>
<p>“Kim Chundong.”</p>
<p>Also, he was the only one who witnessed the root of Kim Chundong’s existence.</p>
<p>[In response to the called name, your synchronization with ‘Kim Chundong’ is increasing.]</p>
<p>Something in my heart responded to Bell’s voice.</p>
<p>I glared at Bell, and Bell asked me, “Do you think… you’ll be able to betray Byul just for a second?”</p>
<p>He was asking me if I could betray Boss.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 292. Looking Back (2)</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I raised my body without replying. Meanwhile, Bell continued to talk.</p>
<p>“Demon Realm Transformation is progressing even as we speak. It’s still faint so that humans can’t detect it, but it will soon spread to the heart of Earth.”</p>
<p>The final setting of my story – Demon Realm Transformation. This was the phenomenon where the Demon Realm’s land eroded Earth’s. This meant I was heading towards the end of the story.</p>
<p>“No one can stop Demon Realm Transformation. Because it’s the prelude to the descent of devils.”</p>
<p>For the story to have a happy ending, Kim Suho had to eliminate devils and save humanity.</p>
<p>“If you want to stop Demon Realm Transformation, or in other words, if you want to see the best ‘ending’, you should trust me.”</p>
<p>So I couldn’t help but doubt Bell. Somehow, he was even more confident about the ending of the story than me.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I glared at Bell. Inside the darkness without a single stream of light, Bell received my gaze and smiled leisurely.</p>
<p>“The offer I want to make is simple.”</p>
<p>Bell finished the cigar in his mouth. After a brief silence, he burned it with black magic power. The smoke of the cigar filled the air. Bell spoke inside the acrid smoke.</p>
<p>“Help Sahyuk to kill me.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>My eyebrows furrowed naturally.</p>
<p>But Bell smiled with even greater leisure and continued what seemed like the strangest words.</p>
<p>“I know you and Jin Sahyuk have a complicated relationship… but she’s the only one who can kill me.”</p>
<p>It was then that I realized what seemed so off about Bell.</p>
<p>He didn’t have a ‘desire to live’, which all humans naturally possessed.</p>
<p>Was it because he knew he was Baal’s incarnation body? I couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“…Can’t you just go to Jin Sahyuk and let her kill you? What’s so complicated about it?”</p>
<p>“Ah, if only it was that easy~”</p>
<p>Bell put on a sad expression.</p>
<p>“I want to die. I’ve lived for too long and have no desire to live. But I do have a survival instinct. Instinct is different than desire because this instinct comes from Baal who resides in my head.”</p>
<p>“But didn’t I kill you with ease before?”</p>
<p>When I killed Bell in the Tower of Wish or, as Bell said, killed his body, I felt no signs of Baal.</p>
<p>“I told you, I won’t die even if I’m killed. Baal only reacts when my existence is at risk of ‘annihilation’. When that happens, Baal should shoot out of my head and erupt into a frenzy.”</p>
<p>Bell paused momentarily. Then, he wore a look of reminiscence like he was remembering something from a long time ago.</p>
<p>“…I’ve killed many because of this instinct.”</p>
<p>A sorrowful smile emerged on his face. But his smile soon disappeared, and he continued speaking in his leisurely tone.</p>
<p>“So I want you to help Sahyuk. She can become much stronger than she is now. Help her get stronger so that she can kill me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“If she doesn’t, Baal will destroy Earth once he descends. That’s something neither you, me, nor that Monster King Orden want.”</p>
<p>I still had many questions and doubts. But I knew Bell was mostly telling the truth thanks to the newly upgraded [Observation and Reading].</p>
<p>[Life force 100/100]</p>
<p>[Name – Bell]</p>
<p>[Alignment – Neutral]</p>
<p>[Realm, Potential – Inestimable]</p>
<p>[Status – Being honest]</p>
<p>Of course, being honest didn’t mean he was telling the truth.</p>
<p>I changed the topic before digging deeper into his explanation.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by betraying Boss?”</p>
<p>“Mm? Oh, Byul?” Bell grinned. “If you can find a way to not betray her, then you don’t have to. But….” Bell’s expression turned serious. “I doubt she’ll accept the fact that you’re cooperating with me. Byul resents me for killing Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>Yeonjun. It was yet another name I didn’t know. I frowned.</p>
<p>“…And who’s Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s the Chameleon Troupe’s previous Boss. Byul didn’t tell you, huh. Well, it’s not surprising given how sensitive she is to the topic.”</p>
<p>Bell let out a dry cough.</p>
<p>“Anyways, I’ve told Byul that she would end up betraying you for Yeonjun. I didn’t know things would turn out this way, but it kind of makes sense, doesn’t it? Haha.”</p>
<p>Bell shrugged proudly and acted cutely. It would have been disgusting if he wasn’t so handsome, but in any case, I understood what he meant. In a way, I was the only one who could understand Bell.</p>
<p>He was kind of like me in that he was trying to conclude the story. Bell had chosen Jin Sahyuk for the ending he envisioned, while I had chosen Kim Suho.</p>
<p>One was a growing main character and the other was a growing final boss. But technically, the growing final boss was also one of the protagonists of the story’s latter half.</p>
<p>“Think of yourself as a princess maker. Sahyuk <em>is</em> a princess, after all.”</p>
<p>Bell rested his chin on his hands and stared at me.</p>
<p>“Plus, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Chundong came to be Sahyuk’s servant.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk about Chundong in front of me.”</p>
<p>Synchronization percentage increased every time I heard Kim Chundong’s name. It was already at 10.9%. It wouldn’t be wrong to say my feet now belonged to him.</p>
<p>“Okay, I won’t.”</p>
<p>Bell smiled brightly. He then walked up to me and placed his hands on my shoulders.</p>
<p>“So? Will you do it? If you do, I’ll support you so that Sahyuk can become yours.”</p>
<p>I frowned at the strange connotation in his words.</p>
<p>“…I don’t want Jin Sahyuk to become mine.”</p>
<p>Bell replied casually.</p>
<p>“Just think of it as my dying will.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Underground Resistance Village.</p>
<p>The commotion died down only when the sun set. Cheok Jungyeong and Aileen calmed the Chameleon Troupe’s Boss, who suddenly went berserk, and Jin Sahyuk shuddered at the unjust treatment she received.</p>
<p>“I’m going.”</p>
<p>Although the Heroes present were able to prevent a full-out fight from breaking out, Jin Sahyuk decided to leave the village with hurt feelings. She had no reason to stay since Bell ran away.</p>
<p>“…Here, take this.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was the only one who came to see her off. Kim Suho handed her a bag filled with bento boxes and other dry food that could easily last two weeks.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at Kim Suho unhappily, but she took the bag anyways. She knew how important food was from the last experience she suffered.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I tried to do something about it, but we’re allied with the Chameleon Troupe for now, so…”</p>
<p>“Chameleon Troupe.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned around with the bag under her armpit.</p>
<p>“Don’t trust them. They’re worse than me.”</p>
<p>She then grabbed onto the ladder to the surface. Kim Suho watched Jin Sahyuk climb the ladder. Eventually, he couldn’t help but shout, “OI!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned around. As Kim Suho once served Jin Sahyuk as a knight, he had complicated feelings towards her.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you come for me? You’re just going to leave without fighting me?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at Kim Suho blankly before letting out a small snicker.</p>
<p>“…Bastard, did you develop a crush on me?”</p>
<p>That was it. Jin Sahyuk didn’t say anything else and just disappeared up the ladder.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho still had mixed feelings.</p>
<p>He had settled his past, but Jin Sahyuk was still clearly bound by it. That was why she regarded him as a traitor.</p>
<p>But looking at her back, he didn’t feel good. Though she was a powerless leader, she was still the king he once served.</p>
<p>Aileen approached as Kim Suho fell in thought.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about someone like her. Tigris will be coming in two days.”</p>
<p>Aileen crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“The rehearsal is starting soon, so follow me.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded and slowly turned around. He then trudged towards the village hall with Aileen.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Two days later, in Doloren Square located in the heart of Lupiton.</p>
<p>“I will say this again. We will be victorious—!”</p>
<p>Both humans and humanoid monsters gathered at Doloren Square where Tigris’s voice rang out. His roar shook heaven and earth, and his speech ended with loud applause from everyone.</p>
<p>“Great, Lupiton is satisfactory.”</p>
<p>Tigris nodded contently before walking down from the podium.</p>
<p>“Lord Tigris, Lord Tigris.”</p>
<p>At that moment, an ant humanoid monster walked up to him.</p>
<p>“Village Lord Pleron would like to invite you to a banquet.”</p>
<p>“No need. She should be satisfied seeing my face here. I don’t want to waste any more time. Rather than that, where’s Horseless?”</p>
<p>“Ah, Lord Horseless is enjoying a nap at the moment.”</p>
<p>Tigris’s secretary didn’t forget to address Horseless with respect. He knew dozens of humanoid monsters who were beheaded for addressing Horseless casually.</p>
<p>“We’ve been quite busy lately, so he must be tired. Thankfully, tomorrow is the last day.”</p>
<p>Tigris headed to the mansion Horseless was sleeping in. Following him were 66 rank-1 humanoid monsters, who were all elites equivalent in strength to high-rank grade-1 Heroes.</p>
<p>“Mm, there he is.”</p>
<p>Tigris arrived at the well-decorated stable built just for Horseless. It was full of beautiful and rare plants and flowers.</p>
<p>“Horseless!”</p>
<p>Horseless instantly reacted to Tigris’s voice.</p>
<p>—Hiiing!</p>
<p>“Hahaha, you wanted to see me too?”</p>
<p>Tigris embraced Horseless who ran into his arms. They were only separated for four hours, yet they acted as though they were reunited after years.</p>
<p>Tigris, who was stroking Horseless’s mane, suddenly heard Horseless’s whisper. Tigris stood frozen for a moment, then nodded his head.</p>
<p>“…Oi, did you feed this child?”</p>
<p>Tigris asked the human who was in charge of the stable.</p>
<p>“Yes, we served him the best food available.”</p>
<p>“And what was that?”</p>
<p>“T-That’s….”</p>
<p>The human didn’t answer, but Tigris wasn’t expecting to hear one. Tigris immediately crushed the human’s head, turning him into pulp.</p>
<p>“…Fool.”</p>
<p>Tigris glanced at the corpse then hopped on Horseless. Horseless greeted his owner with a happy expression.</p>
<p>“Make sure to prepare proper meat in the next village. Otherwise, you will be the next to die.”</p>
<p>Tigris’s solemn warning caused all his servants to bow.</p>
<p>“Let’s go!”</p>
<p><em>Tk, tk.</em></p>
<p>Horseless’s clear galloping sound rang out as Tigris marched forward.</p>
<p>Lupiton’s residents sent him unconditional applauses, and Tigris left the village feeling content.</p>
<p>“I can’t get used to seeing humans all happy. If it wasn’t for King Orden… don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>Tigris grumbled viciously the moment he left the village.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am always amazed by Lord Tigris’s patience and virtue.”</p>
<p>The ant secretary eagerly played along with Tigris.</p>
<p>The group slowly headed to their next destination and soon reached a vast wilderness.</p>
<p>“Huaaaam—!’</p>
<p>Tigris yawned, which sounded more like a roar.</p>
<p>“What villages are left?”</p>
<p>“Crean and Loren. Crean is a low-rank village and Loren is a mid-rank…?”</p>
<p>Just as the ant secretary was reciting their itinerary, an arrow-like object flashed in the sky.</p>
<p><em>Paaaang—!</em></p>
<p>A huge wind pressure fiercely swallowed the surrounding air. This came from Tigris’s punch. He had immediately tried to eliminate the object that was targeting Horseless.</p>
<p>However, the Divine Archer’s arrow wasn’t so easily broken. It multiplied like a spider web and assaulted Tigris and Horseless.</p>
<p><em>Whish—!</em></p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s magic arrow bound Tigris’s arm, then dug further down to pierce Horseless’s heart.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Immediately, Tigris fell forward. Although he landed safely, the same couldn’t be said for Horseless.</p>
<p>With his heart destroyed by a fatal arrow, Horseless fell to the side helplessly.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>When Tigris saw Horseless, his thoughts stopped. He ran up to him in a daze, moving only by instinct.</p>
<p>—Hi…iing…</p>
<p>Horseless was gasping for air. Looking at his beloved owner, he was letting out his final breaths, struggling to live.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>But it wasn’t long until his breathing stopped. The horse died with its eyes open. Tigris stared at his beloved horse in a frozen state. He felt like he was dreaming. Everything felt surreal, and his brain refused to accept the current situation as reality.</p>
<p>“This… what….”</p>
<p>The ant secretary slowly approached Tigris. He could only see Tigris’s back, which was trembling unnaturally.</p>
<p>“Um… Lord Tig…”</p>
<p>The ant secretary couldn’t finish his sentence.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>Tigris roared, his voice full of rage and uncontrollable madness. He stood up and glared at his servants. His tearful eyes had already lost focus.</p>
<p>Drowning in rage, Tigris turned into a beast that acted on its instinctive desire to destroy.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jin Sahyuk walked deeper into Africa. She came to Africa to find Bell, but now she had an additional goal.</p>
<p>Training to become stronger.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk felt she had been too lazy lately. She felt especially powerless after fighting the so-called boss of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk walked through Africa, chasing after the scent Bell purposefully left behind. If any monster or humanoid monster dared to hinder her, she simply killed them.</p>
<p>“Hm… Was this what Bell was aiming for?”</p>
<p>And the current result was this.</p>
<p>Thousands of monsters and humanoid monsters were surrounding her.</p>
<p>The fight was well underway. Jin Sahyuk released countless weapons that shred the lives of monsters, and a mountain of corpses began to build up. However, there was seemingly no end to the number of monsters.</p>
<p>“Give up, Jin Sahyuk, kereuk.”</p>
<p>A humanoid monster resembling a drake spoke. He seemed to be the commander of the army.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“You know my name?”</p>
<p>“Kereuk. Of course, you became the King’s servant, yet betrayed him and ran away after just one week.”</p>
<p>“…Oh, you’re talking about that?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had received Akatrina’s crystal from Orden, but she didn’t remember becoming his servant. Jin Sahyuk made a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Are you prepared to die, kereuk?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk checked her physical condition without answering. She had been pushing herself for the past month without proper rest, so she couldn’t say she was in excellent condition. In fact, it was below average due to the fight two days earlier.</p>
<p>“Are <em>you</em> ready to die?”</p>
<p>But just as expected, Jin Sahyuk pushed herself into a corner. Pushing herself to overcome her limits was how she planned to get stronger. Jin Sahyuk was confident in her potential.</p>
<p>“Kereuk, foolish human—!”</p>
<p>The drake shouted and spat out a fireball.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk jumped up to dodge the attack, but flying monsters quickly charged towards her. Jin Sahyuk manipulated the air current and strangled them to death.</p>
<p>“…How do you lot breed so quickly?”</p>
<p>The humanoid monsters and monster birds’ attacks continued.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had limited magic power, yet the option of escaping never entered her brain.</p>
<p>The endless fight left numerous scars on Jin Sahyuk’s body. Her bleeding never ceased, her armor torn, and her hair cut. Overcoming the situation seemed to be the farthest thing from reach, as the situation only worsened as time passed.</p>
<p>It was then. As Jin Sahyuk continued to lead a solitary battle…</p>
<p>“Kereuk! Die, traitor…?”</p>
<p>An arrow struck the throat of the roaring drake. The arrow then shot up and pierced the drake’s head.</p>
<p>“…Kereeeuk.”</p>
<p>The drake died, but the mysterious arrow was only getting started.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa—</em></p>
<p>A total of five black arrows came flying through the sky. They drew black traces in the air and moved like five autonomous birds.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at the arrows in a daze. The arrows moved at an incomprehensible speed, taking the lives of numerous monsters. The lines drawn by the arrows resembled something out of a modern art museum.</p>
<p>Kuak, keuk, guuuk—!</p>
<p>Monsters fell one-by-one. The death toll reached two-digits, three-digits, then four-digits.</p>
<p>All this happened in less than 3 seconds.</p>
<p>“…Who is it.”</p>
<p>When Jin Sahyuk asked, the owner of the arrows showed himself without a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>“Over here.”</p>
<p>The voice came from above. Jin Sahyuk looked up.</p>
<p>On a nameless mountain, the man she was looking for along with Bell was standing there.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows, while Kim Hajin spoke expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“Come up.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin explained to the confused Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“For the next six months…”</p>
<p>Then, he nocked another arrow on his bow. This one was a pure white arrow that clearly contrasted with his previous black arrows. Although Jin Sahyuk had no way of knowing this arrow’s identity, it was the mythical [Lv.11 Athena’s Moonlight Arrow].</p>
<p>“I’ll be by your side.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin finished his sentence, but Jin Sahyuk didn’t understand him for a long time. Three seconds? Five seconds? Once the words sank in, Jin Sahyuk’s eyes quickly widened, and Kim Hajin let go of his bowstring.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Athena’s Moonlight Arrow, infused with Stigma’s magic power, erupted with a huge, pure current and shot towards the army of monsters.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 293. Looking Back (3)</p>
<p>The purest light amplified by Stigma, an arrow that the Greek goddess of wisdom used. [Lv.11 Athena’s Moonlight Arrow] flew silently, devouring both the sky and earth.</p>
<p>As the arrow flew across the sky, the world turned white. All the nearby monsters were burnt alive by the overwhelming moonlight. Though it was still afternoon, the sky became dark, as moonlight only shone in the dark.</p>
<p>“…Come up here.”</p>
<p>I hastened Jin Sahyuk who was staring at me. She still looked confused, but I didn’t have a lot of time to spare.</p>
<p>“I’m going to leave you behind if you don’t.”</p>
<p><em>Guooo….</em></p>
<p>At that moment, the footsteps of yet another army of monsters rang out from beyond the horizon. Startled by the sound, Jin Sahyuk glanced at the horizon, then looked at me, then jumped high and landed on the cliff where I was standing.</p>
<p>“What’s with you? Why did you suddenly come here, and….”</p>
<p>I let Jin Sahyuk babble to herself and activated my spirit power.</p>
<p>I focused my spirit power on ‘movement’, set the coordinates in my head, and mimicked Khalifa’s Gift, ‘Portal’. Because I had used up almost all streaks of Stigma during the last attack, I no longer had any left to use for the portal.</p>
<p><em>Psssst….</em></p>
<p>My spirit power created a ‘portal’. I grabbed Jin Sahyuk and pushed her inside. Then I followed her.</p>
<p>We arrived at a dark cave on the coast of Africa.</p>
<p>“…You bastard, you were the one who kicked me out. So why did you come to me?”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Jin Sahyuk grabbed me by the collar.</p>
<p>But I only looked at her in the eye.</p>
<p>“What, you’re just gonna ignore me? Huh? Is that it?”</p>
<p>Bell had told me a lot about Jin Sahyuk, about the life she had to live on Earth after her death in Akatrina, what path she took to get here, and about the agony and the pain she had to live through.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kim Hajin! Kim— Hajin! Kim— Ha— Jin—!”</p>
<p>When I heard Bell, I felt hopeful that maybe the ending of my novel could change.</p>
<p>In my novel, Jin Sahyuk was an unforgivable villain and a hopeless tyrant. But in this world, she changed because she met ‘Bell’, a character who didn’t exist in my original story.</p>
<p>“Are you deaf or something?”</p>
<p>I didn’t trust Bell completely, of course. I still had a lot of doubts about him, and he clearly had many secrets I needed to dig up.</p>
<p>But none of that mattered right now. I wasn’t worried at all.</p>
<p>After all, I had the ‘Book of Truth’ with me.</p>
<p>“Answer me—!”</p>
<p>It was then that Jin Sahyuk started to shake me side to side. My body swayed like a doll made out of paper because of her enormous strength.</p>
<p>I answered nonchalantly, “It's only natural for a servant to be with his king, right?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk froze.</p>
<p>Her hands were still around my neck when she coldly muttered, “…That’s bullshit.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
<p>I could tell she was extremely suspicious of me.</p>
<p>‘Kindspring’ and ‘Kim Hajin’.</p>
<p>She was torn between the two existences.</p>
<p>“Anyways, I’ve decided to train you in place of Bell for the next six months, or shorter if possible.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s grip tightened all of a sudden.</p>
<p>“Training? Cut the crap. You’ve met Bell? What did you two talk about?”</p>
<p>“Well…. Can you let go of me first?”</p>
<p>I looked down at my collar. Jin Sahyuk’s grip was so tight that, frankly, I couldn’t move at all. I felt as if my whole body had been bound, even though all she was doing was holding me by my collar. The difference in our base stats was too high.</p>
<p>“Why would I—”</p>
<p>“Let go.”</p>
<p>I scowled. Jin Sahyuk, however, did not loosen her grip and only stared at me. There wasn’t a single trace of fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>‘…A while ago she couldn’t even speak properly in front of me.’</p>
<p>“…Do you think I’m a joke just because I’ve been going easy on you these past few months?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk clenched her teeth and didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Well, now was the time to set the records straight.</p>
<p>I only had one streak of Stigma left, but I was still confident I would win. As long as I had [Fate], I would never lose to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Let go of me before I count to three.”</p>
<p>I held three fingers up.</p>
<p>“One, two.”</p>
<p>I folded two of them.</p>
<p>“Three.”</p>
<p>And there went the last.</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk’s hands were still around my collar. She smirked.</p>
<p>“Just come at me, you bastard. You think I’ll be scared of you forev-”</p>
<p>I activated [Fate] immediately.</p>
<p>All my stats were increased by 300% and the sensation of absolute power encompassed my entire body. This time [Fate] included [Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration] attached to the Black Lotus Uniform.</p>
<p>My blood began to rush, and my speed increased indefinitely as the world slowed down almost to a stop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jin Sahyuk was….</p>
<p>“Y… o… u….”</p>
<p>I punched Jin Sahyuk in the stomach. Her eyes widened. She coughed blood at the exact moment of the impact.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk slowly began to pull back, clutching her stomach. She was probably in the process of being flung backward.</p>
<p>“Ku… uek….”</p>
<p>I grabbed Jin Sahyuk by the shoulder and kicked her in the pit of her stomach this time. Tears flowed from Jin Sahyuk’s eyes but she countered with Reality Manipulation.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaak—</em></p>
<p>A sharp blade of magic power left a scar on my cheek.</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, wow.”</p>
<p>As expected of Jin Sahyuk, it seemed I couldn’t let my guard down even in my [Fate] state.</p>
<p>I acknowledged her strength and—</p>
<p>“Uk—! Uuek—! Kuek—!”</p>
<p>—proceeded to beat the crap out of Jin Sahyuk in all earnestness.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>It only took Tigris three minutes to completely annihilate his guards.</p>
<p>The guards in the front row were killed before they could do anything; others who understood the situation tried to fight back but failed.</p>
<p>Tigris had murdered all of his subordinates in just three minutes.</p>
<p>—…Get started, Suho. We’ll cover you.</p>
<p>“Roger.”</p>
<p>Tigris was finally alone and now was the best time to strike.</p>
<p>With Misteltein in his hand, Kim Suho dashed towards his target past the devastated field.</p>
<p><em>Pang—!</em></p>
<p>However, before Kim Suho could go anywhere near him, Tigris swung his fist. His punch flew towards Kim Suho who was still 500 meters away. This was the famous [Formless Tiger Punch], Tigris’s specialty.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>Kim Suho swung Misteltein and stopped the attack.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Only then did Tigris take interest in Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Staring straight at his enemy, Kim Suho whispered into his radio.</p>
<p>“…I’ll prepare myself for a long battle..”</p>
<p>—Yes, do that. It’s better that way. Since we’ve got the Chameleon Troupe with us, you won’t have to worry about reinforcements coming to help him.</p>
<p>[Formless Tiger Punch] was almost invincible. It was a punch that could travel afar, and along the way, it attacked everything in Tigris’s 320-degree field of view.</p>
<p>Still, [Formless Tiger Punch] was controlled by magic power. Tigris, as the descendant of the Himalayan Mountain Tyrant, naturally had a small capacity for magic power.</p>
<p>Therefore, a chance would eventually come so long as one could endure Formless Tiger Punch until Tigris’s magic power ran out.</p>
<p>That was exactly what Kim Suho was waiting for. He was fast enough to evade Tigris’s attacks and his Gift could sever Formless Tiger Punch.</p>
<p>“Tigris—!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shouted. Tigris got up slowly and glared at Kim Suho. The anger in his eyes seemed to have subsided.</p>
<p>To Tigris, Kim Suho shouted yet again—</p>
<p>“I killed Horseless—!”</p>
<p>He decided that the fastest way to deplete Tigris’s magic power was to drive him mad again.</p>
<p>“———!”</p>
<p>And his decision was wise.</p>
<p>Madness engulfed Tigris’s eyes once again. With an earth-crushing roar, countless [Formless Tiger Punch] rushed towards Kim Suho.</p>
<p><em>Pang—! Pang—!</em></p>
<p>The punches came from every direction. From the sky, from the ground, and from the air to the side. There wasn’t any distinguishable pattern in the attacks, and each punch was just as lethal as the others.</p>
<p>Despite this, Kim Suho managed to block them all. The sword of the Sword Saint was poised and efficient. The sword traveled diagonally and severed the punches that poured in from all directions.</p>
<p><em>B-B-B-Boom!</em></p>
<p>Amidst the endless succession of attacks, Kim Suho closed his eyes. His vision went dark but his other senses were heightened.</p>
<p>He now relied only on his senses and his intuition to deliver his attacks, reaching the epitome of perfect swordsmanship.</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>Tigris continued to swing his fists, using the ‘108-consecutive punches that he was so proud of. No one had survived this attack so far.</p>
<p>—<em>ssssk.</em></p>
<p>Kim Suho slid his sword back into its sheath, then drew his sword again and swung it forward.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—!</em></p>
<p>His sword draw technique spread out like a wave and thwarted Tigris’s 108-consecutive punches.</p>
<p>“…Is this all you’ve got?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s swordsmanship indeed suited his title, Sword Saint.</p>
<p>Kim Suho was now fully revealing his state of existence.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Africa, Undersea Cave]</p>
<p>Our first training, a mock grappling combat, ended in 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was now lying sick in bed, while I was sitting on the chair next to her and looking down at her. To be fair, I wasn’t in such a great condition either due to the side effects of [Fate].</p>
<p>“Anyways, until then, let’s just not talk about ‘king’ and ‘servant’ and all that. Cut off the root of the problem. We’ll only get headaches if we keep bringing it up.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glared at me in silence. The look in her eyes was quite threatening.</p>
<p>“Wipe that scowl off of your face.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sighed and turned over on her side.</p>
<p>She then muttered, “What are we doing for half a year?”</p>
<p>“First of all, dungeons.”</p>
<p>“…Dungeons?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk showed some interest.</p>
<p>“Yup. Africa is full of interesting dungeons. I heard there’s one called the ‘Quiz Dungeon’. Anyways, dungeons are dangerous, but they have amazing rewards.”</p>
<p>From now on, I needed to hunt for items. Clearing dungeons would not only help Jin Sahyuk grow but also allow me to secure the materials I would need in order to forge new pieces of equipment.</p>
<p>I planned to dismantle the existing artifacts with [Young Dwarf’s Dexterity] and recreate them as new artifacts of greater quality.</p>
<p>“…So, do you know where those dungeons are?” Jin Sahyuk asked flatly.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>I opened the Book of Truth and turned over the pages, trying to remember the locations of the dungeons. Suddenly, I remembered the name of the man that Bell had mentioned.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun, the former boss of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>“…What are you looking at? Show me.”</p>
<p>It seemed Jin Sahyuk was intrigued by my serious expression. But I closed the Book of Truth and returned it into Stigma. Then I looked at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“What? What is it this time?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk flinched, slightly intimidated by my gaze.</p>
<p>“….Hey. Do you know ‘Yi Yeonjun’?”</p>
<p>I thought Jin Sahyuk might know him.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“…I guess you wouldn’t remember other people’s names. You’re too busy being snotty.”</p>
<p>“There you go with your insults again, you bastard!”</p>
<p>“Stop calling me names.”</p>
<p>I put my hand over Jin Sahyuk’s head. Jin Sahyuk began to tremble in fear as a reaction to the earlier incident.</p>
<p>“For now, let’s just eat in peace.”</p>
<p>I went to the fridge in the corner of the cave and took out some ingredients. Beef, green onions, onions, garlic, chives, rice, cooking wine…. Then something crossed my mind and I turned my smartwatch on.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll ask Yoo Jinhyuk.”</p>
<p>He was still active, after all.</p>
<p>And while I was at it, I might as well send a text to Boss and let her know I was okay.</p>
<p>Bell told me that I would have no choice but to betray Boss, but my thoughts were different.</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>‘Yeah, let’s do that.’</p>
<p>First, I sent a text to Boss.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Having returned to his shelter, Bell let out a sigh.</p>
<p>He was shrouded in complete darkness without even a speck of light. Such living conditions were unsuitable for a human, but he had no choice but to comply as this place was a sanctuary located deep in the sea.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>‘So the Chameleon Troupe arrived at the underground village. Rumi probably escaped. Did Kim Hajin meet Jin Sahyuk as I planned?’</p>
<p>Many thoughts were tangled up inside his head.</p>
<p><em>Tssk—</em></p>
<p>Bell drew up the blinds and sat on a chair by a small table. The light of the deep sea came through the window. It was still very close to darkness, but Bell felt a little comfort from the dim light.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>A faint murmur.</p>
<p>Bell poured tea into the teacup as he turned his head towards the sound.</p>
<p>“Are you awake?”</p>
<p>There was no answer. But a disapproving sigh announced the existence of someone.</p>
<p>Bell smiled and took a sip of the tea.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you have some tea, too? I brought it from the Tower.”</p>
<p>Bell had spent an entire day talking to Kim Hajin, revealing his most secretive plans. But there was one thing he kept hidden.</p>
<p>That was the existence of a certain man.</p>
<p>“Haa.”</p>
<p>The sigh became louder.</p>
<p>And Bell called his name.</p>
<p>“Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>He was loved and treasured by some and loathed by many others.</p>
<p>He was known to have died a long time ago, but he resurrected after a long sleep.</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun answered reluctantly. He kept glancing at the window, visibly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Would you like some tea?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun’s eyebrows wriggled into a frown. His brown eyes became sharp, making his overall expression appear more firm.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Mm. How do you feel, then? It hasn’t been long since you woke up.”</p>
<p>“…Three months are long enough.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun got up from his bed.</p>
<p><em>Creek, creek.</em> He limped with one leg as he walked towards the chair facing Bell.</p>
<p>“Did you have some time to think about what I said?”</p>
<p>“Thinking is difficult now. I can’t keep my thoughts running for long.”</p>
<p>He sounded rigid and stern.</p>
<p>The way he spoke resembled Byul, as he was the originator of such tone.</p>
<p>“That’s why I said you shouldn’t stay in here for too long. 10 years was enough.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun woke up from his long sleep just three months ago. But the actual time he spent sleeping was dozens of times longer than 3 months.</p>
<p>“There was nothing else I could do. My entire body was ruined and I didn’t want to wake up in that state.”</p>
<p>“…Sure. More importantly, aren’t you going to meet Byul?”</p>
<p>Byul was very attached to Yi Yeonjin the last time Bell checked. However, a lot of time had passed since they last saw each other, and Bell wasn’t sure if Byul still felt the same way about his friend.</p>
<p>“Pft. Why would I meet Byul?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun gave a small smile and shook his head. Bell looked at his smile and the way his iconic dimples appeared in his cheeks.</p>
<p>Once, Bell had thought that Yi Yeonjun’s smile captured the purest form of evil, the same kind of mischievousness and innocence that belonged to a child.</p>
<p>“She’s doing fine without me.”</p>
<p>One could tell Yi Yeonjun was proud of Byul from the way he smiled.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t proud of her as a person; rather, his smile displayed the pride of a swordsman when he looked at his sword.</p>
<p>“So you’re not going to see her ever?”</p>
<p>“I’ll see her when the time is right. Don’t rush me.”</p>
<p>Byul still didn’t—and probably never will—know that the man who pushed her into the pit of despair was Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>‘…Byul, the salvation you received from Yeonjun was nothing but a deception.’</p>
<p>Bell sighed as he thought of her.</p>
<p>“So, what do you plan to do from now on, Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take some time to recover, then go after Chae Joochul.”</p>
<p>A long time ago, the man who destroyed Yi Yeonjun wasn’t Bell but Chae Joochul. It was just that the truth had been buried by Chae Joochul’s deceitful schemes.</p>
<p>“By the way, I’m surprised that Chae Jinyoon went amiss.”</p>
<p>And the man who planted the Devil’s Seed in Chae Jinyoon was Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>The man who incited the assassination of Chae Nayun’s mother was also probably Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“…Right.”</p>
<p>Bell knew that the man sitting in front of him was a ‘real monster’. But he had gotten too used to his friend to accept him for what he truly was. So, Bell smiled and put his hand on top of Yi Yeonjun’s head.</p>
<p>“First things first, you should really get your hair trimmed.”</p>
<p>“…Hair?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjin frowned.</p>
<p>“No need. I need to stay hidden for a while anyway and long hair will help with the disguise.”</p>
<p>“…Tsk. Then, I take that your next goal after killing Chae Joochul is still the same?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It became even clearer the longer I slept. It was as if someone was breathing the answer into my head.”</p>
<p>“…Really? That sounds interesting.”</p>
<p>Bell also knew that for Kim Hajin to reach his own end, he would need to kill this man.</p>
<p>‘When that time comes, I might feel a little sad,’ Bell thought.</p>
<p>For that reason, Byul would have to betray Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>She would never be able to forgive Kim Hajin for killing Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 294. Orden Annihilation Operation (1)</p>
<p>[Africa – Desolate Wilderness]</p>
<p>Northern winds blew across the cold wilderness, where a four-hour-long battle was now coming to an end.</p>
<p>The strength of the enraged Tigris’s [Formless Tiger Fist] subsided over time, but Kim Suho continued to maintain the initial prowess he displayed. The Sword Saint’s movements were clean, and his swordsmanship was splendid. There was nothing Tigris could do to get through Kim Suho’s offense and defense.</p>
<p>“Sword Saint… I’ll admit it’s a fitting title.” Cheok Jungyeong, who was observing their battle from afar, commented. Seeing Kim Suho’s impeccable swordsmanship, a strong urge to join their ‘artistic fight’ struck Cheok Jungyeong’s heart. But he knew the disgust of being interrupted in the middle of a good fight, so he held himself back.</p>
<p>“Huhu, how is it? He’s stronger than you, right?”</p>
<p>Aileen, who was standing by and watching the battle, commented with her arms crossed. Cheok Jungyeong glared at her strongly.</p>
<p>“It’s not a matter of strength but a matter of circumstance. If it were me, I wouldn’t have forced Tigris into such a cowardly situation.”</p>
<p>Tigris strength was also remarkable. But when Horseless died, he had revealed his full strength too easily, which he even used to exterminate his comrades. The battle was far from ‘fair’ to begin with.</p>
<p>“Cowardly? Oh please, think about what he did to the people he abducted. Plus, you shouldn’t be the one to talk about being cowardly. I saw what you guys did 20 years ago.”</p>
<p>“…We didn’t do that, dumbass.”</p>
<p>“Then who did it?”</p>
<p>“…The old us.”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding?” Aileen frowned at Cheok Jungyeong’s vague words.</p>
<p>“Kuhum.” Cheok Jungyeong let out a dry cough and dodged Aileen’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Tsk.” Aileen clicked her tongue and picked up her transceiver. “Jin Seyeon, Kim Suho, it’s time to end the tiger hunt. We can’t wait much longer.”</p>
<p>They could wait until Kim Suho cut down Tigris, but a long time had passed since the battle began. Although the Chameleon Troupe had taken over Lupiton and was preventing information from leaking out, there was a limit on how furtive one could be.</p>
<p>—Yes, understood.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon replied. Immediately afterward, Aileen formed a spear with her magic power. Jin Seyeon, who was about three kilometers away from Aileen, also nocked an arrow.</p>
<p>“This is a tiger-killing spear~”</p>
<p>Using Spirit Speech, Aileen infused a special attribute into the spear. She stroked the shaft of the magic spear and murmured like a mother caring for her child.</p>
<p>“It displays great power against the tiger-race. A single hit paralyzes the target, making it the most feared object of all tigers….”</p>
<p>Aileen carefully utilized Spirit Speech as Cheok Jungyeong stared at her in disgust of her tone.</p>
<p>“You—! Damn—! Human—!”</p>
<p>In the next moment, Tigris roared and shot towards Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“A mere human—!”</p>
<p>This was the moment Kim Suho was waiting for, when [Formless Tiger Punch] would weaken to the point that Tigris would have no choice but to close in on him.</p>
<p>Kim Suho remembered a certain piece of information Kim Hajin told him. Though it was a long time ago, Kim Hajin had clearly said that a Mountain Tyrant’s vital point was a blue mark on the heel of its hind leg.</p>
<p>So when Tigris charged towards him, Kim Suho made a small smile. Although Tigris had evolved into a humanoid monster, he had not overcome his weak point. In fact, it was unlikely that Mountain Tyrants knew their vital point was a mere mark on their heel.</p>
<p>“Huup—!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho thrust Misteltein forward. Tigris grabbed Misteltein without being suspicious, and that was when Kim Suho attacked Tigris’ heel with his sword’s scabbard.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Immediately, Tigris’s legs went numb. Aileen and Jin Seyeon made their move using this opening. Tigris had no way of dodging them.</p>
<p><em>Crack—!</em></p>
<p>A spear and an arrow pierced Tigris’s heart and stomach, dealing a clearly fatal injury. However, Tigris refused to let go of Misteltein.</p>
<p>“You… coward… my Horseless….”</p>
<p>Tigris glared at Kim Suho and expressed his fury. But Kim Suho wasn’t fazed in the slightest and faced Tigris with an even sturdier mind.</p>
<p>“…If that horse was that important to you, you should know. That the people you killed thoughtlessly were also important to others.”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth. A mere human dares to… kuhuk!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho infused magic power into Misteltein. A brilliant light rose up from the Sword Saint’s sword, and Tigris clenched his fists.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>Next, two roars clashed and resounded.</p>
<p>The Sword Saint’s sword and the Tyrant’s fist collided.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa…!</em></p>
<p>A burst of magic power dyed both heaven and earth. The clash of sword and fist shook the world, and the undulation of magic power spread out in all directions.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The battle thus came to an end.</p>
<p>Kim Suho let out a sigh and looked up at Tigris. He was no longer breathing, and Misteltein was piercing through his heart. However, Tigris’s eyes remained open. He was glaring at Kim Suho with eyes full of madness and barely squeezed out his last breaths.</p>
<p>“…Humans… I will curse you… even in death….”</p>
<p>At that moment, Misteltein activated its effect. By destroying Tigris’s heart, it absorbed a portion of the Gift Tigris possessed.</p>
<p>[Acquired Tigris’s Wish – Formless Tiger Punch]</p>
<p><em>Thud—</em></p>
<p>With that, Tigris’s heavy body fell to the ground.</p>
<p>[When you activate Misteltein’s Formless Tiger Punch, your close-range attacks will also cause long-ranged attacks.]</p>
<p>Kim Suho sheathed Misteltein. A light breeze blew his hair.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>The victory had a bitter aftertaste. Was it because it wasn’t a fair fight? But because the fight was a ‘subjugation’, not a ‘duel’, there was nothing he could have done about it.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kim Suho couldn’t help but wonder, did he really have the right to punish humanoid monsters?</p>
<p>It was strange. Until now, he had killed countless monsters without any sense of guilt, and the only difference between a monster and a humanoid monster was that the latter could think and talk like a human.</p>
<p>With complicated thoughts, Kim Suho gazed into Tigris’s eyes.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Africa, a nameless dungeon]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk and I arrived at a nameless dungeon. According to the Book of Truth, it was the [Basilisk Dungeon with Puzzles and Quizzes].</p>
<p>“…This is a dungeon?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked around with a scowl.</p>
<p>“…It is a bit odd.”</p>
<p>I probably had a similar face. Rather than a dungeon, this place was more like an arcade.</p>
<p>To describe it in greater detail, all sorts of games were being displayed on a black background.</p>
<p>“Looks like it was a stage-type dungeon. We probably have to clear each game.”</p>
<p>I stared at the different games inside the dungeon while activating [Observation and Reading].</p>
<p>[Quiz Game 1, 2, 3, 4 – Test your intelligence. The numbers represent the level of difficulty.]</p>
<p>[Puzzle Game 1, 2, 3, 4 – Test your creativity. The numbers represent the level of difficulty.]</p>
<p>[Clearing all games lets you enter the final stage – Basilisk and Fight.]</p>
<p>“…How are we supposed to do this?”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>I first started the quiz game.</p>
<p>—Ding, ding! The Quiz Game starts!”</p>
<p>“Ah, geez! That surprised me!”</p>
<p>A robotic voice rang out from the ceiling, and Jin Sahyuk jumped slightly.</p>
<p>“Say something before you do anything weird!”</p>
<p>“Shut up and follow me.”</p>
<p>“What’s happening?”</p>
<p>The quiz game started with a riddle.</p>
<p>What fire becomes when it dies, why the ice-cream died… most of them were laughably easy, but the catch was that the riddle was in ‘ancient runic language’.</p>
<p>Of course, I had no problem translating it.</p>
<p>“Sapphire, because it’s cold, scarecrow, almond.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows and stared at me.</p>
<p>I gave her a simple explanation.</p>
<p>“I’m smart.”</p>
<p>“What? That doesn’t make sense. Even in Akatrina, runic language is—”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stopped talking and glared at me with eyes full of suspicion.</p>
<p>It was about time she realized I wasn’t Kim Chundong.</p>
<p>In any case, I focused on solving the quizzes and puzzles, only taking 30 minutes to plow through all of them.</p>
<p>—You cleared all quizzes and puzzles! You will now be moved to the Basilisk Stage!</p>
<p><em>Dududu…</em></p>
<p>A secret passageway opened up along with a rumble. A purple world was spread out beyond the passageway.</p>
<p>The sky was purple, the land was crimson, and the Basilisk and its ‘spider underlings’ were black.</p>
<p>“You be the tank. I’ll support you from the back.”</p>
<p>“…What? Do you know what kind of monster a Basilisk is?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Basilisks were one of the monsters I created in my original setting.</p>
<p>A half-snake, half-dragon monster with sharp fangs, skin that was tougher than any qi reinforcement, and serpentine eyes that shot petrifying waves.</p>
<p>The Basilisk was a high-rank ~ pinnacle-rank monster and the ‘spider underlings’ around him were all high-intermediate-rank monsters, but I knew the Basilisk’s fatal weak point.</p>
<p>“Trust me and protect me. That’s all you have to do.”</p>
<p>“Listen to me, you bastard, Basilisks were calamity-level monsters even in Akatrina. A single one of them needed hundreds of knights to take down.”</p>
<p>“I’ll do more than what hundreds of knights can do anyways, so just do as I say.”</p>
<p>I first transformed the Desert Eagle into a machine gun. I had thousands of bullets on me, and the gun fired at 2000 RPM.</p>
<p>The Basilisk’s flaw was its defense. In truth, it was more of a flaw in the setting.</p>
<p>[Basilisk’s Skin – reduces 90% of physical damage received and 99% of magical damage received.]</p>
<p>Reducing damage by 90% meant 10% of the damage couldn’t be dodged. As it didn’t reduce a flat value like the defense of other monsters, he was the perfect target for my machine gun. As long as I keep attacking it, it should die eventually.</p>
<p>Of course, just in case that wasn’t enough, I knew about its vital point under its jaw.</p>
<p>“No, if you’re going to do this, do it by yourself.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re coming with me.”</p>
<p>For the record, Jin Sahyuk’s attacks were all magical damage, so she was extremely incompatible against the Basilisk. There was a reason she was reluctant to fight.</p>
<p>“You….”</p>
<p><em>Tudududu—!</em></p>
<p>I started firing. The Basilisk, who had not yet recognized us, quickly began to charge over. Jin Sahyuk cursed.</p>
<p>“You son of a bitch!”</p>
<p>—Kiaaak!</p>
<p>“Dammit!”</p>
<p>The secret passageway closed, leaving us trapped inside. Jin Sahyuk now had no choice but to fight.</p>
<p>“Move fast. Think about all the good equipment we can make from that guy’s corpse.”</p>
<p>A Basilisk’s skin and fangs were excellent for making equipment, and its flesh, eyes, and heart could be used to make medicine. This dungeon should also give us a good reward for clearing it.</p>
<p>There was a reason I was excited about clearing this dungeon.</p>
<p>“You bastard.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk released her magic power with Reality Manipulation, and I continued to fire a barrage of bullets.</p>
<p><em>Tudududududu-!</em></p>
<p>Hundreds of bullets first eliminated the spider underlings before slowly making their way towards the Basilisk’s body.</p>
<p>—Kiaaak!</p>
<p>The enraged Basilisk breathed out green, venomous flames. Thankfully, Jin Sahyuk was the one in charge of the defense.</p>
<p>“Huup!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk extinguished the breath by isolating the path of the breath from reality.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re up to but finish it quickly!” Jin Sahyuk shouted.</p>
<p>I didn’t reply and continued to fire.</p>
<p><em>Tududududu….</em></p>
<p>I could feel myself being destressed like I was in a real arcade game.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea, North Pyeongan Province – Silver Essential Hospital]</p>
<p>3 p.m., Korea.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha rushed over to Silver Essential Hospital after receiving an emergency call.</p>
<p>“Um, Chairman Yoo, about this….”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>As soon as Yoo Yeonha got off the Dwarven Supercar she arrived in, employees of the hospital flocked to her with worried faces.</p>
<p>“I’ll see what happened with my own eyes.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha entered the hospital. Soon, she arrived at the highest floor, where Oh Jaejin was staying in.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>For Oh Jaejin and his wife, Essence of the Strait had turned the penthouse into a village from the 1970s. However, the penthouse was now empty. No signs of life remained, and without anyone to turn the floor heating on, the wooden floor was freezing cold.</p>
<p>“How long has it been like this?”</p>
<p>“He was here when we checked last night…”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha closed her eyes for a moment and sighed. Something hot began to boil inside her.</p>
<p>“He ran away, without a doubt.”</p>
<p>The Oh Jaejin couple had run away. They must have wanted to live the rest of their life in peace now that Oh Jaejin’s dementia was cured.</p>
<p>“…W-We’re deeply sorry!”</p>
<p>The hospital employees bowed down to their waists.</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha didn’t say anything. She was angry at the couple’s betrayal, but she couldn’t bring herself to curse out loud.</p>
<p>In the first place, Oh Jaejin was given the honored title of the ‘Nine Stars’ because he sacrificed himself to save the world. But there was no meaning to saving the world if one wasn’t a part of it. Asking him to sacrifice himself twice was unreasonable as well.</p>
<p>“…It’s fine. If he wanted to run away, there’s nothing any of us could have done.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha turned around with bitterness. It was then that a new alarm popped up on her smartwatch.</p>
<p>[You gained DP! You obtained 12,328 DP!]</p>
<p>The character she was sponsoring, Lailos, had helped her gain more DP. The news livened up Yoo Yeonha, but she maintained a stiff expression and ordered the employees present.</p>
<p>“First, change the floor back to have VIP-rooms. Don’t try to find Oh Jaejin-nim… hm?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the smell of kimchi jjigae flowed into Yoo Yeonha’s nostrils.</p>
<p>“What’s this smell?”</p>
<p>“Ah… the esteemed Oh Jaejin and his wife made kimchi jjigae before they left….”</p>
<p>“…Ha, how kind of them.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha laughed and walked into the elevator.</p>
<p>‘It does smell great. I guess I’ll have kimchi jjigae for dinner.’ Yoo Yeonha thought. ‘…The kimchi jjigae Kim Hajin made me was amazing. I wonder if he’ll cook for me again…’</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha closed the elevator door as she swallowed the saliva collecting in her mouth.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Four days passed since the assassination of Tigris.</p>
<p>A bloody wind blew inside Lupiton.</p>
<p>The village lord, Pleron, escaped in fear of being punished, and Lupiton’s residents had their curfews hastened to 9 p.m.</p>
<p>More importantly, the enraged Orden made a formal declaration to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>“Hmmmm….”</p>
<p>With a storm of war brewing, the underground fortress was undergoing heavy construction to build a tunnel leading to Orden’s palace.</p>
<p>“Orden’s palace is right above this place?”</p>
<p>The Special Task Force paid DP to the demon merchant to arrive at the foot of the palace.</p>
<p>“Yes, we did it carefully. Not even Orden should have detected anything.”</p>
<p>The demon merchant replied to Aileen’s question.</p>
<p>“Great, then what about what we asked for?”</p>
<p>“It’s the same.”</p>
<p>Commander Yi Gongmyung had asked the demon merchant to create 18 different entryways.</p>
<p>The Special Task Force’s 177 members were to split into teams of 10 members and infiltrate the palace to draw attention, while Hyenckes and Chae Joochul would deal with Orden.</p>
<p>“…Aileen-ssi.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s up?”</p>
<p>Yi Yongha, who followed Aileen, muttered as he trembled</p>
<p>“The Immortal and the Lord of Steel are working together in this operation. Isn’t that amazing? I’m already getting goosebumps.”</p>
<p>“…Shut it, fool. There are only four days left until the D-Day. Ready yourself.”</p>
<p>The dual-pronged operation was planned to begin in four days. Hundreds of thousands of human soldiers would gather in Africa. Orden would naturally focus most of his forces on the large army, so the Special Task Force would use this opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>“You’re right, we only have four days left.”</p>
<p>“…Are you nervous?”</p>
<p>Aileen turned around. Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, and Yun Seung-Ah were also standing there.</p>
<p>“No, I’m okay.”</p>
<p>“…I’m fine too.”</p>
<p>“I’m a bit angry.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, and Yun Seung-Ah responded respectively. Yun Seung-Ah was the only one who was sulking.</p>
<p>Aileen sighed and stared at Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>“Why do you have that I-stepped-on-poop face? Are you a kid?”</p>
<p>“Me? You’re the one who didn’t tell me Jain came here.”</p>
<p>Jain had told Aileen that she disguised herself as Pleron. This was the first time Aileen found out Jain was a part of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>“…It’s politics.”</p>
<p>“U-Unni! You know what she did to me in the past—”</p>
<p>“Think of the bigger picture. If you can’t cooperate, leave the team.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah bit her lips and glared at Aileen before turning around.</p>
<p><em>Koong, koong—!</em></p>
<p>She expressed her anger openly as she stomped away, and Aileen only shook her head.</p>
<p>“She’s sulking. Kim Suho, you deal with it.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled wryly at Aileen’s order.</p>
<p>“…Oh right!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Chae Nayun’s eyes shot open.</p>
<p>When Aileen and Kim Suho tilted their heads, Chae Nayun took out the [Invitation Letter to the Love Room] from her pocket.</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s that~?”</p>
<p>Aileen gave her a curious look.</p>
<p>“This? You see…”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun wanted to use it before the mission. Since she was at the risk of death, she didn’t want to die without finding out who Extra 7 was.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>But Chae Nayun knew she was on a top-secret mission. She wasn’t so stupid as to bring an outsider into it.</p>
<p>Plus, since Extra 7 told her to call him when she was in critical danger, she decided to use when that time came, rather than to just say hi.</p>
<p>“What, so boring.” Aileen frowned.</p>
<p>Kim Suho, who knew about the item’s effect, placed his hand on Chae Nayun’s head.</p>
<p>“Ah, what are you doing? Don’t get over yourself.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun struggled to push Kim Suho’s hand off.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Do that to Seung-Ah Unni, not me.”</p>
<p>“…Kuhum, why do you guys keep mentioning Guild Leader Yun Seung-Ah.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho let out a dry cough with a flushed face.</p>
<p>“Anyways, you guys should leave too. Same for you, Yi Yongha. I have something to do.”</p>
<p>Aileen shooed the others away. Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, and Yi Yongha were all chased out, and the tunnel turned silent.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>Only four days remained until the humanoid monster annihilation mission.</p>
<p>“This tunnel will be concealed perfectly so that no one can discover it….”</p>
<p>Aileen added Spirit Speech to the tunnel.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 295. Orden Annihilation Operation (2)</p>
<p>‘Magic bullet’ was a bullet made up of tempered steel and condensed magic power. The destructive force of a single magic bullet—sold by Essential Armory for 100 million won—was equivalent to that of a steel sword wielded by a low-intermediate-rank Hero.</p>
<p>I could further strengthen it to the level of high-intermediate-rank grade-1 ~ a low-high-rank by enhancing the bullet with Random Consolidation System and combining it with the Desert Eagle and Aether.</p>
<p>But not Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Because Jin Sahyuk’s attacks relied on ‘magic power’, she couldn’t inflict any ‘physical damage’ on her opponents. Though, she could always alter the physical laws, for example by overturning the ground with her magic power.</p>
<p>[Basilisk’s Skin — Reduce physical damage by 90% and magic damage by 99%.]</p>
<p>[Basilisk’s Fang — Shatter magic by directly ‘biting’ it]</p>
<p>[Basilisk’s Mystic Eyes — Gaze of Deceleration. Slows down the speed of magic power circulating in the target's blood.]</p>
<p>Now, take a look at these magnificent effects that completely nullify magic and magic power.</p>
<p>Another name for the Basilisk was the ‘Scourge of Magicians’.</p>
<p>This mystical beast was created specifically to counter people like Jin Sahyuk. She could never win against a Basilisk alone.</p>
<p>But I thought <em>I</em> could win easily.</p>
<p>As I said before, as long as I continued to hit him on his vital point, I believed he would eventually collapse.</p>
<p>“Ah, fuck!”</p>
<p>…Of course, it turned out to be harder than I thought.</p>
<p>Again, this was all because of the co-author.</p>
<p>“Can’t believe I wasted 3 whole days in this shithole!”</p>
<p>Currently, we were hiding in a cave to escape the Basilisk.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s cry struck my ear.</p>
<p>“…”.</p>
<p>Without a word, I leaned against the cave wall and turned my gaze to her. Jin Sahyuk continued to yell but occasionally shuddered in fear that the Basilisk might have heard her.</p>
<p>“Kuhum….”</p>
<p>As evidenced by our current situation, the Basilisk wasn’t as easy of a target as I thought.</p>
<p>In fact, he was off the charts on the difficulty scale.</p>
<p>His ‘recovery’ ability was much more overwhelming than in my original setting.</p>
<p>[Stage Effect — the Basilisk has been blessed with Stage Effect. His recovery rate is increased by 300%.]</p>
<p>The Basilisk itself hadn’t changed. The problem was this strange setting called ‘Stage Effect’. No matter how many times I shot him with Magic Bullets, Basilisk instantly recovered from his wounds.</p>
<p>What was even worse was that the only way to clear this dungeon was to defeat the Basilisk. In other words, we were stuck here until we killed it, and running away wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you say something?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk hissed.</p>
<p>I spoke.</p>
<p>“This is actually good.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>My voice sounded surprisingly calm.</p>
<p>Speechless, Jin Sahyuk looked at me in a daze.</p>
<p>“What the hell do you mean by… no, wait, why do you only use that weapon? Go and beat that snake up like you did with me!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk demanded.</p>
<p>…She was overestimating my physical strength because of Fate. Contrary to her belief, I couldn’t just go around beating everyone up at my will.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Why not?!”</p>
<p>Certain conditions had to be met before I could register a new target for [Fate]. With Jin Sahyuk, the condition was ‘exchanging dialogues at least 30 times’. But as expected of such a powerful Unique Skill, the condition became harder to meet the more it was used. The condition for registering a second target was ‘exchange dialogues at least 50 times, including self introductions’.</p>
<p>Obviously there was no way for me to achieve that.</p>
<p>“…I’m your ‘trainer’, not someone who clears dungeons for you.”</p>
<p>So I just offered her an excuse.</p>
<p>“What the fuck….”</p>
<p>A look of despair crossed Jin Sahyuk’s face.</p>
<p>With a sigh, she dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Time continued to pass.</p>
<p>There was nothing much to do in the dark, silent cave.</p>
<p>I began searching for ways to clear this stage with [Observation and Reading].</p>
<p><em>Growl—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard the rumbling of an empty stomach. I raised my head and looked at Jin Sahyuk. She had her eyes closed, deep in thought.</p>
<p>“…Hey. Are you hungry?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk opened her eyes slowly.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Oh, but I think you are.”</p>
<p>Having sensed the faint sarcasm in my voice, Jin Sahyuk frowned discontentedly.</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate me. Hunger used to be my best friend. Have <em>you</em> ever survived only by eating grass roots?”</p>
<p>She was righteously enraged.</p>
<p>Slightly embarrassed, I nodded and turned my gaze to the outside.</p>
<p><em>Hisss—!</em></p>
<p>There, the Basilisk was giving orders to a couple of spiders. He was probably saying something like, ‘Find those two imbeciles and bring them to me! Hissss—!’.</p>
<p>I watched the Basilisk for a while. Then I suddenly remembered the ‘mini-game’ and pulled it up.</p>
<p>「…‘Extra’s Knight’ Litrain became the youngest high-intermediate-rank knight in history.</p>
<p>But things haven’t been going well for her recently. She borrowed money to build a temple for ‘Extra-nim’ that failed to capture people’s attention. She also ran out of DP. But what is currently troubling her the most is the feeling that her growth stopped.</p>
<p>She wants to become a high-rank knight as quickly as possible, so she can repay ‘Extra’ for his kindness…. Ever since she stopped receiving donations, other knights insisted that her sponsor abandoned her. But Litrain still believes that if she tries hard enough, ‘Extra’ would reach out to her one day and tell her ‘you did well’, ‘keep it up’.</p>
<p>She feels like she could do anything to hear those words….」</p>
<p>“What the. Why is she so nice?”</p>
<p>I had been so busy that I left her alone for almost two months, which equaled two years in her world. Yet she built a temple in my name.</p>
<p>I checked the amount of DP Litrain made me so far.</p>
<p>It was 53,271 DP in total.</p>
<p>I added 46,729 DP to it and donated a grand total of 100,000 DP to her.</p>
<p>[You donated 100,000 DP!]</p>
<p>[You left a message — ‘You did well. Keep it up.’]</p>
<p>[Litrain is surprised. Hard times are past her and she’s moved to tears….]</p>
<p>“Hey, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Jin Sahyuk leaned towards me.</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh. I’m thinking of ways to kill the Basilisk.”</p>
<p>I did have a 9-star card in my card pocket.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Story of a Legend on the Mural] [Individual] [9-star] ＊Effective Good＊</p>
<p>●Part of a legend manifests to assist you.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I could easily defeat the Basilisk with this card. But it would be a huge waste to use this right now. I’d been saving it for the very last fight: the battle against Baal.</p>
<p>“And how are you going to do that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m thinking I could play around with attributes.”</p>
<p>The Basilisk’s attribute was poison. To counter poison, I needed an even stronger poison. So I would have to apply poison-attribute to my bullets, then….</p>
<p>“…Wait a minute.”</p>
<p>Suddenly a brilliant idea crossed my mind.</p>
<p>‘What if I could extract the Basilisk’s poison and ‘crystalize’ it?’</p>
<p>Of course, the Basilisk’s poison was too strong even for Aether to handle. If it got anywhere near me, there was a good enough chance that it would not only melt Aether but also my entire body.</p>
<p>But right now, I had Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>If Jin Sahyuk could use Reality Manipulation and allow only a small part of the Basilisk’s poisonous breath to pass through, then I could crystalize the breath with [Extraction and Permanent Materialization].</p>
<p>“…Hey. Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>The Basilisk could become our gateway to the mass production of poisonous bullets.</p>
<p>“Just do as I say.”</p>
<p>And the bullet made from the Basilisk’s poison would surely be lethal to all monsters, humanoid monsters, and Djinns.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Gwanghwamun, Korea — Tower of Hero, Upper Floor]</p>
<p>“The current situation in Lupiton is complicated.”</p>
<p>On the highest floor of the Tower of Hero, where the most important meetings were held, Yi Gongmyung was giving a briefing of the mission to three important people.</p>
<p>“After the death of General Tigris, Orden’s rage spread to Lupiton. He’s making life difficult for not only humans but also humanoid monsters. The harsh living conditions have freed some of the humans from Orden’s brainwashing. It seems that some of the monsters are also turning against Orden. The Resistance is rescuing the de-brainwashed residents from Lupiton and helping them escape Africa.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul, Heynckes, and Yoo Yeonha listened attentively to Yi Gongmyung.</p>
<p>“We have decided to take advantage of the confusion and rage to prepare a second attack. Over 100,000 of our soldiers are currently out in the fields of Africa. Surely, Orden’s elite soldiers would gather there to confront us.”</p>
<p>Orden's Palace would be empty, and Chae Joochul and Heynckes would proceed to assassinate Orden.</p>
<p>It was a simple yet systematic plan.</p>
<p>“…I see. That sounds fun.”</p>
<p>Heynckes nodded with a smile but Chae Joochul remained expressionless.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung handed the two men velvet pouches.</p>
<p>“Inside are pinnacle-grade medicine and magic scrolls. I wanted to prepare some cards for you, but only Players can use them.”</p>
<p>When Kim Suho cleared the Tower of Wish, the conditions for card use were adjusted. Originally, only Players who reached the 21st floor of the Tower of Wish could use the cards. But now, any Player could use them.</p>
<p>“Anyways, O Queen of Seoul.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a smirk, Heynckes looked back at Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“…Please stop the joke.”</p>
<p>“Haha, but it’s no joke. That’s what the media calls you: The Queen of Seoul…. Anyways, I heard Oh Jaejin ran away?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded with a long face.</p>
<p>“Yes, I delivered him the medical pill for curing his side effect. And afterwards…”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>However, Heynckes did not think lowly of Oh Jaejin.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing scarier than losing yourself.”</p>
<p>‘Death’ would’ve been a better side effect.</p>
<p>To lose oneself and to forget all the values and beliefs that one has kept for an entire lifetime—</p>
<p>What could be more tragic than such an end?</p>
<p>“Well then, Joochul.”</p>
<p>Heynckes called Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>Despite Heynckes’s friendly demeanor, Chae Joochul remained nonchalant.</p>
<p>“Let us get ready.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The folding fan was all Chae Joochul needed.</p>
<p>But Heynckes was different.</p>
<p>Heynckes took out his armor for the first time in forever.</p>
<p>“Come.”</p>
<p>With a single word from Heynckes, his armor <em>came</em> to him.</p>
<p><em>Clunk— Clunk—</em></p>
<p>The breastplate stretched across his chest and the gaiters encompassed his legs. The chain mail, the gauntlets, and other parts of the armor surrounded his body, and lastly, the helmet concealed Heynckes’s face.</p>
<p>Just like that, each part of the armor was precisely put together.</p>
<p>It was not the old fashioned, heavy and crude kind of armor.</p>
<p>You could only see armor like this in games. The harmonious combination of silver armor and red cape was very classy.</p>
<p>[Steel Spirit Resistance — Increase resistance to all attributes by 80%]</p>
<p>[Steel Spirit Rigidity — Reduce damage by 80%]</p>
<p>[Steel Spirit Regeneration — Constant recovery rivaling time-reversal]</p>
<p>[Steel Spirit Sword — Sword sturdier than any metal]</p>
<p>[Steel Spirit Intuition — The collective intelligence of 23 invincible ‘Steel Spirits’.]</p>
<p>[Steel Will — No ‘metal’ in the world can defy Heynckes.]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha stared at Heynckes in a daze.</p>
<p>“I see your armor is still needlessly garish.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul remarked flatly.</p>
<p>“Really? Now, let’s turn that frown upside down, Joochul. You’re on your way to see your granddaughter, after all.”</p>
<p>“Why do you care about my granddaughter?”</p>
<p>“She’s a memorable one, that granddaughter of yours.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Let’s play another game of chess later. Unlike you, your granddaughter is terrible at chess.”</p>
<p>Heynckes continued to talk, and over time, Chae Joochul’s expressionless face turned into a small frown.</p>
<p>Heynckes liked the change in his friend’s expression.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Underground Fortress in Africa]</p>
<p>Amidst a tense atmosphere, all 177 members of the Special Task Force gathered in the plaza of the fortress.</p>
<p>“…Everyone, the entire coalition's forces have gathered here in Africa.”</p>
<p>The final operation they had been waiting for was about to commence.</p>
<p>“I believe we’re ready.”</p>
<p>Aileen stood on the podium and began her short speech.</p>
<p>“The mission starts tomorrow morning, before sunrise. But don’t be too nervous.”</p>
<p>The anxiety, the agitation and the fear that they all felt began to fade slowly before Aileen’s Spirit Speech.</p>
<p>“…Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak approached Kim Suho in the middle of the speech. He was carrying [Xiang Yu’s Conqueror Spear] that he purchased for 200 billion won.</p>
<p>It was a legendary artifact, second only to [Longinus] among spears.</p>
<p>“Wow, that spear, it’s….”</p>
<p>“Haha. That’s right. This is the spear wielded by the strongest warrior of ancient times. It even has two use effects, ‘World-Covering Qi’ and ‘Conqueror’s Farewell’, named after his famous anecdotes. Lü Bu is nothing compared to him. Hahaha. Hahahahaha. Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak burst into laughter. It was unclear whether he wanted to relieve his own nervousness or simply show off his new weapon.</p>
<p>“This spear is beautiful inside and out. It captures the supremacy of a king.”</p>
<p>It was worth all the boasting in the world, indeed.</p>
<p>The artifact originally belonged to none other than Xiang Yu, one of the most prominent warlords of the ancient times. In fact, all the nearby Heroes, including Chae Nayun and Yun Seung-Ah, threw awestruck glances at the Conqueror Spear.</p>
<p>“Congratulations. I’m jealous.”</p>
<p>“…Enough with the formalities. Do you wanna make a bet?”</p>
<p>“A bet?”</p>
<p>With a chuckle, Shin Jonghak tightened his grip around the spear.</p>
<p>“On who’ll be the one to kill Orden.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho stared at Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak was beaming with confidence, and the magic power surrounding his Conqueror Spear was equally as confident and courageous as its owner.</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“Let’s make a bet.”</p>
<p>The negative feelings that they once harbored for each other had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak was no longer the cowardly and narrow-minded teenager he once was, and Kim Suho no longer considered him an ‘arrogant noble’.</p>
<p>This was the butterfly effect caused by a man who wasn’t here.</p>
<p>“Everyone—!”</p>
<p>Aileen suddenly raised her hand and shouted.</p>
<p>“Don’t die! We’ll fight and win!”</p>
<p>Her words were imbued with powerful Spirit Speech.</p>
<p>They turned into snow that piled up in the hearts of the Heroes in the form of determination.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Basilisk Dungeon]</p>
<p>I continued the extraction process with Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>In 12 hours we created 55,000 [Basilisk’s Poison Crystal].</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha could make tens of thousands of bullets out of this.</p>
<p>Or I could just shoot the raw crystals. Though, in order to do that, I would first have to add an ‘anti-poison’ attribute to the Desert Eagle.</p>
<p>“…When does this end?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked with a sigh. She was clearly worn out from the overuse of Reality Manipulation.</p>
<p>“This is enough for now. The Orden Annihilation Operation will begin soon.”</p>
<p>I put all the crystals in my spatial pouch and got up. <em>Woong—</em> My spatial pouch began to suck the crystals up like a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>“…Can we leave now?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>A little while ago I realized how to defeat the Basilisk.</p>
<p>The Basilisk’s resiliency, which we found to be troublesome, was due to the [Stage Effect] attached to his skin that faintly glimmered in green.</p>
<p>But this effect could easily be nullified with the [Mystic Key].</p>
<p>“All I need is this.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>I took out the [Mystic Key].</p>
<p>The only problem was getting near the Basilisk, but this could be solved with Jin Sahyuk’s help.</p>
<p>After I get rid of the Stage Effect with this key, I could simply blast the monster with my bullets. Or I could synthesize and condense some Basilisk’s poison, enhance it with [Random Consolidation System], and shoot it at him.</p>
<p>Poison could be countered with even stronger poison, after all.</p>
<p>“Hey, Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>“…What.”</p>
<p>However, in order to do that….</p>
<p>“You go distract him.”</p>
<p>First, I had to get rid of the [Stage Effect] attached to the Basilisk’s skin.</p>
<p>“…Haa. Fine….”</p>
<p>To my surprise, Jin Sahyuk stepped forward without putting up a fight.</p>
<p>…Three hours later.</p>
<p>Along with the body of a Basilisk, we obtained two amazing artifacts.</p>
<p>Even Jin Sahyuk exclaimed in surprise at the sight of them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 296. Orden Annihilation Operation (3)</p>
<p>“…How should we split it?” Jin Sahyuk asked while I was handling the Basilisk’s corpse. Glancing back, I saw her eagerly staring at the dungeon’s rewards.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Killing the Basilisk rewarded us with two items.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Pinnacle-grade Dungeon Box]</p>
<p>—What item could be inside?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Alexander III’s Cape] [Pinnacle-grade] [Ancient Legendary Artifact]</p>
<p>—The cape worn by Macedon’s conqueror. Its wearer will exude formless charisma.</p>
<p>「2 Point Invariable Stat Increase – Charm (9 points max)」</p>
<p>「Ignore 50% of Physical Damage」</p>
<p>「Conqueror’s Boon – increases the growth rate of ‘magic power’ and ‘Gifts’.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One was a random box that had yet to be opened, and the other was the item Jin Sahyuk was staring at in awe. In this world, ‘equipment of a well-known ancient general’ was much more noble and powerful than a ‘divine weapon of an unknown god’. This was also the reason Xiang Yu’s Conqueror Spear and Lü Bu’s Square Sky Halberd were considered two of the strongest weapons.</p>
<p>In this regard, the cape of the Conqueror Alexander the Great was an incredible artifact. Although Eastern influence was strong in this world because of Korea, the ancient Macedonian conqueror wasn’t so easily forgotten.</p>
<p>“Then… this cape can be mine….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk carefully picked up Alexander’s cape. I stared at her fixedly.</p>
<p>“…W-Why? It’s okay, right?”</p>
<p>She flinched with a guilty conscience.</p>
<p>“Do you even know who Alexander III is?”</p>
<p>“What? Don’t underestimate me. Of course, I do. Alexander the Great is one of the few people of this world that I look up to.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk surprisingly praised Alexander. Well, he was a king of great charisma, ambition, and character. Jin Sahyuk likely saw him as a senior who walked the path she wanted to take.</p>
<p>“Mm, I see, to think my king has respect for another king. As your servant, I am touched.”</p>
<p>I spoke sarcastically like a servant. Jin Sahyuk’s reaction was funny. She stared at me with her eyes wide like a rabbit before taking a few steps back and murmuring, “…Don’t do that. It confuses me.”</p>
<p>I shrugged and went back to finishing butchering the Basilisk’s corpse. I put the body in my spatial pouch, and put its skin over my Black Lotus Suit with [Synthesis].</p>
<p>[‘Basilisk’s Epidermis’ has been synthesized with ‘Black Lotus Suit’.]</p>
<p>[‘Black Lotus Suit’ gained the following effect – 30% Physical Damage Reduction, 40% Magic Damage Reduction]</p>
<p>“What are we doing next?”</p>
<p>Hearing Jin Sahyuk’s question, I looked back at her.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? There’s Orden to worry abo…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was already wearing Alexander’s cape. The way she touched it with sparkling eyes made her look like a kid who received her Christmas present.</p>
<p>…It irked me for some reason.</p>
<p>“I’m letting you borrow it. It’s not yours.”</p>
<p>“What? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk protested immediately. She clenched the cape and glared at me strongly.</p>
<p>“Why would it be yours? I did at least 80% of the work in clearing this dungeon.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit. If I wasn’t here with you, you wouldn’t have been able to clear it.”</p>
<p>“Oh…? ‘With me’, you say~? I didn’t expect my king to say something like that… Anyways, the System thinks otherwise.”</p>
<p>I grinned. Jin Sahyuk should be able to see the [Dungeon Clear Breakdown] as well. According to the system, I made 83% of the contribution while Jin Sahyuk only made 17%. The dungeon rewards were decided based on a dice-roll that was proportional to one’s contribution.</p>
<p>“But I did what you said without complaining, so you should give this to me….”</p>
<p>“Dice please.”</p>
<p>I called for the System’s dice-roll without listening to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Two six-sided dice immediately appeared. If the sum of the two dice was between 4 and 12, the rewards would be mine. If it were two or three, they would be Jin Sahyuk’s. The dice would be rolled for each of the items.</p>
<p><em>Drrrr—</em></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the two rolls came out to 11 and 12.</p>
<p>The [Pinnacle-grade Dungeon Box] and [Alexander III’s Cape] fell into my hands.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>A gloomy look surfaced on Jin Sahyuk’s face. It looked like a mix of feeling cheated, annoyed, and sad.</p>
<p>“Here, you can keep wearing it for now. I’m letting you borrow it temporarily, but I’ll lengthen it if you listen to me well.”</p>
<p>I consoled her and then took out the ‘Basilisk’s Fang’ to grind to dust. I planned to use this dust for Medea’s ceremonial robe. Since it was close to completion, Medea would be able to descend soon.</p>
<p>“…Don’t forget what you just said.” Jin Sahyuk muttered reluctantly.</p>
<p>“I won’t.”</p>
<p>With that, we left the dungeon. Our next destination was Orden’s palace, where we expected a heated battle to be taking place.</p>
<p>It was time for me to go end the third main phase.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Central Africa, Orden’s Territory]</p>
<p>The moment Yi Gongmyung sent the signal, the Special Task Force entered the 18 passageways in their respective teams. The garden, research center, housing facility, etc. The Heroes raided all important parts of the palace except Orden’s royal court.</p>
<p>Chief Officer of Essence of the Strait’s Tower of Wish Team, Kim Youngjin.</p>
<p>Guild Leader of Creator’s Sacred Grace, Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>Swordsman of Wish, Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Vice-Leader of Desolate Moon, Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Essence of the Strait’s elite member, Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Divine Archer, Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>Spirit Speech Master, Aileen.</p>
<p>Hellfire Yi Yongha.</p>
<p>The Special Task Force infiltrated the palace quickly.</p>
<p>“…Is it there?”</p>
<p>Here on the outskirts of Africa, there were non-Heroes who were asked to help by various governments or the Association.</p>
<p>“Hm, looks like it’ll be fun.”</p>
<p>The Hero who was recently promoted to rank 10 among Master-rank Heroes, the Wolf of Valhalla, Yoo Sihyuk.</p>
<p>Though he spent most of his time focusing on raising the future generation in his martial arts camp in Baekdu Mountain, he had returned for this special mission. With his incredible skills, he crossed Africa lightly and arrived at Orden’s palace while defeating monsters and humanoid monsters.</p>
<p>—Krrr.</p>
<p>—Grrr.</p>
<p>Next to him were eight white wolves. They were ‘Sword Beasts’, spirit beasts that gave him the title, ‘Wolf of Valhalla’.</p>
<p>These wolves were a part of Yoo Sihyuk’s Gift, manifested by his swordsmanship. A single Sword Beast was equivalent to a high-rank grade-1 Hero in strength.</p>
<p>“Mm, humanoid monsters are coming here. Can you feel them?”</p>
<p>“…I can.”</p>
<p>Another man responded to Yoo Sihyuk’s question. Black hair and well-defined facial features. It was the Master-rank Hero, Yoo Jinwoong, who was called the Abdicated King of Seoul because of his daughter’s success.</p>
<p>Of the 70 Master-rank Heroes, only 30 were participating in today’s mission. The remaining 40 either died while trying to assassinate Orden, betrayed humanity like the Temple of Justice’s Park Hanho, or were officially ‘missing’ for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>“Judging by their killing intent and unique aura, it seems there are at least three of them.”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong slowly released his magic power. <em>Pzzt—! Pzzt—!</em> Electric currents made with red magic power crackled violently.</p>
<p>“Agreed. They’ll be here soon.”</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk rubbed his chin and looked forward in anticipation. He could feel more than one source of powerful demonic energy approaching him.</p>
<p>…Three seconds later.</p>
<p><em>Whooosh—!</em></p>
<p>Three humanoid monsters appeared with a fierce gust of wind.</p>
<p>“Kurahaha! Kurahahaha! You two must have big hearts—!”</p>
<p>“…Quiet, Croxus. They’re strong… don’t underestimate them.”</p>
<p>“Humans are humans no matter how strong they are. They can’t be our match.”</p>
<p>All three humanoid monsters closely resembled humans. One was a male with the outer shell of a rhinoceros beetle on his back, one was clearly modeled after the nine-tailed fox, and the last one was a giant who looked like a mix of an ogre and a troll.</p>
<p>“Let’s see….”</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk remembered the information he was given from Yi Gongmyung. The Hero Association’s spy had worked hard to obtain this information.</p>
<p>[Croxus]</p>
<p>—Legend Beetle humanoid monster.</p>
<p>—Threat level: [Master-rank]</p>
<p>—The toughness of its back is inestimable.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Nine-Tailed Fox]</p>
<p>—Nine-Tailed Fox humanoid monster.</p>
<p>—Threat level: [Master-rank]</p>
<p>—Apt user of illusion and destruction magic.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Ogre Troll]</p>
<p>—A monstrosity created by fusing an ogre, a troll, and a human.</p>
<p>—Threat level: [Master-rank]</p>
<p>—Supernatural strength.</p>
<p>“All Master-rank threats.”</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk smiled with joy. He always enjoyed fighting strong opponents.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yoo Jinwoong was distorted heavily. It wasn’t because of fear. No matter who his opponent was, he was always ‘enraged’…</p>
<p><em>Guoooo—!</em></p>
<p>…It was then that an unexpected current of magic power shot up.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk, Yoo Jinwoong, and the three humanoid monsters stopped observing each other momentarily and turned to the direction of the magic power surge.</p>
<p>“Steel Spirit….”</p>
<p>A steel-colored magic power was flickering in the sky above Orden’s palace. Yoo Sihyuk and Yoo Jinwoong had both seen this scene when they were young.</p>
<p>It was without doubt Heynckes’s ‘Steel Spirit Aura’.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the Nine Stars’ magic power condensed into one point before erupting into a thunderous boom and striking down on Orden’s royal court.</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAAAA—!</em></p>
<p>Steel descended from the sky.</p>
<p>“Hm… Looks like Old Man Heynckes isn’t so old yet.”</p>
<p>“…Agreed.”</p>
<p>Heynckes’s juniors and Orden’s servants watched the Lord of Steel’s overwhelming display of power in awe.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yun Seung-Ah’s team infiltrated Orden’s research center.</p>
<p>Her team consisted of Yohei, Chae Nayun, Yi Jiyoon, and Shin Jonghak. Their mission was to destroy all ‘humanoid monster synthesis research data’ to prevent further humanoid monsters from appearing.</p>
<p>“Humans! Don’t think you’ll be able to leave alive—!”</p>
<p>But enemies quickly came to hinder them. In less than three minutes after their infiltration, a group of humanoid monsters resembling centaurs charged towards them with giant spears.</p>
<p>“I’ll stop them! Comrades, go do what you must!”</p>
<p>Yohei stopped running and turned around to face them. Before the rest of the team members could say anything, Yohei drank a potion and charged towards the centaurs. With effects from the potion and Yi Jiyoon’s buffs, Yohei turned into a gust of wind that stopped the beasts’ charge.</p>
<p>“Keep running!”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah led the others onward to the research center recorded on their map. Another group of humanoid monsters appeared soon, and this time, Shen Yuan stopped to fight them.</p>
<p>“We all have return scrolls, so we’ll run before it gets too bad. Make sure to complete the mission and avenge the fallen comrades from my country. Tigris might be dead, but all humanoid monsters are the same!” Shen Yuan smiled before jumping into battle.</p>
<p>“…Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The team continued on, running continuously to their destination. They knew they were chased on time, with more and more humanoid monsters sure to come as time passed. It was important to finish this mission as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The path to the research center was like a maze due to various illusion and bewitchment barriers in place. However, Chae Nayun’s incredible intuition managed to lead them in the right direction.</p>
<p>“Over there!”</p>
<p>The words [Research Center] soon appeared in front of them.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>They burst through the door and charged inside.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa… looks like they all escaped.”</p>
<p>The research center was empty, with the researchers clearly having run away, but the team’s goal was destroying the facility. As long as the facility was destroyed, they wouldn’t be able to birth new humanoid monsters until the war ended.</p>
<p>“Start destroying everything you see… kuhuk!”</p>
<p><em>Thwack—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a powerful punch struck Yun Seung-Ah’s stomach. The sudden attack broke her qi reinforcement in an instant, and Yun Seung-Ah fell on her knees.</p>
<p>“U-Unni! You bastard!”</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s magic power surged out, lighting the dark research center and revealing the humanoid monster who ambushed Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s eyes widened immediately.</p>
<p>—Krrrr….</p>
<p>Tigris was standing in front of her.</p>
<p>The humanoid monster who should have been dead was glaring at them while drooling from his mouth and looking dazed.</p>
<p>“Can you see it now? Death is only an obstacle to be overcome for King Orden.”</p>
<p>A deep voice rang out from the faint darkness.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap—</em> Footsteps echoed in the room. The team members turned to the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>“…Park Hanho.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak muttered with his teeth clenched.</p>
<p>The previous chairman of the Temple of Justice, Traitor Park Hanho, walked forward.</p>
<p>“You walked the path of success thanks to my grandfather’s help. This is how you repay your debt?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak cursed as he pointed his Conqueror Spear at him. However, Park Hanho’s expression didn’t change a single bit.</p>
<p>“You are all Heroes, yet you are unaware of how ugly, dirty, and evil they can be. I am here because I am indebted to the Monster King but also to destroy the Association.”</p>
<p>“Chairman… Park Hanho.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah staggered up.</p>
<p>“I understand… your anger, your sadness. I know you would have done anything to save your daugh—”</p>
<p>“There’s no need, I won’t be convinced. Don’t expect anything from me and die like a Hero.”</p>
<p>“No, w-wait—”</p>
<p>“Tigris—!”</p>
<p>Park Hanho shouted Tigris’s name, making him attack immediately. The revived Tigris lacked consciousness, and his body creaked like a wooden puppet. Still, his strength remained.</p>
<p><em>Clang—! Clang—!</em></p>
<p>“Krrrrrrr!”</p>
<p>A fierce battle broke out.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak and Yun Seung-Ah faced Tigris, and Yi Jiyoon merged into the surroundings with her [Stealth] Skill and shot healing arrows.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was thus left to fight Park Hanho by herself.</p>
<p>“Uk—!”</p>
<p>Park Hanho was the former chairman of the Temple of Justice and the owner of ‘steel magic power’, second only to the Lord of Steel himself.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was at a huge disadvantage against him.</p>
<p>“…Chairman, snap out of it! If you got your daughter back, why don’t you take her and run away!?”</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, kuk! Why do you want to… kuk! Raise your daughter among monsters?!”</p>
<p><em>Clang— Clang—!</em></p>
<p>Swords clashed over and over again. Although Chae Nayun was at a disadvantage, she managed to stand her ground with the undefeated swordsmanship of Heynckes. She wasn’t confident in winning, but she was confident in not losing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately…</p>
<p>“Kuaaaaa—!”</p>
<p>The others weren’t doing so well either.</p>
<p>Tigris was releasing his full strength, and in such a small space, he was akin to a death god. Shin Jonghak and Yun Seung-Ah weren’t given any chance to counterattack.</p>
<p>“Kyaak!”</p>
<p>In the end, Yi Jiyoon, who was in hiding, was caught. Tigris cut off her arm without a moment of hesitation, and Yi Jiyoon fell to the ground in pain.</p>
<p>“Aaaah, it hurts… it hurts…!”</p>
<p>“J-Jiyoon!”</p>
<p>“Where are you looking?”</p>
<p>While Chae Nayun was distracted, Park Hanho’s attack dug into Chae Nayun.</p>
<p><em>Chwaak—!</em></p>
<p>With her sides cut, Chae Nayun fell backward. Hot pain spread through her body, and Park Hanho quickly followed up with more attacks.</p>
<p>“Aggh—!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun blocked Park Hanho’s attacks without having the chance to deal with her wound.</p>
<p><em>Clang, clang, clang!</em></p>
<p>Their swords clashed as sparks of ember shot up. Chae Nayun started to slow down from the loss of blood.</p>
<p>“You’re getting slower.”</p>
<p>Park Hanho didn’t give her a single opportunity to rest. His sword attacked Chae Nayun in every direction. The attacks that Chae Nayun could block at first started making cuts on her body.</p>
<p>“Kuk…”</p>
<p>As she was being driven into a corner, suddenly, strange windows popped up in the corner of her eyes.</p>
<p>[You used ‘Lv.5 Invitation Letter to the Loveroom’!]</p>
<p>[Although it was activated by someone else, because it was not activated by a Player, the ownership is returned to you.]</p>
<p>[Enter the nickname of the person you wish to invite.]</p>
<p>[Warning! A battle is taking place. Forced summon is not possible.]</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>‘What happened? Wasn’t the invitation letter in my pocket?’</p>
<p><em>Chwaak—</em></p>
<p>While Chae Nayun was wondering what happened, Park Hanho’s sword shot towards her thigh, and it was then that Chae Nayun came to a realization.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>‘It got torn during battle!’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 297. Orden Annihilation Operation (3)</p>
<p>[Orden’s Palace]</p>
<p>At the heart of the palace where the Monster King resided, two rays of magic power descended from the ceiling like lightning.</p>
<p>Orden calmly studied the intruders from his throne. One was surrounded in silver armor and the other was dressed in a simple martial arts uniform. The striking contrast between the two men, in addition to their superhuman strength, aroused Orden’s interest.</p>
<p>“…Heroes, I presume?” Orden’s deep voice rang out.</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>Heynckes nodded and clutched his sword.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul flipped his folding fan open.</p>
<p>They had no intention of holding a conversation with Orden, but Orden seemed to have quite a few questions for them.</p>
<p>“I heard a select number of Heroes are called the Nine Stars. The name apparently refers to the nine saints. Are you the members of the Nine Stars?”</p>
<p>Heynckes shook his head at Orden’s question. “Three of the Nine Stars are already dead, one ran away, and the remaining four went into hiding. I’m afraid the Nine Stars no longer exist."</p>
<p>The public was not made aware of the deaths of Nine Stars. The Association publicly announced the heroic death of Shin Myungchul but concealed the deaths of other members who died of old age, side-effects, and illnesses. The Association wanted the Nine Stars to remain flawless to the eyes of the public.</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“But that’s no reason for you to be disappointed. I believe we’ll be enough to entertain you.”</p>
<p>Orden looked at Chae Joochul. Chae Joochul’s eyes were gleaming with dark magic power. The Immortal was now gathering up all of Africa’s vital energy while Heynckes bought him time.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’ll be fun.” Saying so, Orden grinned.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Tzzzt—!</em></p>
<p>A fierce whirlwind surrounded Orden’s throne. Flame blazed up inside the biting wind. Orden dispelled the wind with his magic power.</p>
<p><em>Chweek—</em></p>
<p>Chae Joochul waved his fan. This time, electric currents rushed towards Orden. The attack poured in from all sides.</p>
<p>Orden willingly got up from the throne.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Heynckes unleashed his Steel Spirit as he shot towards Orden. Orden witnessed the tremendous amount of magic power surrounding the Steel Spirit Sword.</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>Heynckes’s sword struck Orden’s fist.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something strange happened. The gauntlet surrounding Orden’s fist disintegrated on its own and was absorbed into the Steel Spirit.</p>
<p>This was the power of Steel Spirit that prevailed over every metal.</p>
<p>At that moment, Orden gave a small smile.</p>
<p>He had never felt so pressured before.</p>
<p>The thrilling sensation at his hand began to crawl up his arm.</p>
<p>His heart boiled with fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Immersed in a pleasant stimulation—</p>
<p>Orden was confident this fight would be one he could truly enjoy…..</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Please enter the nickname of the Player you wish to summon.]</p>
<p>Though she somehow managed to activate the item, she couldn’t possibly type in the middle of battle. Chae Nayun was busy just guarding herself against Park Hanho’s attacks.</p>
<p>Park Hanho was ruthless. His sword reinforcement was imbued with the indestructible attribute, and his unbreakable magic power made him shine in both offense and defense.</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun knew that the longer the fight prolonged, the less likely she was to win. For that reason, she instantaneously gathered all of her magic power in her sword.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s Gift— ‘Sea of Magic Power’ activated.</p>
<p>Her Gift eliminated all capacity limitations for magic power. It was one of the strongest sword-related Gifts.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun gathered the boundless magic power to her sword, even turning off her qi reinforcement. Even Park Hanho couldn’t help but hesitate, and though it was only for a moment, Chae Nayun didn't miss the opportunity and immediately exploded her magic power.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>Her magic power turned into a huge pillar of fire that quickly spread to the rest of the laboratory. The explosion of magic power destroyed all of the lab equipment, and the impact sent Park Hanho flying across the room.</p>
<p>Now was her only chance.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun quickly activated the invitation letter.</p>
<p>[Extra 7]</p>
<p>[Warning! You’re not allowed to summon forcefully when you’re in a battle zone.]</p>
<p>[Asking the target for the permission to summon….]</p>
<p><em>Crack—!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, she heard the cracking of bones.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun felt a blow on her side. Yet there was no pain. This was a bad sign as it meant that her entire nervous system had been damaged along with her spine.</p>
<p>With a numbing sensation, Chae Nayun was thrown into the air.</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>She crashed into a wall and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Her arms and legs wouldn’t move. Blood spurted out of her mouth.</p>
<p>She received a critical injury.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun looked at the figure across the room with hazy eyes.</p>
<p>Amidst the crimson flames and the black smoke, she saw Tigris, the humanoid monster who attacked her. His eyes gave off a horrid glow.</p>
<p>—You managed to achieve your initial goal.</p>
<p>A voice seeped into her consciousness, but she wasn’t sure where it was coming from. The fire began to melt the floor tiles, and she could feel the heat on her skin. She felt as if her consciousness was melting.</p>
<p>—Die with pride.</p>
<p>She saw Park Hanho raise his sword. Shin Jonghak and Yun Seung-Ah rushed to save her, only to be blocked by Tigris.</p>
<p>The sword descended slowly.</p>
<p>She felt as if the whole world had slowed down.</p>
<p>Everything was in a slow motion…. It all felt surreal.</p>
<p>Suddenly a question arose in her mind.</p>
<p>‘Shouldn’t my life flash before my eyes right about now? But it’s not, which must mean that I’m not destined to die here. I still have so much I need to do.</p>
<p>…No.</p>
<p>More importantly, I can’t help but be angry at myself.</p>
<p>Even after all that training, this is all I can do.</p>
<p>I spent so long training under Yoo Sihyuk and Heynckes to become strong. To be able to endure everything. It wasn’t so that I could fall at a place like this….’</p>
<p>Chae Nayun recalled the promise she made to herself.</p>
<p>She clenched her fists without giving up. Intense anger and a sense of resolution boiled in her heart.</p>
<p><em>Wooong….</em></p>
<p>Maybe it was the magic power responding to her will. A mysterious magic power began to gather around her clenched fists. Contrary to the standard azure magic power, this one glowed in all sorts of colors.</p>
<p>The colors reflected against each other, leaving only white in the end.</p>
<p>The white magic power encompassed Chae Nayun’s whole body.</p>
<p>This was by far the brightest and the strongest ‘qi reinforcement’.</p>
<p>And, at that moment.</p>
<p><em>Woooong—</em> With a strange vibration, a portal appeared in the center of the flames. Chae Nayun, Park Hanho, and Tigris all turned their gazes to the portal.</p>
<p>There were two people inside. Unfortunately, due to the thick flames and the heavy smoke, Chae Nayun couldn’t see their faces.</p>
<p>However, she was sure of one thing….</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>She heard an explosion, then smelled the combustion of magic power.</p>
<p>—Kuek!</p>
<p>At the same time, she heard Park Hanho’s scream.</p>
<p>Their fight was put on hold.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap—</em> The sound of footsteps disrupted the temporary silence.</p>
<p>The footsteps stopped at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun barely managed to raise her head and look up.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin was there.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Basilisk Dungeon Exit]</p>
<p>I gathered up any and everything that could possibly be useful and left the dungeon. ‘Maybe I should head over to Orden’s Palace—’ I thought when something unexpected happened.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>A strange energy, one that was neither magic power nor spirit power, appeared before my eyes in the shape of an ellipse about 2m tall.</p>
<p>“…What the heck is this?”</p>
<p>If I had to say, it looked like a portal.</p>
<p>I frowned as I carefully scrutinized it. Suddenly, a system window popped up.</p>
<p>[Lv.5 Invitation Letter to the Love Room — Nayunjajangman wishes to invite you.]</p>
<p>[Warning! NayunJajangman is currently in an extremely dangerous battle zone.]</p>
<p>[This portal will disappear in 5 minutes.]</p>
<p>The first word I saw was ‘Nayunjajangman’, and I subconsciously flinched. I threw a glance at Jin Sahyuk and proceeded to read the rest of the messages.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>—Nayunjajangman is currently in an extremely dangerous battle zone.</p>
<p>This sentence weighed heavily on my mind.</p>
<p>I had the feeling that Chae Nayun was trying to summon me using an effective good from the Tower of Wish….</p>
<p>…I looked at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>She was still swooning over the [Alexander III’s Cape].</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>I tapped Jin Sahyuk on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“What do you want…. Wha, What’s that?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk widened her eyes, only now realizing the sudden appearance of a portal.</p>
<p>I pointed at the portal and said, “Why don’t we go in together? I think this is connected to Orden’s palace.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked into the portal and carefully studied it until her eyes were tinged with blue by the portal’s glow.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shook her head.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I can tell from the direction of magic currents that this portal is a one-way portal designed for one traveler. Two people can’t travel through it.”</p>
<p>“…Wow. You analyzed the portal that quickly?”</p>
<p>“I’m more amazing than you think.”</p>
<p>I let Jin Sahyuk relish her moment of glory and activated my Authority.</p>
<p>With the last update, I was now able to activate [Setting Intervention] without a medium such as a smartwatch.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Portal to the Love Room] [Special]</p>
<p>—A portal created by ‘Nayunjajangman’ to summon ‘Extra 7’.</p>
<p>—Only ‘Extra 7’ can use this portal.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>All I needed to do was to change the second description to 「Only ‘Extra 7’ and his companion can use this portal」….</p>
<p>[35 SP is required to change the setting.]</p>
<p>The cost was only 35 SP.</p>
<p>I modified the setting, and immediately, the shape of the portal changed.</p>
<p>“…What the.”</p>
<p>Having noticed the change in the portal, Jin Sahyuk raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“How did you do that? The fundamental structure of magic power changed.”</p>
<p>“How’s that? Now two people can use this, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but this doesn’t make any sen—”</p>
<p>“Geez, you talk a lot..”</p>
<p>I check the remaining SP.</p>
<p>[SP 7,045]</p>
<p>I’d gathered quite a bit of SP before I knew it.</p>
<p>Thinking back, I’ve accomplished quite a lot recently. I infiltrated Orden’s Palace, rescued the spy, and defeated the Basilisk….</p>
<p>Anyways, before entering the portal, I decided to create a new Gift. It made sense to prepare another weapon before going into enemy territory.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t take long. I had thought of this Gift a long time ago, even before [Buster Call]. All I needed to do was to copy and paste the setting for the new [Active Gift] that was already in my head.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Constraints and Amplifications] [Intermediate-rank]</p>
<p>—Constraints</p>
<p>*Apply temporary ‘constraints’ to the user’s body.</p>
<p>—Amplification</p>
<p>*Temporarily increase the user’s strength in proportion to the applied ‘constraints’.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The gist of this Gift was simple.</p>
<p>Lose your left arm, strengthen your right arm.</p>
<p>Lose your eyesight, heighten your other senses.</p>
<p>The reason I came up with this Gift was because I relied on weapons completely in a fight.</p>
<p>I could let someone break my hand, but I couldn’t risk them breaking the [Desert Eagle] or [Temujin’s Bow Blessed By Horus].</p>
<p>With this Gift, I planned to sacrifice my left arm to enhance [Desert Eagle], and my sight to strengthen [Temujin’s Bow Blessed By Horus].</p>
<p>I came up with this Gift to enhance my weapons, not me.</p>
<p>[You need 4000 SP to create this Gift.]</p>
<p>[Would you like to proceed?]</p>
<p>4000 SP was only the bare minimum.</p>
<p>I invested all the remaining SP to further enhance the Gift.</p>
<p>[You spent a total of 7045 SP to create the Gift ‘Constraints and Amplifications’.]</p>
<p>[Congratulations! You have been blessed with good luck again.]</p>
<p>[10% of your investment has been returned to you. The rank of your Gift has increased drastically.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Constraints and Amplifications] [high-rank]</p>
<p>—Constraints</p>
<p>*Apply temporary ‘constraints’ to the user’s body.</p>
<p>—Amplifications</p>
<p>*Temporarily increase the target’s strength in proportion to the applied ‘constraints’.</p>
<p>—Profitable Exchange</p>
<p>*Increase ‘Amplification’ performance by 77%.</p>
<p>—Side-Effect Alleviation</p>
<p>*The side-effects of this Gift, including the cooldown period, are slightly improved.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…Good.”</p>
<p>I was happy with the results.</p>
<p>In addition to the new Gift, I made [Basilisk’s Poisonous Shotgun Shell] with the SP I got back. I then took out the Desert Eagle, switched it to a shotgun, loaded it with the new bullets, and activated [Constraints and Amplifications].</p>
<p>My constraints were my ‘left arm’ and my ‘left eye’.</p>
<p>The target for amplification was the ‘Desert Eagle’.</p>
<p>At the next moment, I could feel my field of vision shrinking. Fortunately, one eye was all I needed to activate Thousand-Mile Eyes.</p>
<p>It was a bit uncomfortable not being able to use my left arm, but using only one arm to shoot didn’t decrease its power whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>With the gun in my hand, I pointed at the portal with my chin. But Jin Sahyuk only stared at me with a strange look on her face.</p>
<p>“…What’s that?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“What happened to your left arm?”</p>
<p>“Ah, this?”</p>
<p>My left arm was limp.</p>
<p>It had also turned completely black because of the constraints.</p>
<p>“I can’t use it right now.”</p>
<p>“What? What does that mean—”</p>
<p>“Shush.”</p>
<p>I aimed my gun at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Just go in. It’s going to hurt if you get shot.”</p>
<p>“…Psycho.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk put on a sour face but jumped into the portal anyways. I followed behind her.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh—</em></p>
<p>I expected the portal to take us to a heated battlefield, but I didn’t expect it to be this different.</p>
<p>We were surrounded by fire in a laboratory filled with the smell of blood.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Flames blazed up as if trying to devour us alive.</p>
<p>However, the fire was the least of my concerns right now.</p>
<p>I saw Park Hanho pointing his sword at Chae Nayun who was lying on the floor.</p>
<p>I immediately activated [Bullet Time] and [Pinnacle-rank Instant Acceleration].</p>
<p>Even the flames stopped moving as the world slowed down. I immediately infused all of the remaining streaks of Stigma into my gun.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>The Stigma-filled shotgun began to glow green. It was the color of the [Basilisk’s Shotgun Shell] that was loaded in the gun.</p>
<p>I had no reason to hesitate.</p>
<p>I held the gun with one hand, aimed it at Park Hanho, and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>…<em>Click.</em></p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>The poisonous bullet blasted out from the muzzle of the gun.</p>
<p>The massive wind pressure pushed not only me but also Jin Sahyuk back.</p>
<p>“Uwoaah—” Jin Sahyuk yelled before she disappeared from my view.</p>
<p>“Aah!”</p>
<p>Even I hadn’t expected this much power.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Aether encompassed me before I got hurt.</p>
<p>The bullet continued to travel forward, swallowing Park Hanho entirely.</p>
<p>The blast resembled the Basilisk’s breath attack.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 298. Orden Annihilation Operation (5)</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I searched for the right words to say to Chae Nayun. She looked like she didn’t understand what was going on at all.</p>
<p>The look on her face was quite funny and made me want to say something to her, but the situation wasn’t quite appropriate.</p>
<p>Tigris’s [Formless Tiger Punch] flew at me.</p>
<p>But I didn’t need to avoid it. Jin Sahyuk’s Reality Manipulation neutralized the punch.</p>
<p>“Snap out of it.” Jin Sahyuk muttered.</p>
<p>I nodded, picked up the Desert Eagle, and took out a pinnacle-grade potion from my pocket. It should be capable of quickly curing Chae Nayun’s wounds.</p>
<p>I opened the bottle, set it down on the ground beside Chae Nayun and looked around.</p>
<p>Park Hanho, who had been struck by the poisonous bullet, was groaning in agony as he healed himself. Tigris was glaring at me with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>“…Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>It was then that I heard Yun Seung-Ah’s voice. She and Shin Jonghak were staring at me. But when I turned my gaze to them, Tigris started raving again, and I had to activate ‘Bullet Time’.</p>
<p>Though time slowed down, Tigris was still fast.</p>
<p>I chased him with my eyes and held up my gun.</p>
<p>In this gun was the [Basilisk’s Poisonous Bullet] made from over 100 poison crystals, enhanced with [Random Consolidation System] and [Constraints and Amplifications]. If I could somehow manage to get a clean hit, even Tigris wouldn’t be able to keep a straight face anymore….</p>
<p>I exchanged glances with the two comrades, and we moved systematically.</p>
<p>First, Shin Jonghak swung his spear at Park Hanho. Yun Seung-Ah blocked Tigris, Jin Sahyuk protected Chae Nayun while she put out the fire, and I aimed my gun at Tigris.</p>
<p><em>Click—</em></p>
<p>I calculated the direction and the speed of the bullet, the location and the movement of the target, and pulled the trigger at the most ‘correct’ timing.</p>
<p><em>Pang—!</em></p>
<p>There was a short and plain sound of a gun.</p>
<p>The bullet first traveled in a straight line but soon curved down, setting its course towards Tigris’s heel.</p>
<p>Curve Shots were now as easy as breathing to me.</p>
<p>Tigris tried to block my bullet, of course, but Yun Seung-Ah didn’t let him.</p>
<p>Her White Flower Sword split into many different branches like a blossoming flower and shackled Tigris.</p>
<p>—Kuaak!</p>
<p>As a result, the bullet struck Tigris in the heel. Tigris, now unable to move the lower half of his body, fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“…Whew.”</p>
<p>It was then that I deactivated [Constraints and Amplifications]. I had only fired two bullets but a part of my right arm had been damaged.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk. I’ll leave the rest to you.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk first glanced at me then at Chae Nayun behind me before hesitantly making her way towards Tigris and Park Hanho.</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, an unexpected sound of notification rang out. It came from my smartwatch.</p>
<p>—Lotus, where are you? We’re with your people.</p>
<p>The message was from Wicked.</p>
<p>By ‘your people’, she probably meant the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>—Stay with them. I have a business to take care of right now. I’ll head over soon.</p>
<p>I activated [Buster Call] right after I sent the reply. I made up for the Stigma I was lacking with [Overclock].</p>
<p><em>Jiiing….</em></p>
<p>The magic power from my smartwatch penetrated the ceiling and reached the sky.</p>
<p>[…This is Horner from Genkelope. I’m responding to the master’s request!]</p>
<p>After I finished contacting the Vessel, I turned around.</p>
<p>My heart sank immediately.</p>
<p>A familiar figure was standing in front of me.</p>
<p>“…Hey.”</p>
<p>The clear, high-pitched voice I had heard countless times during my Cube days.</p>
<p>For a brief moment, I felt as if I had become a student at Cube again.</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on?” Chae Nayun asked, obviously confused.</p>
<p>I looked at Chae Nayun in silence.</p>
<p>“…What, you’re Extra 7?” Chae Nayun asked again.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“…I can’t believe this. You even lied to me about your age? You’re really something.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun ran a hand through her hair. She was already tearing up. In her eyes were countless emotions including embarrassment and sorrow.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun didn’t say anything else.. From her distraught expression, I could tell she was thinking of everything that happened between us in the past.</p>
<p>So I spoke first.</p>
<p>“Have you been well?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s face contorted to a frown.</p>
<p>I immediately regretted asking that question. I should’ve just kept my mouth shut if I had nothing to say. I always found it difficult to keep my composure in front of her.</p>
<p>“…Have I been well?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun came closer and looked up at me.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>She grabbed me by the shoulders in the same way she would grab me by the collar.</p>
<p>“…How could I have been well?”</p>
<p>Saying so, Chae Nayun rested her head on my chest. It was slightly heavy and very painful.</p>
<p>“How could I?”</p>
<p>She muttered.</p>
<p>Hundreds of words were condensed into that one sentence.</p>
<p>I didn’t need to hear anything else.</p>
<p>We stood still. We knew this wasn’t the right time or place, so we only looked at each other in silence and….</p>
<p>“Get a room.”</p>
<p>…getting a room… No, wait, that’s not right.</p>
<p>My head cooled down as if it had suddenly been pushed into a bucket of ice. Chae Nayun and I turned to where the voice had come from.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk, Yun Seung-Ah, and Shin Jonghak, who had taken care of the situation, were staring at us.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Palace]</p>
<p>“You won’t be able to escape.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kim Suho, who had entered the Palace before anybody else, was locked up in Doloren’s barrier. It was ‘Doloren’s Concert Hall’, the same barrier that once trapped Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“I fixed it to perfection after the last breakout.”</p>
<p>“…It won’t matter if I win.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho glared at Doloren and clutched Misteltein. Doloren, however, only smiled.</p>
<p>“You can’t escape from here even if you win. But you won’t win anyway.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see…?”</p>
<p>It was then that zombies rose from the ground surrounding the concert hall.</p>
<p><em>Ssss….</em></p>
<p>The zombies emitted cold air.</p>
<p>But it didn’t take Kim Suho long to realize that they were just a front to conceal something more dangerous. His heightened sensation quickly discovered the ‘something’ hidden in the crowd.</p>
<p>An invisible humanoid monster.</p>
<p>The mutant combination of a ghost and a human.</p>
<p>It was ‘Xphil’, another one of Orden’s Four Generals.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think there’s just too many of you? It’s almost 1 against 300. Seems a little extreme.”</p>
<p>With a smile, Kim Suho raised his magic power. The magic power of the Sword Saint began to glow blue as it encompassed its owner.</p>
<p>“So what if it’s extreme? It’s my motto to always try my best.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded.</p>
<p>“Actually, that doesn’t really matter. I’m not alone either.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>The moment Doloren frowned, Kim Suho took out the [Summon Ticket] he had acquired from the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>This ticket allowed him to summon one of the Tower’s NPCs as his ally.</p>
<p>As soon as Kim Suho injected his magic power, the summon ticket turned to ashes.</p>
<p>“Wait, that’s cheating-”</p>
<p>The NPC Kim Suho wished to summon using this [Summon Ticket] was the witch who once served as the Demon King’s secretary. As someone who excelled in magic and spells, she would be the perfect opponent for Doloren.</p>
<p><em>Tzzzzt—!</em></p>
<p>The summon ticket emitted powerful magic power that traveled through time and space to call for a certain existence inside the Tower.</p>
<p>The existence answered the call immediately… and appeared on Earth.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Kim Suho turned his gaze to the NPC who appeared inside the whirlwind of magic power.</p>
<p>Pale skin, dark hair. She gave off a dangerous, ominous vibe.</p>
<p>“…It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>She looked at Kim Suho and smiled.</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded and said, “I can skip the explanation, right?”</p>
<p>The witch looked around the place she had been summoned to.</p>
<p>She was inside a strange barrier.</p>
<p>Having understood the situation, the witch turned her gaze to the humanoid monster who was the owner of this barrier.</p>
<p>Doloren flinched and the witch gave a distorted smile.</p>
<p>“…Yes. Rest assured, it’s my specialty to educate people like her.”</p>
<p>Vicious demonic energy started to gather around the witch’s hands.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Outside the Palace in the fields]</p>
<p>“…I think we’re about done.”</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk and Yoo Jinwoong’s battle was coming to an end. The Master-rank monsters, including the Nine-tailed Fox, Croxus, and Ogre Troll, had already been defeated by the two Yoos. Not only were they weaker than Yoo Sihyuk and Yoo Jinwoong, but they were also much less experienced than the two Heroes who had lived through countless battles.</p>
<p>“Should we head to the throne room now?”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong nodded at Yoo Sihyuk’s question. They knew Orden was not an easy target even for Heynckes and Chae Joochul. He was even stronger than ‘Jörmungandr’, who for a long time had been considered the strongest monster in history.</p>
<p>“But when will we get through that?”</p>
<p><em>Crack, crack—</em> Yoo Jinwoong mumbled as he loosened his neck joint.</p>
<p>Thousands of monsters were filling up the field in front of them.</p>
<p>“Hm…. Maybe a bomb will fall from the sky…?” Yoo Sihyuk muttered.</p>
<p>Perhaps, God heard his wishes.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, a portal appeared above. The giant ellipse covered half the area of the entire sky.</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk knew what it was. He had seen it before in the papers.</p>
<p>Its name was ‘Genkelope’s Battle Cruiser’.</p>
<p>Just as he had expected, from the portal came a battle cruiser that was even more powerful than before, accompanied by the roaring sound of engines and yells from people on board.</p>
<p>“It looks like… they’ll help us.”</p>
<p>The battlecruiser responded immediately to Yoo Sihyuk’s words.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaaa</em></p>
<p>The bombardment continued as hundreds of combat planes departed from the deck. Thousands of ‘Genkelope soldiers’ descended from the ship.</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk watched them and chuckled.</p>
<p>“Let’s head to the throne room.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong nodded in silence.</p>
<p>The two men immediately turned into a wind that rushed towards the throne room.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Orden’s Throne Room]</p>
<p>‘…Humans can be so different,’ Orden thought as he fought against the two humans.</p>
<p>One human came at Orden with all his strength while the other concealed it as much as possible.</p>
<p>The man in armor poured his soul into each swing of his sword, but the man in the martial arts uniform did not.</p>
<p>The former proudly displayed his convictions yet the latter operated solely on logic.</p>
<p>The contrasting qualities of the two humans amazed Orden.</p>
<p>Orden wanted to define the nature of humans.</p>
<p>Some humans were loyal, some were disloyal. Some agonized over what was righteous when others blindly chased after money and fame.</p>
<p>Humanoid monsters were different from humans in that regard. Monsters always acted according to their instincts. Genes were very important to humanoid monsters, for they determined everything about them.</p>
<p>For example, humanoid monsters created from the DNA of rattlesnakes and lizards were highly intelligent but tended to betray easily when their safety was at stake, and humanoid monsters created from the DNA of Mountain Tyrants were physically strong but always violent and oppressive.</p>
<p>It was clear that monsters could never become humans.</p>
<p>But Orden didn’t want to give up. He wanted to prove that humanoid monsters and humans were no different from each other.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>‘How can we be so different?’</p>
<p>Orden was overcome with profound grief.</p>
<p>At the same time, he remembered when he first realized his own intelligence, when he couldn’t be understood by both humans and monsters, when he suffered alone in endless solitude, cursing his own existence.</p>
<p>‘…Monsters can’t become humans, and humans are not monsters.’</p>
<p>Alas, what a tragic proposition it was.</p>
<p>In great sadness and vanity, Orden emitted his magic power. It was the first magic power to gain the attribute of ‘chaos’, one that Orden realized in the midst of his self-reflection.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa…</em></p>
<p>Just as Orden’s chaos was about to explode….</p>
<p><em>Krrr—!</em></p>
<p>….Eight wolves jumped at Orden and bit his limbs. Red electric currents enveloped his waist. The attack came from someone other than Chae Joochul and Heynckes.</p>
<p>But Orden was unaffected by it all. He nonchalantly shoved the wolves aside, crushed the electricity, then gathered magic power in his hands to explode everything.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaa….</em></p>
<p>This time, however, golden reinforced sword qi approached Orden. It wrecked everything in its course as it traveled forward. When it finally reached Orden’s magic power, it cut the abnormally dense ‘chaos’ in half.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The death of ‘chaos’ was unquestionably clear.</p>
<p>Orden had never been so shocked before.</p>
<p>He turned to where the reinforced sword qi had come from.</p>
<p>There— at the entrance of the throne room stood a man engulfed in golden energy.</p>
<p>It was from Kim Suho.</p>
<p>After defeating two of Orden’s Four Elite Soldiers—’Doloren’ and ‘Xphil’—Kim Suho and the witch finally arrived at the throne room.</p>
<p>However, Kim Suho wasn’t the only human who had come to see Orden.</p>
<p><em>Chweeek—!</em></p>
<p>A magic arrow flew in from somewhere and pierced Orden’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The arrow belonged to the Divine Archer.</p>
<p>There wasn’t just one. Thousands of arrows carrying the purest magic power fell from the sky. Even Orden couldn’t stay indifferent to an attack of such magnitude.</p>
<p>“———!”</p>
<p>Regardless, Orden dispelled all of them with a single cry.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, another cry rang out.</p>
<p>“Orden—!”</p>
<p>The roar shook the palace.</p>
<p>Orden slowly raised his head.</p>
<p>A giant man was descending from the ceiling.</p>
<p>“I, Cheok Jungyeong, have come—!”</p>
<p>With a self-absorbed cry, Cheok Jungyeong swung his fist at Orden.</p>
<p>KOOOONG—!</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong’s fist reached Orden’s forehead.</p>
<p>It was a direct hit.</p>
<p>A huge shockwave spread from the point of contact and Cheok Jungyeong burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Uhahaha—! He’s a lot weaker than I thought…?”</p>
<p>Orden grabbed Cheok Jungyeong’s arm which was still clutching Orden’s face.</p>
<p>He then flipped and smashed Cheok Jungyeong into the ground in one swift motion, as if he was rolling a bowling ball.</p>
<p>KWAAANG—!</p>
<p>“Uwa….”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong wasn’t even given the time to react.</p>
<p>The result was a strike.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong, who descended from the ceiling, was thrown out of the room moments after he made his entrance.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Orden rose from the throne and looked around.</p>
<p>Only then did he recognize the Heroes.</p>
<p>Aileen, Yi Yongha, Kim Youngjin, Shin Jonghak, Chae Nayun, Yun Seung Ah….</p>
<p>He hadn’t noticed any of them before because he was too engrossed in his fight.</p>
<p>Dozens of Heroes who had infiltrated into his palace were now gathering in front of him.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 299. Orden Annihilation Operation (6)</p>
<p>…I can’t remember when, but I started seeing memories of the past when I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>My mom, who would smile brightly with me in her embrace, the garden we used to stroll around in, and the sight of her covered in blood, dead. The rain that fell during the funeral, my older brother who held my hand as he tried to hold back his tears, and my young self who made a pledge in front of her grave…</p>
<p>That was when I decided to become a Hero.</p>
<p>I entered the Agent Military Academy for that goal. But one day, Heroes I didn’t know came to visit me. I could still remember the black uniform they were wearing. It was the uniform worn to mourn the loss of a comrade. They told me that Oppa was in a ‘hopeless comatose state’.</p>
<p>Shock and sorrow overwhelmed me, but I still didn’t give up.</p>
<p>The enemies were still alive, out there, roaming about. I believed Oppa would recover, that if I worked hard to become a Hero, he would wake up and hold me in his arms.</p>
<p>With determination and hope, I entered ‘Cube’.</p>
<p>That was when I first met him. He was rather strange. He brought up Oppa during our first meeting and picked a fight with me. He called me a hopeless archer and told me to change to a sword.</p>
<p>I hated him to death. I wanted to beat him to a pulp if possible.</p>
<p>But time passed and before I realized, I came to not dislike him. In fact, I found myself constantly staring at him. I wanted him to be by my side.</p>
<p>…I still didn’t know why.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin, a man of mysteries, the bastard who killed Oppa without an explanation. Though I now knew his actions were justified, though I knew he chose to remain silent and to bear the pain in my place, if someone asked me if I ‘hated’ him, well…</p>
<p>Yes, I probably hate him to death.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I might love him to death.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I glanced back as I continued to run. Kim Hajin was running a bit slower than me. He didn’t run away, and by the looks of it, he didn’t plan on running away either.</p>
<p>So I breathed a sigh of relief. I had many questions to ask him, but just as he said, the situation wasn’t quite right.</p>
<p>We continued to run. Eventually, we arrived at Orden’s throne room. A terrifying mixture of energy undulated from Orden and the Heroes inside. We halted our steps nearby.</p>
<p>“…Can you continue?”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin asked me. His voice was softer than usual. Then, a question suddenly emerged in my mind. How did Kim Hajin sound like normally?</p>
<p>“Of course, don’t you run away.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin made a grim smile at my reply. His sorrowful smile stung my heart a bit.</p>
<p>“I can’t run away. You put a card on me.”</p>
<p>“…Oh, yeah.”</p>
<p>8-star card, [Infinite Communication]. I suspected that Extra 7 had some sort of a relationship with Kim Hajin, but it turned out they were one and the same. In other words, it was Kim Hajin who saved me in the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>…That stung my heart again.</p>
<p>“Hey, you—”</p>
<p>Just as I was about to say something…</p>
<p>—Uwoaaaah…!</p>
<p>A large lump of flesh suddenly shot out of the throne room door. The lump of flesh, which was likely to be a human, rolled like a bowling ball and crashed into a support pillar.</p>
<p>“…Who’s that?”</p>
<p>As I furrowed my brows, I noticed Kim Hajin flinch.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that him? The crazy bastard who calls himself Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
<p>“…Uh, yeah, it is.”</p>
<p>“You know him too?”</p>
<p>“Um, I’ve seen him a few times in the Tower….”</p>
<p>It was then. Kim Hajin’s calm demeanor suddenly changed. Just like a man who saw a scene of horror, his face distorted.</p>
<p>“Hey, Jin Sahyuk!” He yelled Jin Sahyuk’s name.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned and retorted, “What now?”</p>
<p>“Can you make a bunker with Reality Manipulation?”</p>
<p>“…Bunker?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, something that can withstand a nuclear bomb….”</p>
<p>I didn’t know what he was talking about, but I happened to have something like that.</p>
<p>“Bunker? I think I have one.”</p>
<p>I took out a card. It was the 8-star card I obtained along with [Infinite Communication].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Miracle Bunker] [8-star] Effective Good</p>
<p>—Constructs ‘Miracle Bunker’ in the designated area for 48 hours.</p>
<p>—This bunker can ignore one, huge impact.</p>
<p>- Forceful Summon – You can forcefully summon up to 30 allies who are in danger.</p>
<p>- Advantageous Time Flow – 10 seconds inside the bunker is equivalent to 1 second outside.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“But what do you need a bunker for so suddenly?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin’s eyes widened, and he quickly snatched the card out of my hand. </p>
<p>He activated it immediately, then said with a smile, “I saw the future with my unique skill.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Throne Room]</p>
<p>Steel Spirit Heynckes, Immortal Chae Joochul, Spirit Speech Master Aileen, Wolf of Valhalla Yoo Sihyuk, Blitzkrieg Yoo Jinwoong, Divine Archer Jin Seyeon, Sword Saint Kim Suho, Weapon Master Kim Youngjin….</p>
<p>Many Heroes were gathered in the throne room of the Monster King. They all shared a common goal – to kill Orden.</p>
<p>“…Monster King Orden.”</p>
<p>Before the final battle began, Heynckes called the king’s name. Orden granted him permission to speak by remaining silent.</p>
<p>“Why do you seek to conquer humans?”</p>
<p>That was Heynckes’s first question.</p>
<p>Orden replied lightly, “Because they cannot coexist with me.”</p>
<p>“…And why would that be?” That was Heynckes’s second question.</p>
<p>Orden replied after a brief silence, “Can you humans live in a world ruled under monkeys? Can you give up your living space to them and watch them blabber in conceit?”</p>
<p>Orden couldn’t clearly define the feelings he had towards humanity. But he knew that ‘coexistence’ was nothing but an illusion. Orden couldn’t stand the world ruled by humans, and the humans undoubtedly saw him as a threat.</p>
<p>“…So there’s no room for negotiation.”</p>
<p>This time, a somewhat childish voice rang out. It belonged to the commander of the Special Task Force, Aileen.</p>
<p>She walked up and stood at the center of the throne room.</p>
<p>“Indeed.” Orden nodded. “Humanoid monsters and humans cannot coexist. That was how we were created.”</p>
<p>Orden gave a resolute conclusion. In response, the Heroes raised their weapons and pointed them at Orden.</p>
<p>Orden looked down at them from his throne and fell in thought.</p>
<p>Such was the nature of humans. They were extremely individualistic, yet when they came together under a common goal, they could have such a powerful will.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly the biggest and most critical difference between humanoid monsters and humans.</p>
<p>“…I understand now.”</p>
<p>“Understand what?”</p>
<p>The Monster King looked down at the humans with a sharper look. He felt something boiling inside his heart. It could be rage, sorrow, resignation, or excitement. No matter the case, Orden gathered up the emotion squirming around in his heart and spat it out.</p>
<p>“My name is Orden—!”</p>
<p>His roar shook the earth and rang out across the sky.</p>
<p>“I am— the king of monsters—!”</p>
<p>The wave of magic power burst out from the king’s body.</p>
<p><em>Guooooo…!</em></p>
<p>The resonance of magic power destroyed the earth and caused the sky to change color.</p>
<p>Kim Suho swung his sword at the ‘chaos’ that was forming. But at that moment, a gust of wind struck his strike down.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>“Kururu….”</p>
<p>Orden’s most loyal servant, a humanoid monster resembling a praying mantis, Kurukuru, appeared. Kurukuru shot towards Kim Suho and swung his front leg.</p>
<p>“Kururu!”</p>
<p>With an inestimable speed, hundreds of scythes slashed down in less than a second. Kurukuru gave his all to hinder Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Who are you—! Screw off—!”</p>
<p>Aileen’s Spirit Speech pushed Kurukuru away, but it was too late.</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>Orden’s magic power of chaos flickered, and Kim Suho had no choice but to watch the explosion of the Monster King’s ominous magic power.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaa—</em></p>
<p>The overwhelming light from the exploding magic power swallowed the world.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho slowly opened his eyes. A white ceiling filled his eyes. He couldn’t tell where he was, but two familiar faces soon popped up.</p>
<p>It was Chae Nayun and Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“You’re awake?”</p>
<p>“There you go again with your cool-act.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin and Chae Nayun spoke.</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shot up like a spring.</p>
<p>“W-What are you guys doing here!?”</p>
<p>“We can discuss that later. How’s your body?”</p>
<p>“B-Body? I think it’s okay….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho snapped out of his state of shock and looked around his surroundings. In a bunker-like space, several Heroes were lying unconscious.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun answered Kim Suho’s question, “We saved everyone before Orden’s magic power went off, but it looks like just being exposed to it caused mental damage. Everyone else is still unconscious.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin then went on to explain that they were in a bunker created by an 8-star card. Most of the important personnel were summoned here, where the flow of time would help them recover quicker, and the rest were sent to Genkelope's Vessel.</p>
<p>“…What’s happening outside?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked with a dumbfounded face.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t even been 5 minutes yet, so don’t worry. The operation is still underway.”</p>
<p>Heynckes, Chae Joochul, Aileen, Yoo Sihyuk, Yoo Jinwoong, and Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>The above six had survived the explosion and were in the middle of fighting Orden.</p>
<p>“Then I should also—”</p>
<p>“Before that.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin handed Kim Suho a recovery and strength potion.</p>
<p>“Ah, thanks.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho drank the potion without hesitation. Hot liquid coursed through his body. Kim Suho closed his eyes and felt strength returning to his body.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>“How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“…Good.” Kim Suho furrowed his brows as he spoke, “But where did you come from?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“Yes you, Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>“Uh… well, let’s say I was in the middle of training.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin grinned and placed his hand on Kim Suho’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“We can talk about that later. I awakened another Gift while I was training.”</p>
<p>“…Gift? Again?”</p>
<p>“Yep, and this one will be useful when you fight Orden.”</p>
<p>“Me? How would <em>your</em> Gift help <em>me</em>?”</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin displayed a holographic window using his smartwatch.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Constraints and Amplifications] [high-rank]</p>
<p>—Constraints</p>
<p>*Apply temporary ‘constraints’ to the user’s body.</p>
<p>—Amplifications</p>
<p>*Temporarily increase the target’s strength in proportion to the applied ‘constraints’.</p>
<p>—Profitable Exchange</p>
<p>*Increase ‘Amplification’ performance by 77%.</p>
<p>—Side-Effect Alleviation</p>
<p>*The side-effects of this Gift, including the cooldown period, are slightly improved.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I jotted down the effect of my Gift.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho stared at the window in a daze. Strengthened with ‘luck’, Constraints and Amplifications was a buff-type Gift that was high-risk, high-return.</p>
<p>After giving Kim Suho time to read through the Gift, Kim Hajin began his explanation.</p>
<p>“You know how people say ‘yea’ and ‘ya’ have different meanings in Korean? Think about the word ‘target’ here.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s eyes fell on the sentence Kim Hajin pointed to.</p>
<p>「—Amplifications</p>
<p>*Temporarily increase the target’s strength in proportion to the applied ‘constraints’.」</p>
<p>“The constraints are placed on the ‘target’, which doesn’t have to be me necessarily.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho quickly understood what Kim Hajin was implying.</p>
<p>“Amplifications… can be used on you.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin smiled.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave Orden to you.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Sword Saint’s unique ability was something I couldn’t replicate, and I had already used [Time Reversal] as well. So, Kim Suho was the only option left.</p>
<p>I put myself under a week’s worth of constraints. With this, I wouldn’t be able to use myself for a week.</p>
<p>By constraining everything about me, I gave an explosive amplification to Kim Suho. The boost he gained was nothing short of shocking.</p>
<p>Golden magic power, the Authority of the Sword Saint, and Misteltein which now carried the power of wish.</p>
<p>With all these amplified, I was confident that Kim Suho wouldn’t lose to Orden.</p>
<p>—See you later. I’ll be sure to win.</p>
<p>Kim Suho left with those words. Chae Nayun also left with him.</p>
<p>—Wait for me to come back. You and I have a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>After sending Kim Suho and Chae Nayun off, I slowly felt my heart rate slow down. My eyes closed and my breathing became faint.</p>
<p>For a week, I would fall into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>I smirked.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, everything should be over by the time I woke up. Kim Suho would have defeated Orden, and Chae Nayun could potentially learn more from her master, Heynckes.</p>
<p>Sleeping and having the main cast clean up the trouble? Finally, an extra-like story progression.</p>
<p>I did all I could, so I didn’t feel bad.</p>
<p>“…Hajin.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice rang inside my ear.</p>
<p>My mind woke up from the familiar voice.</p>
<p>“…Boss?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me.”</p>
<p>I could hear her voice, but I had long lost my vision.</p>
<p>I raised my hand toward the direction of her voice.</p>
<p>A soft, cold sensation of skin touched me. It was probably Boss’s cheek.</p>
<p>“…It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Where were you all this time? What happened with Bell?”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, I countered Bell. I fought him, won, and escaped.”</p>
<p>“Really? Haha.”</p>
<p>Boss laughed happily at my answer.</p>
<p>I also made a small smile.</p>
<p>“…But Boss.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>A soft sensation touched the back of my head.</p>
<p>I was probably in Boss’s arms. I wanted to enjoy this feeling a little longer, but it probably wouldn’t be long until I fell unconscious.</p>
<p>“Um… I’m too sleepy.”</p>
<p>“I know, you look sleepy.”</p>
<p>“Are Cheok Jungyeong and Jain okay?”</p>
<p>The bunker was too quiet. Since everyone should be asleep, asking about them shouldn’t arouse any suspicion.</p>
<p>“They’re both safe inside the bunker. Ah, well, Cheok Jungyeong left a little while ago, saying he wanted to fight Orden.”</p>
<p>“Then… I’m going to sleep.”</p>
<p>Soon, the rest of my senses began to disappear. I couldn’t move anymore, and my hearing slowly faded away.</p>
<p>“This time, I’ll be asleep for a little longer than usual. About a week. Think of it as a winter hibernation.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Boss’s warm hands stroked my hair.</p>
<p>“Then see you later Boss.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, see you later.”</p>
<p>I relaxed and let myself go. My consciousness scattered away in Boss’s cold yet warm embrace.</p>
<p>But before my consciousness fully disappeared…</p>
<p>“…I wanted to see you.”</p>
<p>Her final words flowed into my ears.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Sky above Africa]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bell came to Africa with his comrade. In truth, he wanted to stay inside his sanctuary until Orden’s death, but his comrade, ‘Yi Yeonjun’, persuaded him otherwise.</p>
<p>“Do you really need to watch in person?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun didn’t bat an eye at Bell’s grumbling.</p>
<p>“Trust me. The Monster King’s corpse will have immense value to us.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was only interested in one thing, Orden’s corpse. Bell didn’t know what he was planning on doing with it… but it was to be expected from the incarnation of avarice that even Baal would be surprised with.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do if you meet Byul?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeongjun lightly brushed off Bell’s worry.</p>
<p>“Then we’ll just meet. Why should I worry about that?”</p>
<p>“…Ehew, fine.”</p>
<p>Bell gave up. He knew what kind of man Yi Yeonjun was. Whether an object or a person, he was the type who wasn’t satisfied until he obtained it. Greedy was a nice way to put it. In truth, it was more like a mental illness.</p>
<p>“Let’s go down, Bell.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>The two men landed on African soil. Orden’s ‘magic power explosion’ had just swept through the land, leaving it clean without any impurities.</p>
<p>“So, Boss, what’s our plan?”</p>
<p>Bell used the title, ‘Boss’, for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun seemed to like it too as he replied with a grin.</p>
<p>“Simple. We’ll wait until Orden dies and snatch his corpse.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 300. Orden</p>
<p>The soil was burning in purple, and the sky was dyed crimson. Pieces of shattered rocks filled the air and the excreted magic power resulted in electric sparks everywhere. The contamination of the atmosphere was so severe that even breathing could be lethal.</p>
<p>This was what Africa looked like after Orden’s magic power explosion.</p>
<p>“…These spears will penetrate your body—!”</p>
<p>Above the devastated field, the fight continued on. Hundreds of spears created from Aileen’s Spirit Speech flew towards Orden. Yoo Jinwoong’s electricity clung to Orden’s entire body.</p>
<p>But Orden dispelled all attacks with a swing of a fist wrapped in magic power. However…</p>
<p>“Turn into a vacuum—!”</p>
<p>Aileen used Spirit Speech again.</p>
<p>She attempted to disrupt Orden’s breathing, flip over the ground he was standing on, and even created a tiny ‘black hole’. The black hole succeeded in sucking in Orden’s cloak but that was about all it did.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chae Joochul drew in the nearby natural energy and created an avatar for himself. It was about 3m tall just like Orden and wore a white martial arts uniform like an immortal.</p>
<p>Orden attacked the avatar. To assist Chae Joochul, Yoo Sihyuk swung his sword and the blade rushed towards Orden like wolves. From a distance, Jin Seyeon continued to shoot crystal arrows.</p>
<p>However, Orden’s response was plain and simple. The ‘chaos’ attribute could easily neutralize human magic power. All he needed was to gather up his magic power and emit it all at once.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>The chaos that Orden emitted disrupted the Heroes’ magic power.</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>And then Orden gave a roar of rage towards the direction of the most troublesome enemy, the archer who kept shooting arrows at him from a hidden spot.</p>
<p>“Uk!”</p>
<p>The supersonic sound waves paralyzed Jin Seyeon’s entire body.</p>
<p>His next target was Aileen. Orden dashed towards Aileen. One step was all he need to reach the dwarf who was not even 150cm tall.</p>
<p>“Stop—”</p>
<p>Orden resisted the Spirit Speech as he swung his claw.</p>
<p>His claw was harder than any metal.</p>
<p>It should’ve ripped Aileen into pieces.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a sword blocked Orden’s claw. On the outside the sword looked like nothing special when in fact, it was was the ‘Steel Spirit Sword’ that embodied Heynckes’s noble determination.</p>
<p>“Move along, little one.”</p>
<p>“…Thanks.”</p>
<p>Though it was humiliating to be called ‘little one’, Aileen moved to shelter with the skill [Blink].</p>
<p><em>Kiiiik—</em></p>
<p>Orden’s claw and Heynckes’s sword crashed into each other and a disturbing sound rang out.</p>
<p>Orden kept his right arm up and smashed Heynckes on the side with his left arm. Heynckes blocked the punch with a new steel sword.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>The clash of steel and the claw continued on.</p>
<p>Heynckes was inferior to Orden in all aspects except for combat experience. The Steel Spirit utilized his experience, skills, and techniques he had accumulated over the years to the fullest. He stirred his sword in between the gaps of Orden’s fingers and left a scar on the Monster King’s chest. He moved swiftly and efficiently, disrupting Orden’s balance.</p>
<p>But he knew he couldn’t maintain this stalemate for long.</p>
<p>‘…He grows as he battles.’</p>
<p>Orden was about to surpass all the skills that Heynckes had accumulated over a span of 60 years in a mere 6 minutes.</p>
<p>Heynckes had to admit— Orden was a real monster.</p>
<p>“You’ve grown old.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Heynckes heard a nonchalant voice. He glanced at the owner of the voice with a smile. Chae Joochul approached Orden with an expressionless look and smacked Orden’s forehead with his folding fan.</p>
<p><em>Chwaak—!</em></p>
<p>The sound was loud but physically it only did a little damage.</p>
<p>Little did Orden know that everything before this attack was just a pretext and that this was the attack the two men had been preparing for all along.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who’s grown old, Joochul. It took you too long.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul’s folding fan was the core of his strength. It served as a medium for the control of all parts of nature.</p>
<p>Thus, when Chae Joochul’s fan touched Orden’s forehead, all of Immortal’s magic power traveled through the fan and flowed into Orden.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Orden buried his head in his hands. Currently, the particles of nature were colliding against each other in his head.</p>
<p>“It should hurt a lot. I’ve experienced it before briefly.”</p>
<p>The cold-blooded Chae Joochul had developed this technique for the sole purpose of ‘annihilation of existence’. It was the worst possible kind of pain. Heynckes, too, had experienced it in the past.</p>
<p>“KUAAAAA—!”</p>
<p>Orden roared in agony. The cry ripped through the Heroes’ ears and disrupted their qi reinforcement. But Heroes weren’t the only ones who responded to Orden’s cry.</p>
<p><em>Tudududu….</em></p>
<p>A huge vibration shook the earth and a fierce whirlwind filled the sky.</p>
<p>The Monster King’s loyal servants had returned from the front lines to the palace to protect their king.</p>
<p>No good could come out of a prolonged battle.</p>
<p>The heroes all rushed towards Orden. Orden, however, blocked them all by emitting a torrent of magic power.</p>
<p>“Y-You b-bastards—!”</p>
<p>“Hurorororo—! Get away from the king!”</p>
<p>But they were overlooking one fact. That Heroes also had reinforcements.</p>
<p>“Hiya—!”</p>
<p>Suddenly a sword appeared that was so big that it almost seemed to touch the sky.</p>
<p>With full confidence, Chae Nayun wielded a giant sword of magic power. The sword gleamed with bright light as it knocked out all of the monsters and humanoid monsters in one big swoop.</p>
<p>And then there was the tornado of the black spear. Shin Jonghak’s ‘black flames’ and ‘Xiang Yu’s Conqueror Spear’ displayed overwhelming synergy.</p>
<p>Yi Yongha’s hellfire devoured the earth, Cheok Jungyeong hailed blows on the humanoid monsters, Nicholas showed off his skill with daggers, and Droon’s Mimyo chomped on the enemies.</p>
<p>…And then.</p>
<p>“Orden—!”</p>
<p>A flash of light raced forward as it emitted golden magic power in all directions.</p>
<p>Kim Suho ran, cutting down every single humanoid monster in his course. His speed far exceeded the maximum capability of a human. He was unstoppable.</p>
<p>“…You!”</p>
<p>Orden emitted magic power from the palms of his hands. The magic power soared like a pillar but Kim Suho easily sliced it in half. Not only Kim Suho, but Heynckes was also pressing the attack on Orden.</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s sword was only seconds away from Orden’s heart.</p>
<p>It was at that moment Orden realized Kim Suho’s weakness.</p>
<p>Kim Suho could only slice magic power that had been emitted externally.</p>
<p>Therefore, all Orden had to do was to contain his magic power inside and directly pour it into Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Just like what Chae Joochul had done to himself…!</p>
<p>Orden refined his magic power and waited for Kim Suho to arrive. A look of firm resolution flashed across Kim Suho’s face.</p>
<p>It appeared he did not have the slightest idea that he was running into the arms of death.</p>
<p>Orden reached out for Kim Suho as the Sword Saint jumped into his arms.</p>
<p>No, he <em>tried</em> to reach out.</p>
<p>Orden was feeling a thousandth of a second.</p>
<p>In the midst of an inflated sense of time, his gaze traveled to the side.</p>
<p>Above the crumbled throne room was the daughter of Park Hanho.</p>
<p>She held in her arms the doll her father had made for her and was looking at Orden with big, round eyes.</p>
<p>Orden knew that the child couldn’t be here, that he had already evacuated her to somewhere safe. This had to be a trap.</p>
<p>…However, despite knowing so, Orden still couldn’t help but hesitate.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Heynckes did not miss the opportunity.</p>
<p><em>Crack.</em></p>
<p>Two swords pierced Orden.</p>
<p>The Sword Saint’s magic power and the Steel Spirit’s aura.</p>
<p>The two giant forces mingled with each other as they penetrated Orden’s heart.</p>
<p>Orden felt an unbearable pain.</p>
<p>At the same time, a question arose in his mind.</p>
<p>‘…Why did I hesitate?’</p>
<p>Orden slowly lowered his head and looked at Kim Suho. His blade was full of unstoppable conviction and determination.</p>
<p>Then he looked at Heynckes. His blade was sharp and cold.</p>
<p>Lastly, he turned his gaze to the child who made him hesitate.</p>
<p>But of course, the child was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Was it an illusion or a trap?</p>
<p>Orden couldn’t tell.</p>
<p><em>Crack—</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t long before Orden felt the Sword Saint’s magic power thrust into his heart.</p>
<p>The magic power destroyed his heart, and the chaos condensed inside it exploded.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaa.</em></p>
<p>The wave of chaos escaped Orden’s body… and spread to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho opened his eyes in the middle of the destruction.</p>
<p>Buildings had crumbled down and concrete debris was everywhere.</p>
<p>At the center of it all was Orden.</p>
<p>He was covered in wounds but still alive. He wasn’t even close to fainting. Orden’s eyes were looking straight at Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“…Are you awake, human child?”</p>
<p>Orden’s voice was slow but clear.</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded in silence. He couldn't even afford to speak out right now. But he had to raise his sword. His fight was not over yet….</p>
<p>“Rest assured, my heart has already been destroyed. I don’t have much time left to live.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Orden began to cure Kim Suho’s wounds. The burning pain enveloping his body quickly dissipated.</p>
<p>Still, Kim Suho looked at Orden with eyes full of distrust. But the look in Orden’s eyes was unwaveringly honest.</p>
<p>“I wanted to find an answer, so I brought you here.”</p>
<p>“…You brought me here?”</p>
<p>It was then a giant insect appeared from behind Orden.</p>
<p>‘Kururu, Kururu….’ He made strange sounds.</p>
<p>It was ‘Kurukuru’.</p>
<p>Orden announced, “I can tell that you are not from this world.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Kim Suho’s heart began to race.</p>
<p>Orden’s eyes were looking directly at the root of Kim Suho’s existence.</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>Orden gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“I tried to devour you to prolong my life, but you destroyed my heart to an irrecoverable state. I couldn’t heal my injuries, but I was able to look into your ‘mirror of memories’. I'm sure of one thing now that I've read your memory.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“You are not a human of this world, and you have died once before.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho neither confirmed nor denied Orden’s claim.</p>
<p>What Orden had said was both true and false at the same time.</p>
<p>Kim Suho had never once considered himself a stranger to this world.</p>
<p>“Which made me wonder. You and I are similar. The only difference between us is that I’m a humanoid monster and you’re a human.”</p>
<p>They were both beings essentially different from everyone else on Earth.</p>
<p>Orden gained intelligence but lost everything else; Kim Suho lost everything but gained a new life.</p>
<p>The two of them were both ‘alone’ at one point in their lives but afterwards diverged onto different paths.</p>
<p>‘Is it because I’m a monster and you’re a human? Is that really the only difference between us?’</p>
<p>Orden needed to know.</p>
<p>“What made you want to live in this world?”</p>
<p>This could be Orden’s last question on Earth.</p>
<p>Feeling the weight of Orden’s curiosity, Kim Suho closed his eyes. He began to ponder in all earnestness the reason he became so attached to this world called ‘Earth’.</p>
<p>The reason Kim Suho was able to betray his country and the king who had taken him in was….</p>
<p>“If I had to say, it’s because of my family at first.”</p>
<p>In Akatrina, Kim Suho had no family.</p>
<p>He was born an orphan and the sword was his only friend.</p>
<p>That was why he was obsessed with sword training.</p>
<p>He found his value in the king and not in himself. His only goal in life was to become a knight to protect the king.</p>
<p>However, things were different here on Earth.</p>
<p>Kim Suho had friends and family who loved and believed in him.</p>
<p>“…Family?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I have a family as well.”</p>
<p>Orden looked at Kim Suho in a daze.</p>
<p>‘What a silly reason,’ he thought.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>As Orden gave a wry smile, he recalled the face of a certain child.</p>
<p>The child was ‘Park Yeonhee’, Park Hanho’s daughter whom Orden had brought back to life.</p>
<p>‘Why did I see her illusion at the most important moment, and why was I so foolishly shaken…?’</p>
<p>At that moment, Orden felt as if his crushed heart had beat.</p>
<p>“That is… such a foolish reason.”</p>
<p>Orden gave a deep sigh.</p>
<p>He realized only now why he felt the emotions he felt, and what he wanted and longed for when he looked at Park Hanho and his daughter and the ways that other humans lived.</p>
<p>The answer was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>He really didn’t need to stray this far to find it.</p>
<p>“At least for me, that was it.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shrugged his shoulders in mild embarrassment.</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>The king smiled.</p>
<p>“They say there isn’t a right answer to life, but if what you’re saying is correct…”</p>
<p>Orden gave a sad yet relieved smile.</p>
<p>He accepted his defeat.</p>
<p>“In the end, all was inevitable.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>‘All was inevitable.’</p>
<p>It was a very irresponsible thing for a murderer of millions of people to say.</p>
<p>Enraged, Kim Suho grabbed Misteltein… but soon put it back down with a sigh.</p>
<p>“What was inevitable?”</p>
<p>Instead, he chose to ask Orden for the ‘answer’ Orden said he found.</p>
<p>Orden muttered in a low voice, “Don’t you know that humanoid monsters cannot make families?”</p>
<p>“Uh…. Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho sunk into silence.</p>
<p>And now, Orden knew that death was his only option.</p>
<p>It made sense to him.</p>
<p>He was the first <em>monster</em> ever to obtain intelligence.</p>
<p>He called himself a ‘humanoid monster’ out of admiration for humans. He combined humans and monsters to create artificial beings. However, an individual was not capable of preserving an entire species.</p>
<p>It was now clear to him that the only way to escape from this pain was death.</p>
<p>“Kururu, Kururu.”</p>
<p>Perhaps Kurukuru realized what the king was thinking.</p>
<p>The servant extended his hand to the king.</p>
<p>It was his front leg full of scars.</p>
<p>“…Kurukuru.”</p>
<p>The king called Kurukuru’s name.</p>
<p>He knew exactly the condition he was in.</p>
<p>His heart had been destroyed, his blood stopped circulating, and the stagnant blood was decaying as his organs shut down one after the other.</p>
<p>Death was just around the corner.</p>
<p>“Kururu….”</p>
<p>Kurukuru flapped his wings. It was his way of expressing disapproval for whatever the king was about to say.</p>
<p>But the king wasn’t worried.</p>
<p>He knew that, given the insect’s loyalty, Kurukuru would never defy his orders.</p>
<p>“Kurukuru, a mantis cannot stop a wagon.”</p>
<p>Orden had read about the story behind this proverb in a book when he first created Kurukuru.</p>
<p>The story was about a foolish and reckless mantis who tried to stop a moving wagon.</p>
<p>Still, Orden was impressed with its boundless courage and hoped his servant would be as loyal and as brave as the mantis from the story.</p>
<p>“Live on.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>This was the king’s last order.</p>
<p>Kurukuru understood even as he trembled in sorrow.</p>
<p>“I have no regrets.”</p>
<p>The king slowly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Kim Suho slowly raised himself.</p>
<p>The servant stared at the king’s lifeless body for a long time. Still there were no tears, simply because insects did not possess the ability to do so physically.</p>
<p>Kurukuru kneeled in front of the king.</p>
<p>And then, he kowtowed.</p>
<p>The tale of the lonely king had finally come to an end.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Africa]</p>
<p>After the colossal explosion that swept the land subsided, Boss deactivated Shadow Armor. She could see the blue sky and the vast grasslands of Africa just beyond the horizon. Orden’s palace had completely been destroyed by none other than Orden himself.</p>
<p>“Boss~”</p>
<p>A childlike voice called Boss from behind. Boss turned around, her long hair fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>Jain, who was disguised as Park Hanho’s daughter, was waving her hand at Boss.</p>
<p>“What’s this? Everything’s over, right~?”</p>
<p>“It seems so. Did your way work?”</p>
<p>“It did, surprisingly~”</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Jain had secretly met up with Rumi who informed her that ‘Orden admires humans’.</p>
<p>Jain couldn’t understand what she meant. So she disguised herself as a humanoid monster and infiltrated into the palace. Only after seeing Orden in person was Jain finally able to draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>“I think he’s into small and cute humans~”</p>
<p>…Unfortunately, her assumption was far from the truth.</p>
<p>“Small and cute humans?”</p>
<p>Boss frowned. She disapproved the implication.</p>
<p>“Yeah~ But Boss, more importantly, how’s Hajin~?”</p>
<p>“He’s in the bunker, so he should be fine.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Then let’s go find Orden’s body~”</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe was fundamentally a group of thieves.</p>
<p>Their goal was, of course, Orden’s body.</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s go.”</p>
<p>The two walked down the street, tracking Orden’s scent.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>The blowing wind carried a particular scent.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Having noticed the scent, Boss froze in place. Her legs wouldn’t move all of a sudden. The same thing happened to Jain.</p>
<p>Boss and Jain exchanged glances with each other, then turned their gaze to the direction that the scent was coming from.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 301. After the War (1)</p>
<p>A familiar scent blew through the air. This scent of magic power was one Boss couldn’t forget.</p>
<p>Boss ran towards the direction of the scent. She knew it wasn’t possible, but she ran and ran anyways. The scent got stronger as she drew closer, and her heart began to thump loudly.</p>
<p>After running crazily for a while, she stopped at a certain point. Jain ran up and stopped next to her. The two women looked forward in a daze.</p>
<p>Standing on top of the crumbled throne room was a certain man. He was sitting calmly on the rubble, seemingly waiting for someone to arrive.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Boss’s eyes widened as she looked at the man. Though he had his back to her, his back seemed too familiar.</p>
<p>Unable to believe what she was seeing, she glanced at Jain. The fact that Jain was standing next to her meant that the man in front of her wasn’t Jain in disguise.</p>
<p>But it all seemed to be an illusion. She questioned whether she was dreaming. That man should have been dead. Was it just someone who looked like him?</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>A gust of wind blew, blowing the man’s hair up. His face was revealed fully, and Boss turned speechless.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>She subconsciously let out a yelp. The man sitting on the rubble also felt her presence.</p>
<p>He tilted his head, then slowly turned around. Boss carefully examined his appearance. As the man’s hair blew in the air, his well-defined facial features came into full view.</p>
<p>The ex-boss of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>It was the face of Yi Yeonjun, the man she saw as her father.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…My body sunk into a bottomless ocean. I could neither open my eyes nor breathe. But I was used to such pain. As long as I endured it, I knew this illusion would soon disappear.</p>
<p>“…Chae Nayun.”</p>
<p>A voice seeped in through the surface of the water. The reverberating sound took the form of a devil and swallowed me. The devil wore my mother’s face and then my brother’s face before entering my heart as despair and sorrow.</p>
<p>“…Chae Nayun!”</p>
<p>A sharp voice scratched my heart. I was stifled for breath like someone was strangling me. The faces of the people I love but could no longer see appeared before my closed eyes.</p>
<p>My cold heart trembled.</p>
<p>Why do I have to be the only one to feel such pain? Why do I have to always send off the people I love?</p>
<p><em>Chak!</em></p>
<p>A fiery pain awoke Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“…Hu!”</p>
<p>Her eyes shot open as she let out a cough. Shin Jonghak and Yun Seung-Ah’s faces were right in front of her.</p>
<p>“Uwuaaak!”</p>
<p>“Woah!”</p>
<p>“Kyak—!’</p>
<p>Chae Nayun screamed in surprise, making Shin Jonghak and Yun Seung-Ah also screech. Chae Nayun pushed the two away and shot up.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa, haa….”</p>
<p>She clutched her chest and took several deep breaths.</p>
<p>“Geez… huu.”</p>
<p>Perhaps because Orden’s magic power had swept through her, the nightmare was worse than usual.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Yun Seung-Ah approached her and patted her on the back.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun nodded her head and asked, “…I’m okay. What’s the situation?”</p>
<p>“It’s mostly taken care of.” Shin Jonghak replied. He looked around his surroundings with the Conqueror Spear resting on his shoulder. “Orden’s magic power disappeared without a trace, and the Master-rank Heroes took care of the humanoid monsters with the Genkelope Vessel’s help.”</p>
<p>“…So everything’s over?”</p>
<p>“No,” Yun Seung-Ah answered. “There are still many humanoid monster villages in Africa and even more brainwashed people. We’re just getting started.”</p>
<p>“Ah…” Chae Nayun scratched the back of her neck and looked around. Orden’s palace had crumbled down completely, revealing Africa’s vast wilderness. Heroes were sitting or lying on the ground, while agents from the Genkelope Vessel were quickly moving about, rescuing and treating injured Heroes.</p>
<p>“…Ah, where’s Old Man Heynckes?”</p>
<p>She suddenly remembered Heynckes, who was at the heart of the magic power explosion.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah’s expression turned grim. Chae Nayun’s heart sank simultaneously.</p>
<p>“W-What? What happened?”</p>
<p>“Well….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah pointed to her right without a full explanation.</p>
<p>In the middle of the wilderness where her finger was pointing to was a man who was frozen like a statue.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s heart dropped.</p>
<p>The man’s silver armor shone beautifully.</p>
<p>It was the end of the Star that had turned fully into steel…</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>She didn’t have time to think. She quickly ran over to Heynckes, but she simply stood there, staring dumbfoundedly at his silver helmet.</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>She touched the helmet and muttered quietly. Her voice trembled with sadness.</p>
<p>“This is a lie… right, Old Man?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was choked with tears in front of reality. A reality that was hard to believe. The days she spent on the cold Himalayan mountain exchanging swords with him flashed before her eyes.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>“I told you not to call me Old Man—!”</p>
<p>“Aaak, jesus!”</p>
<p>The helmet came off with Heynckes’s shout. The startled Chae Nayun fell backward on her butt.</p>
<p>“Uhahahaha, that was fun.”</p>
<p>“A-Ah, my heart… Old Man, you…!”</p>
<p>“Why am I your old man? Your old man just left after treating you.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s eyes widened at what Heynckes just said.</p>
<p>“Eh? Grandfather did?”</p>
<p>“Yep. Well, that was 30 minutes ago, but don’t be too harsh on him. Joochul is a busy man.”</p>
<p>“…Grandfather’s always been like that.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun nodded without complaints.</p>
<p>“But what about you, Old Man? Are you feeling okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but I seem fine for now.” Heynckes replied.</p>
<p>At that moment, Kim Suho appeared from the distance. A Genkelope agent was helping him walk, as he was clearly exhausted and out of energy.</p>
<p>“Oh, here comes the Sword Saint.”</p>
<p>“Kim Suho~!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s party, including Heynckes and Yun Seung-Ah, ran over to him. Seeing that his friends were okay, Kim Suho smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see you guys again.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but rather than that—"</p>
<p>“Did Orden die?” Heynckes cut off Chae Nayun and asked. His expression was more serious than what Chae Nayun had ever seen before.</p>
<p>“…Yes, Orden is dead.” Kim Suho nodded. He had witnessed Orden’s death. Orden closed his eyes at peace and passed normally.</p>
<p>Heynckes asked again, “Did you confirm his corpse?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Kim Suho nodded. “It scattered to dust.”</p>
<p>“…Dust? It turned to dust?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled without answering him. Orden’s corpse was taken by Kurukuru. The king’s servant would surely take care so that no one would ever find it.</p>
<p>“Yes, it turned to dust.”</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Heynckes’s Steel Eyes could discern truth from lies. However, he simply wore a gentle smile and tapped Kim Suho’s shoulders.</p>
<p>“Well done, as expected of a Nine Stars candidate.”</p>
<p>“…You overestimate me.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Nine Stars candidate?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s jealous interjection made everyone laugh.</p>
<p><em>Tiriring— Tiriring—!</em></p>
<p>“Ah, geez.”</p>
<p>It was then that an emergency alarm rang from the Heroes’ smartwatches. Every Hero present looked down at their wrists.</p>
<p>[Disaster Alert. At 3:13 p.m., a large group of humanoid monsters and monsters invaded England.]</p>
<p>“…It’s England this time?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun frowned. But Yun Seung-Ah, who was staring at the message closely, shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, this is from earlier in the day. We must have gotten it late because of Orden’s signal interference.”</p>
<p>In other words, the message was from when they were in the middle of their operation. Yun Seung-Ah’s conjecture was quickly proven to be correct, as a follow-up message arrived.</p>
<p>[Update on England’s Disaster Alert. The situation has been taken care of with the help of Princess Rachel and the 9-star magician Ah Hae-In.]</p>
<p>“9-star Ah Hae-In and Rachel…”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun shrugged. She didn’t know what happened exactly, but…</p>
<p>“Easy fight, I guess.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Five days after the Orden Annihilation Operation, treatment of humanoid monsters rose as a major issue across the world along with Orden’s African villages.</p>
<p>—I recently got a strange request.</p>
<p>Because of it, Yoo Yeonha was busy to the point she had little time to sleep, but she made time for Yoo Jinhyuk’s call.</p>
<p>“Request?”</p>
<p>—Yep. If possible, I want to take care of it alone, but you know how busy I am. So I thought I’d ask for help from my beloved niece, haha.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinhyuk, who had never contacted her first for more than 20 years, was asking her for help. More than anything, Yoo Yeonha was curious.</p>
<p>“What’s the request?”</p>
<p>—Looking into someone. It sounds simple, but we can’t look down on it.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinhyuk sent a file over the call.</p>
<p>The file contained a picture of the target and his personal information.</p>
<p>「Yi Yeongjun (real name unknown)」</p>
<p>「183cm 77kg」</p>
<p>「Male」</p>
<p>「Birthdate unknown」</p>
<p>「Ability unknown」</p>
<p>「Place of birth unknown」</p>
<p>「Family relations are unknown」</p>
<p>“…Yi Yeonjun? Everything’s pretty much unknown, huh?”</p>
<p>—Yep, we don’t even know if his name is real. But he’s a dangerous one for sure. He’s the founder of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha flinched.</p>
<p>“The Chameleon Troupe?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. About a month or two ago, I got a request asking to investigate Yi Yeonjun’s past. I put it off at the time, but the client keeps upping the price.”</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha rubbed her chin and sighed.</p>
<p>“Won’t it be too dangerous?”</p>
<p>—I’m the one in charge of the investigation, so I’ll be the only one in danger. You just have to look into his past whereabouts.</p>
<p>“…Past whereabouts?”</p>
<p>—Yep.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinhyuk nodded his head with a smile.</p>
<p>—Find out where he was a few years ago. In other words, I want you to narrow down the range of the past I need to experience.</p>
<p>“Hm… your Gift is still lively, huh?”</p>
<p>—I’ve saved it for times like this. The pay for this request is the highest I’ve seen in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha glanced at the price offered by the client and almost choked in shock.</p>
<p>7.7 billion up-front.</p>
<p>22.3 billion after completion.</p>
<p>30 billion won was enough to make the request hard to refuse, but the client had even offered two pinnacle-grade artifacts. Just who was this rich maniac?</p>
<p>—So? Want to help? I’ll let you have 20%.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha fell in thought but quickly came to a conclusion. Investigating the Chameleon Troupe was something like a duty she had to fulfill.</p>
<p>‘Yoo Jinwoong and Chae Joochul. Chae Joochul and the Chameleon Troupe. The Chameleon Troupe and Kim Hajin. Kim Hajin and me.’</p>
<p>She knew that the Chameleon Troupe was the key to unraveling this complicated problem.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll help.”</p>
<p>As soon as she replied, a bell rang in her head.</p>
<p>It was the sixth sense Unique Skill. Because of its low level, she didn’t know whether it was signaling danger or opportunity, but she knew it was an important matter at the very least.</p>
<p>—Perfect. Do you know what to do?</p>
<p>“…Of course. If he used the internet even once, I can track him down.”</p>
<p>In the Falling Blossom guild, a man named Kim Hosup had risen to the number 1 position in tracking. In the current digital age, there wasn’t anyone who lived without using the internet.</p>
<p>Now linked with a supercomputer worth billions of won, Kim Hosup could find anyone who was born after the 1980s.</p>
<p>—Great, then I’ll wait for the good news. Be careful.</p>
<p>“Okay, talk to you later. I have a meeting to go to now.”</p>
<p>—Ah, wait, how is the guild business going recently?</p>
<p>“…Guild business? Pft.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha laughed. With the recent Orden Incident, Essence of the Strait had risen to the undisputed number 1 position in the world.</p>
<p>Although Creator’s Sacred Grace skyrocketed to the rank 2 position with the help of Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah, the gap between the two was still huge. Essence of the Strait had also made great achievements, thanks to Guild Leader Yoo Jinwoong, Vice-Leader Yi Jin-Ah, and the rising star Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>The guild aside, Essence of the Strait’s subsidiary businesses were simply insurmountable.</p>
<p>Essential Pharmacy, Essential Dynamics, and the other conglomerate-scale businesses were on the precipice of record high revenues in their fields.</p>
<p>“It’s going great. At this rate, people might start calling me the Queen of Korea instead of the Queen of Seoul.”</p>
<p>—Ooh… Well, that’s great to hear. Looks like I can live off my niece when I grow old.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinhyuk laughed lightly.</p>
<p>—Then see you later.</p>
<p>“Yes, see you later, Uncle.”</p>
<p><em>Tk—</em></p>
<p>“Let’s see… Falling Blossom Team, answer.”</p>
<p>As soon as the caller hung up, Yoo Yeonha relayed the mission to Falling Blossom.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…You completed the third phase with high contributions. A streak of Stigma is added. Proficiency of Master Sharpshooter increases. You gain a significant amount of SP. Young Dwarf’s Dexterity…</p>
<p>Several sentences entered my faint consciousness. It wasn’t just the sentences. Chae Nayun’s voice struck my ear as well.</p>
<p>[Kim Hajin, are you awake?]</p>
<p>[You didn’t run away again, did you?]</p>
<p>[I heard from Old Man Heynckes. I heard you’re going to get stabbed my his knife if you don’t reply to me.]</p>
<p>[Message me when you wake up.]</p>
<p>From the looks of it, humanity seemed to have won the war.</p>
<p>I tried to send Chae Nayun a message.</p>
<p>[I’m up.]</p>
<p>The constraints on me were starting to loosen. Although I couldn’t move my body yet, I could reply to Chae Nayun’s Infinite Communication.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>But Chae Nayun didn’t reply no matter how long I waited. It seemed she was busy with something.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I put strength into my eyes. I needed to see before I could do anything.</p>
<p>“…Huu!”</p>
<p>Thankfully, it didn’t take long for me to open my eyes. A white ceiling filled my vision.</p>
<p><em>Ssk— Ssk—</em></p>
<p>Next, I focused my strength on my fingers and toes. It was a bit harder this time around, but I eventually regained control of my body after about 10 minutes of struggling.</p>
<p>“Ehew….”</p>
<p>This was enough for now.</p>
<p>I let out a sigh and turned my head to the side where I was hearing the ruffling of paper for a while.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>I was faced with an unexpected scene. Jin Sahyuk was lying on a couch, reading a manhwa.</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, you’re awake.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spoke with her eyes still fixed on the manhwa. I stared at her blankly.</p>
<p>“…Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p><em>Tak—</em></p>
<p>She closed the manhwa. She stared back at me, then muttered something I couldn’t quite understand.</p>
<p>“I’m protecting you from certain danger.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 302. After the War (2)</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spoke words I couldn’t understand. But it didn’t seem like she was joking. To be honest, we weren’t exactly close enough to be exchanging jokes.</p>
<p>So I simply asked back.</p>
<p>“…You’re protecting me?”</p>
<p>“Yep, you heard right.”</p>
<p>She even put the manhwa down and looked at me seriously.</p>
<p>“…I need more details.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shrugged.</p>
<p>“I don’t know much either. It was an order from Bell.”</p>
<p>“Bell?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He said Yi Yeonjun was planning to kill you. I know you’re not the type to go down easily, but people that Bell warn me about are usually strong.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>‘Is it because I’m still drowsy? I feel like I just heard something crazy….’</p>
<p>I looked at Jin Sahyuk with a frown.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shook her head.</p>
<p>“I already told you, I don’t know much. I just took you out of the bunker because Bell said it was dangerous for you to be around the Chameleon Troupe right now. So, I saved you, in a sense.”</p>
<p>“…Wait, did you just say Yi Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>I knew who ‘Yi Yeonjun’ was.</p>
<p>He was the former leader of the Chameleon Troupe who died as a result of Bell’s betrayal.</p>
<p>According to Boss, at least.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t he dead?”</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stroked her chin as she tried to sort her thoughts.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details, but… I heard he came back to life.”</p>
<p>“How’s that possible?”</p>
<p>“How would I know? More importantly,” Jin Sahyuk placed her index finger on my chest and said, “It’s your turn to speak.”</p>
<p>“Speak about what?”</p>
<p>“You said Bell confessed to you.”</p>
<p>“Confessed? What the hell are you….”</p>
<p>Then I remembered. Bell had informed me that he was Baal’s incarnation body and that I’d have to kill him in order to reach a happy ending.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk brushed her hair off her face and looked at me.</p>
<p>“…Bell said he told you all his secrets.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so that’s what you meant. Well….”</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders and told Jin Sahyuk everything I heard from Bell.</p>
<p>Her expression became more and more serious as I continued to talk. She even started to bite her fingernails when I told her that Bell was Baal’s incarnation body.</p>
<p>“…That’s all I heard from Bell.”</p>
<p>I finished talking and turned on my smartwatch. There were lots of messages from lots of different people, including Kim Suho and Evandel. But the name that caught my attention immediately was ‘Boss’.</p>
<p>[Hajin whre are you?]</p>
<p>[Where are you?]</p>
<p>[I have someone I’d like you to meet. Where did you go?]</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry, I’m on the Genkelope’s Vessel.’ I wrote back and got up from the bed. Then I took a quick tour around the place.</p>
<p>The gray walls were neat and the kitchen and the bathroom were clean. I could see the whole of the East Sea beyond the windows.</p>
<p>It was late at night and the ocean waves were dancing in the darkness. For me, it felt as if the ‘final arc’ that I didn’t know about was lurking in the very same darkness.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk came up to me. She, too, turned her gaze to the sea.</p>
<p>I asked Jin Sahyuk, “Do you still think I’m Kindspring?”</p>
<p>I smiled wryly at the thought of the misunderstanding. Sorting it out with Jin Sahyuk would most likely cost me a lot. Bringing up Kindspring just now raised ‘Synchronization’ by 0.3%.</p>
<p>[Current Synchronization — 13%]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned her head to look at me. She didn’t seem too upset now— perhaps Kim Chundong’s emotions had affected her as well.</p>
<p>She looked at me in the eyes and gave a small laugh.</p>
<p>“…Not anymore. But I’m sure you have something to do with Kindspring.”</p>
<p>I smiled. It was a silent affirmation.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk announced, “I’ll be by your side until I figure out your relationship with Kindspring.”</p>
<p>“…That’s also an order from Bell, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. So just tell me one thing every month,” Saying so, Jin Sahyuk turned her gaze to the sea. I did so as well. Things I still didn’t know were dancing in the shadows.</p>
<p>It was then something suddenly crossed my mind.</p>
<p>I asked carefully, “…Do you still plan to return to your homeland?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Jin Sahyuk nodded without a hint of hesitation.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because people are waiting for me there.”</p>
<p>“Akatrina has already fallen.”</p>
<p>“No, you never know. Akatrina is stronger than you think.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>As the original author, I knew that Akatrina had fallen for good. Not to mention, 30 years had passed after Jin Sahyuk’s death. Akatrina wouldn’t have been able to survive for that long.</p>
<p>“What if Akatrina doesn’t exist? Are you still going to go back?” I asked coldly. I was feeling somewhat sympathetic towards the king who hoped for something impossible.</p>
<p>“…It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>I thought Jin Sahyuk might get mad.</p>
<p>But instead, she shook her head calmly.</p>
<p>“Without Akatrina, I have no reason left to live.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She carried the most resolute determination in the world. Though Jin Sahyuk lost many things, she still held onto this hope.</p>
<p>“I’ll gladly meet my death in my homeland.”</p>
<p>‘Akatrina’ meant everything to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>[Someone inside you responded to the king’s conviction.]</p>
<p>[Synchronization has increased by 2%.]</p>
<p>[Current Synchronization — 15%]</p>
<p>[Warning! Be careful not to lose yourself.]</p>
<p>It seemed that Kim Chundong’s loyalty towards Jin Sahyuk was also genuine.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I turned away from Jin Sahyuk. To distract myself, I called Spartan. Spartan appeared out of the void and landed on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>I ignored Jin Sahyuk’s question and turned my attention to my smartwatch.</p>
<p>[Hajin, I miss you ㅠ-ㅠ]</p>
<p>[I’m bored~]</p>
<p>[This is the spirit beast I made today~ Cute kitty~ Do you like it?]</p>
<p>[ㅠㅠ Why won’t you reply?]</p>
<p>[I miss you]</p>
<p>[ㅠㅠ]</p>
<p>All these were messages were from Evandel. I couldn’t answer because I had been unconscious.</p>
<p>They were enough to make me forget about Synchronization.</p>
<p>“…Spartan?”</p>
<p>—Piek?</p>
<p>“Let’s go see Evandel.”</p>
<p>—Prrr.</p>
<p>“What? Where do you think you’re going-”</p>
<p>With a nod, Spartan immediately activated Teleportation.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>We arrived at a dense forest filled with the energy of spirit beasts. This forest belonged to Evandel.</p>
<p>Most humans could never enter this natural fortress because of the magic power filled up inside their bodies. But I could, thanks to my [Magic Dysfunction Physique] and the [Black Lotus Uniform].</p>
<p>I walked towards Evandel’s cabin with Spartan on my shoulder.</p>
<p>My Gift, [Master Sharpshooter], which had leveled up to grade-1, allowed me to comprehend the structure of the forest and Evandel’s location the moment I set foot inside it.</p>
<p>[♥ Evandel’s Cabin ^-^ ★]</p>
<p>Soon, I arrived at a cabin with a cute door plate.</p>
<p>With a smile of satisfaction, I knocked on the door.</p>
<p>I heard a noise inside.</p>
<p>Not being able to wait any longer, I peeked through the door. Evandel was rubbing her eyes in bed. It seemed she just woke up.</p>
<p>“Evandel, it’s me.”</p>
<p>I whispered in front of the door. Immediately, Evandel’s eyes widened. She got out of bed in a hurry and bolted to the door to open it.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Her eyes became even bigger when she saw me.</p>
<p>“How have you been?”</p>
<p>“…Aaaang!”</p>
<p>Having been left alone for months, Evandel jumped into my arms with tears in her eyes. The way she called my name repeatedly—‘Hajin~ Hajiiin~’—made me tear up a little as well.</p>
<p>I hugged Evandel and patted her head.</p>
<p>…It was most definitely a touching reunion.</p>
<p>For the next 4 hours, I looked around the cabin with Evandel, went outside to play with Evandel and her spirit beasts, had Evandel introduce all of her spirit beasts to me one by one, and then returned to the cabin.</p>
<p>“Do you want to meet Rachel now?”</p>
<p>“Rachel?!”</p>
<p>Evandel squealed in joy.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we can’t meet her in person. We’ll just call her.”</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>At first, she seemed a little disappointed, but soon a smile appeared on her face.</p>
<p>For a more vivid experience, I opened an app called [Hologram]. I then sent Rachel a text asking her to give me a video call.</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
<p>Soon, my smartwatch rang, and I immediately picked up Rachel’s call.</p>
<p>[Entering Hologram Chatroom]</p>
<p>A hologram of Rachel appeared in front of us. It was so realistic that I felt as if Rachel was there in person.</p>
<p>“Hi.”</p>
<p>—What’s going on? How did you get in there, Hajin-ssi?</p>
<p>“I have my ways.”</p>
<p>“Rachel~”</p>
<p>Evandel spread her arms out and went up to Rachel. She was going for a hug, but because Rachel was just a hologram, Evandel passed right through Rachel’s body.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>—…Hold on a little longer, Evandel. We’ll see each other again soon.</p>
<p>Rachel gave a gentle smile. Evandel nodded.</p>
<p>But the heartwarming atmosphere did not last for long.</p>
<p><em>Beep— Beep—</em> Suddenly, a number of messages popped up in the air accompanied by the sound of alarms.</p>
<p>[Administrator is entering the chatroom through admin permission.]</p>
<p>[Code:1231]</p>
<p>Administrator’s interference.</p>
<p>Immediately, a different hologram appeared in the cabin.</p>
<p>—Hm. So it was you two, after all.</p>
<p>“…What the.”</p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat from surprise.</p>
<p>The administrator who hijacked our chatroom was none other than ‘Yoo Yeonha’.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked at Evandel, then Rachel, then me before smiling.</p>
<p>—She’s that child?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha pointed at Evandel.</p>
<p>“H-Huh? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>I quickly hid Evandel behind me, but Yoo Yeonha frowned like a demon.</p>
<p>—I already heard everything from Rachel.</p>
<p>“What?” I turned to Rachel.</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, Rachel nodded.</p>
<p>—She’s right, though it was more like we got caught. But she promised to become Evandel’s patron. I left you a text because you didn’t answer the phone… I guess you didn’t see it.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha grinned and held out her hand to Evandel all of a sudden.</p>
<p>—Hi. It’s nice to meet you.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, hello….”</p>
<p>Though a bit shy, Evandel responded courteously.</p>
<p>—Hmmn…. Cute girl.</p>
<p>“How did you even manage to come into this room?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha folded her arms in a pompous manner.</p>
<p>—My company made this app. More importantly….</p>
<p><em>Tadadak—</em> Yoo Yeonha started typing on a keyboard. She was trying to send a private message to me.</p>
<p>[You’re the one who asked Yoo Jinhyuk to investigate Yi Yeonjun, right?]</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>I flinched, then threw a quick glance at Yoo Yeonha. She seemed convinced that it was me.</p>
<p>I really couldn’t get anything past Yoo Yeonha. At this point, I knew she wouldn’t believe me even if I said it wasn’t me.</p>
<p>“Kuhum”</p>
<p>I let out a dry cough and nodded slightly.</p>
<p>[I knew it. We’re putting our all into the Yi Yeonjin investigation right now. The whole thing does seem a little shady, but why are you looking for a dead man?]</p>
<p>So she already figured out Yi Yeonjun is officially dead.</p>
<p>Impressed, I sent Yoo Yeonha a private message.</p>
<p>[Rumor has it that he’s alive.]</p>
<p>—Pardon?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha frowned further.</p>
<p>[Oh, then maybe….]</p>
<p>She didn’t finish her sentence, but I knew she was asking about the Kwang-Oh Incident.</p>
<p>[Yeah, Yi Yeonjin was the leader of the Chameleon Troupe during the Kwang-Oh Incident. Back then, the Chameleon Troupe was more cruel and inhumane than now.]</p>
<p>[…I see.]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha made a somewhat sad expression.</p>
<p>[I get why you’d want to catch him.]</p>
<p><em>Tadadak—</em></p>
<p>Her typing continued.</p>
<p>[…I get it but don’t do it alone. I know how much you resent the Chameleon Troupe, but… promise me you’ll work with me this time.]</p>
<p>Regret, sadness, determination, resolve… all those emotions were embedded in Yoo Yeonha’s expression.</p>
<p>[Okay. I’ll count on you, then.]</p>
<p>I replied with a faint smile.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Rachel, who had been left out all along, suddenly narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>—…What are you two doing?</p>
<p>—…Doesn’t concern you. It’s something important.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha waved her hand at Rachel as if shooing away a fly. Rachel closed her mouth in embarrassment. Determined to take revenge, she then tweaked a few settings, shrinking the size of Yoo Yeonha’s hologram.</p>
<p>—What the. What are you doing? Can’t you tell that I’m in the middle of a conversation?</p>
<p>—No, I’m the one who was in a call with Hajin-ssi. You’re the intruder, Yeonha-ssi.</p>
<p>—What? Are you kidding me?! …Wha-</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yoo Yeonha’s voice became high pitched. Rachel had not only altered Yoo Yeonha’s size but also her voice….</p>
<p>—What do you think you’re doing? Change me back! We didn’t make this feature so that you could do something like this!</p>
<p>—Haha. You’re cute when you’re small, Yeonha-ssi. Would you like bunny ears as well…?</p>
<p>Rachel tapped on the screen a couple of times. Yoo Yeonha’s nose became red and a pair of bunny ears popped up on her head.</p>
<p>—Hey! Are you crazy?!</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was not the type to let things slide. She used administrator privileges to make Rachel smaller than Evandel.</p>
<p>—Ah. What is this? Change me back!</p>
<p>—You started it.</p>
<p>—Stop being childish.</p>
<p>—You’re the one to talk.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha and Rachel, both 130cm tall, glared at each other.</p>
<p>Evandel watched them as if she was watching a play. I called Spartan.</p>
<p>“Spartan?”</p>
<p>—Prrr.</p>
<p>Words weren’t necessary between me and Spartan.</p>
<p>Spartan could read my mind and always did what I needed him to do.</p>
<p>“Nothing’s wrong with the invisibility cloak, right?”</p>
<p>—Prrr.</p>
<p>“Good. Be careful, and if you get caught, return immediately.”</p>
<p>I asked Spartan to monitor Yi Yeonjun and Boss. I wanted to see what Yi Yeonjun was up to and protect Boss.</p>
<p>—Kiaaao!</p>
<p>Spartan flapped his wings and disappeared into the sky.</p>
<p>—Just because the media is calling you the Elemental Swordsman, you’re holding your head too high….</p>
<p>—Don’t you know that it’s a crime to use company admin rights to spy on a private chatroom…</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rachel and Yoo Yeonha were still arguing with each other. They were yelling and pointing fingers at each other, but I couldn’t understand half the things they were saying because of the voice alteration.</p>
<p>It looked like it would take a while for them to settle down….</p>
<p>“Evandel, do you wanna go outside and play?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>Evandel grinned.</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s go.”</p>
<p>I let the two holograms quarrel and left the cabin with Evandel.</p>
<p>Outside the cabin was the forest full of Evandel’s spirit beasts.</p>
<p>The view was straight out of a fairy tale. The unicorn was flying in the sky, the cat and the squirrel were racing against each other, and the hare and the tortoise were scratching each other’s backs.</p>
<p>All was peaceful and heartwarming.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Pandemonium, Chameleon Troupe’s Hideout]</p>
<p>At the rooftop of the Chameleon Troupe’s hideout, Yi Yeonjin was looking down at Pandemonium, the city that once belonged to the Chameleon Troupe. His eyes were dark but full of greed that could devour Pandemonium whole.</p>
<p>“…You did well, Byul. I’m proud of you.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun patted Yi Byul who was standing beside him on the shoulder. Yi Byul looked at Yi Yeonjun with eyes full of confusion.</p>
<p>She had always believed that he was dead.</p>
<p>After she killed her own parents, Yi Yeonjun had taken on the role of her father. The fact that he had returned alive was something she couldn’t accept so easily.</p>
<p>“Um… Boss.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re the boss, Byul. Don’t call me that.”</p>
<p>But his voice, scent, the way he talked, and even his magic power were the same as before.</p>
<p>“I’m no longer a member of the Chameleon Troupe. The Chameleon Troupe belongs to you, and I don’t plan to take it away from you,” Yi Yeonjun said.</p>
<p>He looked at Yi Byul. Yi Byul looked up at him from below.</p>
<p>“…But you see, the Seat of Black that you took in… Kim Hajin, was it?”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Yi Yeonjun said something totally unexpected.</p>
<p>“He’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a surprise that you didn’t know, Byul. He teamed up with Bell. The same Bell who murdered me.”</p>
<p>A voice flowed into Yi Yeonjun’s ears as he spoke.</p>
<p>—You’re selling my name already?</p>
<p>It was a Mental Transmission from Bell.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun answered with a straight face.</p>
<p>—Byul thinks you’re the enemy. So if I can use you to turn her against him, then I will. You need to understand.</p>
<p>—…Hmm. It’s just that, I’m not sure it’ll work~</p>
<p>As Bell expected, Yi Byul quickly shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, you’re wrong. Hajin would never do that.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun stared at her and gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“Really? I hope so. …Mm, I should go back now.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? To where?”</p>
<p>“My body isn’t completely recovered yet. Don’t worry, I’m not mad at you.”</p>
<p>“…But Boss, I mean… Wait.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun tried to leave, citing his health as the reason, and Boss chased after him worriedly.</p>
<p>—See? I told you, Kim Hajin ruined Byul. She’s completely different now. If you want to get rid of him, you’ll have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>Another Mental Transmission flowed into his ears. Bell sounded cheerful as he made fun of his friend’s failure.</p>
<p>With a nonchalant expression, Yi Yeonjin kept his silence.</p>
<p>…Meanwhile, hidden in the deep darkness, a bird was watching them.</p>
<p>“Prrr—”</p>
<p>Spartan delivered not only the conversation between Yi Yeonjun and Boss but also the Mental Transmission Yi Yeonjun was receiving.</p>
<p>‘Yeah, I’m listening. Go after them, but come back if it looks like you’ll get caught.’</p>
<p>A reply from Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Masked by the shadows of the night, Spartan chased Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 303. After the War (3)</p>
<p>I woke up on a small bed in Evandel’s cabin. The temperature inside was pleasant, and my arm was serving as Evandel’s pillow. I could hear her breathing calmly in her sleep.</p>
<p>Looking at her, all sorts of emotions swept through me: pride, gratitude, sadness… Although she wasn’t my real daughter, I likely saw her as one.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>I felt sorry and ashamed, and this feeling would only grow stronger in the future.</p>
<p>A long time had passed since I came to this world. The farewell that seemed so far away was ever closer. Soon, once the final arc ended, I would most likely be sent back to Earth, and this world would go on without me.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I looked at Evandel, who was sleeping soundly. Morning light shone through the window and gently caressed her face.</p>
<p>Looking at her, an unknown feeling began to rise in my heart.</p>
<p>‘I don’t want to leave.’</p>
<p>That thought surfaced in my head for the first time.</p>
<p>Just like the song I once heard in the other world… I was more afraid of not being by their side than them not being my side.</p>
<p>“…Ehew.”</p>
<p>A sigh left my mouth. By the looks of it, I was done sleeping for the day.</p>
<p>I picked up the smartwatch I placed on the drawer next to the bed. Then, I began to look through the social media accounts of Heroes who participated in the Orden mission.</p>
<p>***</p>

<p>Next was Chae Nayun’s page. She posted a picture of two greatswords she recently bought.</p>

<p>I widened my eyes the moment I saw them. My Gift, [Observation and Reading], activated.</p>
<p>[Unknown Artifact Greatsword] [???] [???]</p>
<p>[Crusader’s Zweihander]</p>
<p>I didn’t know which sword Chae Nayun used as her main weapon. But even [Observation and Reading] couldn’t see through [Unknown Artifact Greatsword]. It meant it was a high-rank artifact at the very least.</p>
<p>If she bought it, she got lucky. If Essence of the Strait lent it to her, they probably didn’t know its true value.</p>

<p>[♡14,003,112]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Temple of Justice, Essence of the Strait, Yun Seung-Ah, Creator’s Sacred Grace, Shin Jonghak… I looked through social media posts for about 20 minutes before carefully leaving the bed.</p>
<p>I walked up to the window of the cabin, then received the memories Spartan transmitted.</p>
<p>The conversation between Boss and Yi Yeonjun and the secret message between Yi Yeonjun and Bell replayed in my head.</p>
<p>“…Yi Yeonjun.” I muttered calmly.</p>
<p>He was currently the most mysterious character. I didn’t know anything about his motive, but I knew that he wanted to kill me.</p>
<p>“Bell, you bastard….”</p>
<p>I understood why Jin Sahyuk cursed at Bell 24/7. Bell had known about Yi Yeonjun, and he had hidden Yi Yeonjun’s existence on purpose.</p>
<p>“Hm…”</p>
<p>A bitter taste remained in my mouth. The best way to avoid being killed by Yi Yeonjun was undeniably to kill him first. But that would make Boss sad. She might even hate me for it. I knew how much she longed for Yi Yeonjun from the rare instances she talked about him.</p>
<p>So I didn’t want to kill him. It wasn’t that I couldn’t. I just didn’t want to. I was tired of being hated.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>While I was standing deep in thought, messages suddenly popped up in front of me. They looked just like the ones I received from the co-author.</p>
<p>[★Announcement★ The final phase is starting soon.]</p>
<p>[The temporarily stopped Demon Realm Transformation has resumed.]</p>
<p>[As the original author, you may view a map of the regions undergoing Demon Realm Transformation.]</p>
<p>[It is recommended that you visit these sites.]</p>
<p>[Do not forget. You have the right to ask me a question.]</p>
<p>“…Yeah, thanks.”</p>
<p>The co-author didn’t even make me mad anymore. His messages just passed through me like water. After all, getting mad wouldn’t change anything.</p>
<p>But the fact that this was the ‘final’ phase made me a bit sad.</p>
<p>“Mmnn….”</p>
<p>Evandel tossed and turned on the bed. She was pulling on the blanket as if to find me.</p>
<p>With a grin, I turned on the smartwatch and messaged Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>[Hey, let’s meet in two days.]</p>
<p>Her reply came quickly.</p>
<p>[Two days later?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, there’s something I need to tell you about the Demon Realm Transformation.]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s guild and businesses had to stand in the forefront of humanity’s battle against the Demon Realm Transformation.</p>
<p>In the next moment, I got curious about something else.</p>
<p>[By the way, are the two swords Chae Nayun uploaded to her social media page from your guild?]</p>
<p>[Yes, we bought them and permanently lent them to her. Those were the only two greatswords on the market.]</p>
<p>“Mm.” I nodded and typed my reply.</p>
<p>[She’s using both?]</p>
<p>[No. Nayun said she’d use the Crusader’s Zweihander only. We lent them both so she could see which one she liked. Once she returns the other artifact, we’ll lend it to another Hero. We couldn’t appraise that one though. It must be because it’s damaged.]</p>
<p>Damaged. Surprisingly, Yoo Yeonha was bad at judging weapons.</p>
<p>Well, I understood where she was coming from since 95% of inappraisable artifacts were trash.</p>
<p>[Don’t give that to someone else. Bring it with you when you come to see me. We’ll meet in North Hamgyeong Province…]</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I spent two days with Evandel, making her pretty clothes, crafting comfortable furniture, and installing the equipment so that she could talk to her friends whenever.</p>
<p>“I should be able to drop by once a week.” Today was the day of farewell. I kneeled in front of Evandel and said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Okay!” Evandel was tearing up but didn’t cry. Instead, she replied cheerfully. Just as I’d grown in the past 8~9 years, Evandel had grown as well. I gave her a warm hug one last time and then called Spartan.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving then.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, so next week, are you coming on Tuesday or Wednesday?”</p>
<p>“Mm, Tuesday.”</p>
<p>“Yay!”</p>
<p>Evandel smiled brightly and nodded.</p>
<p>“Then see you Tuesday.”</p>
<p>“Okay~ I’ll be waiting~”</p>
<p>After waving my hand, I told Spartan of my destination. With a nod, Spartan teleported me to that place.</p>
<p>—Prrrr!</p>
<p>The place we arrived at was Korea’s North Hamgyeong Province. Although it was close to a high-rank monster danger zone and Russia’s Vostok region, where the Evil Society was located, the area had undergone great development through national defense weaponry and magic engineering.</p>
<p>“Keep your eyes out for any strange occurrence! If it gets through, private citizens will be in danger!”</p>
<p>Demon Realm Transformation was underway at the northernmost border of North Hamgyeong Province. The Korean military, along with Heroes dispatched by the Hero Association, were monitoring the situation beyond the [Essence Barrier].</p>
<p>“When are the Hero reinforcements coming?! There’s a battle every hour, shouldn’t there be at least 4 more Heroes here!?”</p>
<p>I glanced at the grumbling soldier. Judging by the symbol on his chest, he seemed to be a captain in charge of this area.</p>
<p>“My apologies. We’re messaging the Association, but they seem to be busy taking care of the aftermath of the recent incident…”</p>
<p>“Who cares about the aftermath!? We need to find out what that thing is and do something about it! Those damned Association bastards….”</p>
<p>The captain yelled and pointed at the field burning black in front of him. About 200 meters of land had turned into the Demon Realm.</p>
<p>—Kuek, kuek.</p>
<p>At that moment, four pillar-sized boars stepped on the demonized land.</p>
<p>“Ah, damn it! I told you to kill them before they touch that land!”</p>
<p>Immediately after the captain shouted…</p>
<p>—Kueeeeeeeek!</p>
<p>The boars’ flesh melted, and they began to charge at the humans as undead monsters.</p>
<p>[Undead Wild Boar] [Intermediate-rank grade-2]</p>
<p>Wild boars had turned into an intermediate-rank monster just by touching the land. The captain soon took out a sword. I also walked toward them with my Desert Eagle in hand.</p>
<p>“Get ready!”</p>
<p>The army quickly prepared themselves for battle.</p>
<p>“Fire on command—!”</p>
<p>Each of their magic bullets cost a million won, but magic bullets without attributes were incapable of killing undead monsters. It seemed their plan was to weaken the boars with magic bullets, then finish them off with the captain who could use magic power.</p>
<p>I decided to help them out.</p>
<p><em>Click—</em></p>
<p>I fired the Desert Eagle. The magic bullet quickly flew towards the dozens of magic bullets shot by the soldiers, displaying a beautiful white color.</p>
<p>—Kuek!</p>
<p>The bullet pierced the four boars one-by-one.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>The bullet moved too quickly for normal human vision, making it look like the boars suddenly fell. While the soldiers were taken aback by the sudden phenomenon, <em>wooong—</em> a golden snowmobile suddenly appeared in the air.</p>
<p>It was the Dwarven Supercar I gifted Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“You’re already here?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha drove down with a smile.</p>
<p>“I just arrived.”</p>
<p>We shook hands while receiving the gaze of countless soldiers. Soon, the captain who recognized Yoo Yeonha’s face rushed over.</p>
<p>“This is Captain Yi Joonkyung. I heard you were coming, but I never expected you to come from the sky!”</p>
<p>“Keep standing on lookout. Don’t mind us.”</p>
<p>“…Yes! Understood!”</p>
<p>The captain took the hint and quickly went away. Yoo Yeonha and I watched the demonized land.</p>
<p>The ground had turned reddish-black, and ominous flames were flickering above it. It looked like a powerful enemy was going to rise from the ground.</p>
<p>“Why did you want to meet me here?”</p>
<p>“I think something will happen here today. I wanted to see what it was and plan accordingly.”</p>
<p>I looked at the system message in front of me.</p>
<p>[Demon Realm Transformation of North Hamgyeong Province is underway. A special change will occur in 20 minutes.]</p>
<p>It was the first ‘special change’ on Earth. I figured I should be here to witness it.</p>
<p>“Really? I don’t have much time… Oh right, here.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha gave me a long piece of metal.</p>
<p>“What’s… oh, that greatsword.”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“But it didn’t look like this on the picture Chae Nayun posted.”</p>
<p>“I infused magic power into it to see what it would do, and it changed into that, like all trash artifacts that can’t handle magic power. It’s really not worth the 3 billion we paid for it.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shrugged.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>I infused Stigma’s magic power into my eyes and began to appraise it with Observation and Reading. There was a big difference between seeing the item in a photo and seeing it in real life.</p>
<p>Observation and Reading quickly appraised the item. I blankly stared at the window that popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>“If you’re interested, you can have it.” Yoo Yeonha spoke.</p>
<p>I flinched. This had to be the work of my luck.</p>
<p>“You’re giving this to me? Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t see why not.”</p>
<p>“…If you say so, I’ll gladly take it.”</p>
<p>I put the sword on my back without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Do you know what this is?”</p>
<p>“I told you, we couldn’t appraise it. Why? Do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>I pitied Yoo Yeonha for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do.”</p>
<p>“You do? Well, I don’t really mind it…”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha didn’t pay much attention to it, as she handed me an envelope of documents.</p>
<p>“This is what we found out about Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, thanks.”</p>
<p>I put the envelope away.</p>
<p>“Also, have you heard?” Yoo Yeonha continued, “A riot broke out in Pandemonium.”</p>
<p>“A riot? What happened?”</p>
<p>“It’s because of the demon town that appeared in Pandemonium. Djinns and demons… something seems to have happened between them. I hear it’s a big secret. Here.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha took out another envelope. I received it with furrowed brows.</p>
<p>“You sure have a lot.”</p>
<p>“It’s a request for a mission.”</p>
<p>“Mission?”</p>
<p>I opened the envelope and took out the documents inside.</p>
<p>The first few words I saw were [Escort Mission Contract].</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled brightly. “I’m going to go to Pandemonium too. So I was wondering if you could act as my escort.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I glanced at Yoo Yeonha before putting the document away. Since I knew nothing about future events, it was probably best to participate in what looked like major plot points.</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>“Think about it positively. If we can excavate the mineral that’s said to be there, it’ll help us deal with future disasters.”</p>
<p>“Mineral?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but, ssh—” Yoo Yeonha suddenly put her finger on her lips. “Looks like you haven’t heard, but I can’t tell you anything until you accept the request.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You have until next week.”</p>
<p>“Hm… Okay.” I nodded.</p>
<p>“Good.” Yoo Yeonha smiled leisurely. She then glanced at the sword that was hanging on my back.</p>
<p>“So, going back to that, you know what it is?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, I do.”</p>
<p>“Ho~ I didn’t know appraising was your hobby.”</p>
<p>“Rather than being a hobby, it’s more that my eyes are good.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re right. So, what is it?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked playfully, but I responded seriously.</p>
<p>“It’s Balmung.”</p>
<p>“Ah~ Balmung~ ….?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha answered with a smile, which soon disappeared as her expression stiffened.</p>
<p>“C-Come again?”</p>
<p>“Balmung. You’ve heard of it, right?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha tilted her head. For the record, I was telling her exactly what I was seeing with Observation and Reading.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Unknown Artifact Sword] [???] [???]</p>
<p>—A greatsword of unknown origin.</p>
<p>[Observation and Reading] with Stigma’s magic power unlocks a portion of the item’s description.</p>
<p>—Balmung.</p>
<p>—The treasure of the Nibelungs acquired by Siegfried. Golden mithril envelops the huge blade like silk.</p>
<p>—It can reflect magic power and its strength is amplified when used in simple ways.</p>
<p>—To become the master of this sword, one must infuse 500ml of one’s blood and have the sword judge one’s qualification.</p>
<p>-More details will be unlocked once the item awakens-</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Haha, you’re funny. Balmung, haha.”</p>
<p>“I’m not kidding.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was trying to escape reality. I, of course, didn’t let her.</p>
<p>“…If you’re not kidding, then that sword… it’s really the Balmung that I know?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked with a stiff face. She stared at the sword on my back with an odd gaze.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s the one written in The Song of the Nibelungs.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha swallowed hard. I was curious about what she was thinking about, but I didn’t have the time to find out.</p>
<p>[The demonized land undergoes a major change.]</p>
<p>The moment a system message popped up in the corner of my eyes…</p>
<p>“U-Um, c-can you return that to m-me….”</p>
<p>And the moment Yoo Yeonha asked stutteringly…</p>
<p><em>KOONG—!</em></p>
<p>The demonized land we were watching erupted with a strange explosion.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Hideout near East Sea]</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jin Sahyuk was looking at the items Kim Hajin left behind in the hideout. A magnifying glass, a robe, Basilisk’s leather, colorful crystals, etc… they seemed inadequate for the time and effort she put into protecting him.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk picked up the magnifying glass from the stash. She tilted her head at first, but it didn’t take her long to figure out what it was. It was the gift the king ‘Prihi’ gave Kim Hajin in the recorded past of Akatrina.</p>
<p>“It was mine to begin with, so…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk put the magnifying glass in her pocket without feeling guilty. She also took a few pieces of Basilisk’s leather and tried on the robe Kim Hajin left behind, which she thought felt excellent.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>A strange vibration reached Jin Sahyuk through the East Sea.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk, who was feeling up Kim Hajin’s robe, stopped and raised her head. Soon, more vibrations rang out.</p>
<p>“What now?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk snickered. Curiosity and desire for excitement swept through her. She finally felt like she could relieve her boredom.</p>
<p>“Kuaaaa~”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stretched and activated Reality Manipulation. A portal popped up in front of her, and another space was stretched out inside it.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>She stepped into the portal without hesitation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 304. Lawless Zone (1)</p>
<p>The first thing I recognized was the explosion. The land turned over and crimson pillars of fire shot up into the air. I saw the flames penetrate the protective walls and stretch out in all directions.</p>
<p>Aether moved before I could think. It stretched towards the flames before turning into a thick barricade that stopped the fire from spreading.</p>
<p>The explosion stopped, but this was only the beginning.</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>The earth shook violently, followed by huge crustal movements.</p>
<p>Everywhere I could see, the earth was starting to slither like a snake. Suddenly, a giant ‘door’ appeared at the center of the transformed land. It was a rectangular, metallic door.</p>
<p>“Uaah, uuk…!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha leaned against me, swaying back and forth from the earthquake. I created a foothold with Aether and stood on top of it with her. Now in a more stable position, Yoo Yeonha let out a dry cough of embarrassment and turned her gaze to the other side.</p>
<p>“…What <em>is</em> that?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea.”</p>
<p>Runic language that I couldn’t understand floated around the mysterious door.</p>
<p>It was a rather strange scene.</p>
<p>I carefully looked over the symbols.</p>
<p>[Interpreting the runes with Gift ‘Observation and Reading’]</p>
<p>[First step to Demon Realm Transformation — Erosion]</p>
<p>[30 days left until the door to the Demon Realm opens]</p>
<p>“…It looks like bad things will happen when that door opens,” Yoo Yeonha said with a frown, “Though I’m not exactly sure what that is-”</p>
<p>“Be quiet while I interpret the runes.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s face distorted into a scowl.</p>
<p>I ignored her and continued with the interpretation.</p>
<p>[This is the ‘Demon Realm Gate’ which increases the rate of Demon Realm Transformation of the land surrounding it.]</p>
<p>“This is the ‘Demon Realm Gate’ which increases the rate of Demon Realm Transformation of the land surrounding it.”</p>
<p>I spoke out loud so that Yoo Yeonha could hear.</p>
<p>She looked more comfortable now.</p>
<p>[30 days from now, the Door of Challenge will open. A total of 200 people may rise to the challenge.]</p>
<p>“30 days from now, the Door of Challenge will open. A total of 200 people may rise to the challenge.”</p>
<p>[If the challengers are victorious, the door will disappear forever.]</p>
<p>[However, if the challengers are defeated, the door will open completely and the ‘devil’ shall descend.]</p>
<p>[Entrance is first come first served.]</p>
<p>The moment I finished the interpretation, demons suddenly rose from the transformed earth. They looked similar to humans except for the horns on their heads, just like the demons I saw in the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>“…The Demon Realm Gate.”</p>
<p>The name sounded strangely familiar.</p>
<p>‘The Demon Realm Gate, the Demon Realm Gate…’</p>
<p>I kept repeating it inside my head. Then I suddenly remembered.</p>
<p>“Ah, this is-”</p>
<p>‘The Demon Realm Gate’ was among the settings I had discarded. It was quite different from regular Erosion.</p>
<p>I went on a hiatus before I could utilize it, but I knew for sure that a new world and challenges were waiting inside it.</p>
<p>It would be the perfect stepping stone for a memorable ending.</p>
<p>“This is- What?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>I shook my head at Yoo Yeonha’s question.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to say, all the information I just told you, be sure to keep them to yourself. I don’t want any Djinns to enter the Gate 30 days from now.”</p>
<p>“…Of course. You didn’t think I’d know that?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shrugged, slightly offended.</p>
<p>“But I already heard everything you said.”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I heard Jin Sahyuk’s voice.</p>
<p>Startled, I turned my head to the side, and there she was, Jin Sahyuk, just as expected.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked at me and Yoo Yeonha and smirked.</p>
<p>“I’ll definitely be one of the 200 challengers.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I was really self-conscious because of Yoo Yeonha. I had to pretend that I had never seen Jin Sahyuk before in my life.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen her before. She’s Crevon’s former Knight Commander,” Yoo Yeonha remarked.</p>
<p>“Ah. You’re right,” I said with a nod.</p>
<p>“…This is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk began digging into her pockets. At the same time, I heard loud footsteps from a distance. Heroes were probably on their way here.</p>
<p>“What is she doing?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha stared at Jin Sahyuk with doubtful eyes. Jin Sahyuk was looking at me through a magnifying glass.</p>
<p>….Wait.</p>
<p>A magnifying glass?</p>
<p>“Hey, hey! Stop!”</p>
<p>I stretched Aether towards the magnifying glass, but….</p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>It shattered into pieces before Aether could reach it.</p>
<p><em>Chwaak….</em></p>
<p>Pieces of glass fell on the ground.</p>
<p>“Damn it.”</p>
<p>I had no idea why the magnifying glass suddenly shattered.</p>
<p>Maybe Jin Sahyuk broke it, or maybe it broke naturally.</p>
<p>But I knew one thing for sure.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>That Jin Sahyuk definitely saw something.</p>
<p>Her widened eyes and dazed expression told me so.</p>
<p>But I didn’t have any time to react.</p>
<p>“Hey! What happened here? I’m the high-intermediate-rank Hero Kim Wajung from Creator’s Sacred Grace!”</p>
<p>Soon, hundreds of Heroes and reporters poured in, and I took my eyes off of Jin Sahyuk for about 1 second.</p>
<p>“…Damn it.”</p>
<p>And Jin Sahyuk was gone.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Heart of Pandemonium — Chameleon Troupe’s Building]</p>
<p>“…A request, you say?”</p>
<p>The next day, Boss received a call from Kim Hajin. He informed her of his decision on accepting a request in the name of Jeronimo’s Fenrir.</p>
<p>—Yes, I was hired as a bodyguard.</p>
<p>Bodyguard. That made sense considering how dangerous Pandemonium was. It was much bigger and far more brutal than any civilian could imagine.</p>
<p>“Are you heading to the west?”</p>
<p>Initially, Pandemonium started in the plains of Mongolia. However, as the Djinns gained more and more power, the territory stretched beyond Xinjiang into Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>—Yes, to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Boss nodded, her gaze fixed on the TV screen.</p>
<p>[The appearance of the ‘Demon Realm Gate’ at the border area of North Hamgyeong Province has driven the Association to call for an emergency meeting….]</p>
<p>Reports of ‘Demon Realm Transformation’ in North Hamgyeong Province were in full swing. Rather than the news, Boss was more focused on Kim Hajin and Jin Sahyuk. Though it was only for a brief moment, Boss saw the two of them together on the screen.</p>
<p>“…Are you going alone?”</p>
<p>—Yes, it’s highly confidential.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She said nothing. But currently, her imagination was running wild.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin continued.</p>
<p>—I’m sorry that I’ve been so busy lately. But my gift should’ve arrived there by now… Boss, did you not get it yet?</p>
<p>“…Gift?”</p>
<p>Boss raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>—Yes. Clothes and a robe.</p>
<p>“I didn’t get any-”</p>
<p>As Boss shook her head, she suddenly recalled last night's strange incident.</p>
<p>Jain was wearing a dress and a robe both of which Boss had never seen before. When Boss asked her about them, Jain, clearly surprised, had answered, “It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>‘Did she really…?’</p>
<p>Boss felt anger well up in her heart.</p>
<p>“It appears that Jain stole them.”</p>
<p>—Ah, Jain? Again?</p>
<p>“Again? I can’t believe this.”</p>
<p>So this wasn’t the first time Jain had done something like this.</p>
<p>‘Why didn’t I notice before?’ Boss wondered. Soon enough, she realized that Jain must have used her ability to disguise as herself.</p>
<p>“Jain…” Boss muttered to herself, “How dare you insult me, your boss?”</p>
<p>Boss clenched her fists.</p>
<p>—Boss?</p>
<p>“I’m hanging up.”</p>
<p>As soon as she hung up, Boss called Jain.</p>
<p>Her hands were shaking with rage, but she tried to remain calm. She knew that even the slightest hint of anger would be enough to drive Jain away.</p>
<p>—Hey, Boss~ What’s up~?</p>
<p>Jain picked up right away, thankfully.</p>
<p>“Jain, where are… Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Boss gulped nervously and put on a smile.</p>
<p>She felt the need to feign kindness in order to lure Jain in.</p>
<p>“Where are you~?”</p>
<p>—…Huh?</p>
<p>Jain had never seen Boss smile and speak so warmly.</p>
<p>Slightly bewildered, Jain began to stutter.</p>
<p>—Um…. I’m at Paris for a party. Why did you call me?</p>
<p>“Ah, nothing~ I was just wondering~ When are you coming home~?”</p>
<p>—…</p>
<p>But Jain felt wary of Boss’s overly friendly demeanor. It was just as the old saying goes, “too much water drowned the miller.”</p>
<p>From the other side of the smartwatch, Jain asked carefully.</p>
<p>—Boss…, did you, um… by any chance… find out…?</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Under the night sky lit with a full moon, Yoo Yeonha left her mansion, concealing herself under a robe and a mask. Only two people were allowed to accompany her on this top secret mission: her secretary ‘Jin Sechan’ and Master-rank Hero ‘Jin Seyeon’. The two had already arrived in Pandemonium and just now sent her a message saying that they found a place to stay.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha once again scrutinized the most crucial piece of information before departing for good.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>《Dimensional Entropy》</p>
<p>—★★★x300000000!! The most important item right now.</p>
<p>—A source of unknown energy. Buried somewhere in Pandemonium’s lawless zone.</p>
<p>—Rumor has it that the Djinns and demons are fighting over it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This was her first and foremost goal.</p>
<p>The name ‘Dimensional Entropy’ was only temporary, because no one knew for sure whether this item was an ore or something entirely different.</p>
<p>But she knew for sure that it was the source of energy that spanned the entire globe.</p>
<p>Therefore, she couldn’t risk having it fall into the hands of the Djinns or other entrepreneurs. Yoo Yeonha believed that only she, the Queen of Seoul, could handle an item of such importance.</p>
<p>“With this, I’ll have the entire world in the palm of my hand.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clenched her fist. It was then, a man appeared from the shadow of the garden. It was, of course, Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha crossed her arms and said, “You’re here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Where’s the Dwarven Supercar?”</p>
<p>“Wait a second.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha approached the pond at the corner of the garden. The water was crystal clear and carp were happily swimming inside it. However, when Yoo Yeonha pushed a button on her smartwatch, <em>shooong</em>— a huge platform ascended from the bottom of the pond.</p>
<p>“Woah…. You did a good job hiding it.”</p>
<p>A Dwarven Supercar, sleek and shiny, was sitting on the platform.</p>
<p>“It’s become my hobby to go out for a ride whenever I’m too stressed. I can’t risk having it stolen.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled.</p>
<p>“Let’s get going, then.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin sat in the front and Yoo Yeonha sat in the back.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin immediately activated [Random Consolidation System]. Suddenly, something amazing happened. Not only did the vehicle become sturdier and more efficient, but its seats also became wider and cozier.</p>
<p>“…You’re really a man of mystery.” That was all Yoo Yeonha could say.</p>
<p>“I’m going to drive slowly, so why don’t you take a nap? This will take at least an hour.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sleepy. More importantly, did you finish reading the Yi Yeonjun files?”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin nodded.</p>
<p>“I did. He’s more dangerous than I thought.”</p>
<p>Currently, Yoo Jinhyuk was in the process of researching Yi Yeonjun’s past based on Kim Hosup’s reports.</p>
<p>Although much research had yet to be done, what he found so far was enough to prove Yi Yeonjun was evil.</p>
<p>“He is.”</p>
<p>He had to get what he wanted at all costs.</p>
<p>He and Yoo Yeonha were similar in that sense, but the difference was that Yi Yeonjun cared for neither rationality nor practicality.</p>
<p>He relied only on violence to meet his needs.</p>
<p>“….Ah, right.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha casually brought up the subject that had kept her awake for days in regret, the question that she had been wanting to ask him for so long.</p>
<p>“You were lying about ‘Balmung’, right?”</p>
<p>He had to be. How could he recognize ‘Balmung’ so quickly when even professional appraisers couldn’t recognize it?</p>
<p>“No, I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>But Kim Hajin was unwavering. Yoo Yeonha felt the confidence in his voice. It made her heart heavy.</p>
<p>“…Then give it back.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha caught Kim Hajin by the sleeve and pulled feebly.</p>
<p>“Give it back.”</p>
<p>“…Give what back?”</p>
<p>“I was going to give it to Nayun anyway….”</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>Though Yoo Yeonha was starting to sound pitiful, Kim Hajin only smiled.</p>
<p>“Okay, how about we make it a lease? I want more shares.”</p>
<p>“You have plenty already.”</p>
<p>“No,” Kim Hajin shook his head bitterly and said, “I need a lot more to prepare for the future.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Pandemonium — Kazakhstan Lawless Zone]</p>
<p>In the face of the recent monster invasion, most Central Asian countries had declared the dissolution of state. Kazakhstan was one of such countries. Still, its legacy lived on as humanity began to refer to the lawless zone as ‘Kazakhstan’, for that was where it was.</p>
<p>“We’re here.”</p>
<p>The sky was starting to fade when we arrived at the ‘Kazakhstan Lawless Zone’, which was notorious for its, well, lawlessness.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>The flight was exactly 1 hour. Before landing, I woke up Yoo Yeonha, who had fallen asleep in the back seat while working. I then put the Dwarven Supercar inside the ‘vehicular spatial pouch’ that Yoo Yeonha had prepared in advance.</p>
<p>“…Are you sure we’re at the lawless zone?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha muttered doubtfully. For a land that was infested with over 3 billion monsters, everything seemed surprisingly peaceful.</p>
<p>“Just because this is the lawless zone doesn’t mean everyone is fighting 24/7. There are Circles here.”</p>
<p>“Ah~ I get it.”</p>
<p>“Because-”</p>
<p>“I researched it in advance. I don’t need your explanation.”</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>A Circle referred to a group of Djinns, similar to ‘Satan’s Servants’. All Djinns living in the lawless zone were a member of a Circle, be it big or small. Things were peaceful right now because there was a balance of power between different Circles. One hasty move could lead to a full-blown war, as insulting a member of a Circle was tantamount to insulting the Circle itself.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yoo Yeonha pointed into the distance.</p>
<p>“Look, over there. Looks like they even sell food here.”</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to where Yoo Yeonha was pointing.</p>
<p>[Skewered Pork]</p>
<p>A stall was there. It had large chunks of meat placed on wooden skewers for display.</p>
<p>However, as evident from the way Yoo Yeonha was drooling, it was not an ordinary meat. In fact, it was the meat of an intermediate-rank grade-5 monster, [Effellie Boar]. Effellie boars live only in Central Asia, so there was no way to get it in Korea.</p>
<p>“Should we get some?”</p>
<p>“…Well, if you insist.”</p>
<p>Together we approached the stall. A grim-faced Djinn was roasting the meat.</p>
<p>I asked, “How much?”</p>
<p>The Djinn glanced at me and replied, “300,000 won, or 300 DP.”</p>
<p>It seemed that in Pandemonium, both won and DP were widely used.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“Fuck that.”</p>
<p>“…Eh? W-What?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha seemed surprised at my sudden cursing.</p>
<p>I could easily pay 300000 won, of course. But like I said, all Djinns belonged to a Circle. So if I let this one undermine me, the members of the Circle that he belonged to would do the same.</p>
<p>In the society of Djinns, weakness was considered a sin.</p>
<p>“‘Fuck that’?”</p>
<p>The vendor glared at me. Though he appeared quite threatening, he failed to scare me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, fuck that.”</p>
<p>“Then get lost.”</p>
<p>“I would, but you haven’t sold me the food yet.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha seemed confused.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you? I told you we have to be secretive,” she whispered, but I ignored her.</p>
<p>“…Are you gonna pay in DP or won?”</p>
<p>The Djinn finally gave up.</p>
<p>“Won.”</p>
<p>“70,000 won each.”</p>
<p>That sounded much more reasonable. Having received a discount, I payed 250000 won for 4 skewers.</p>
<p>…5 minutes later.</p>
<p>“It tastes even more amazing because of the discount. Let’s head over to the hotel now.”</p>
<p><em>Nom, nom—</em> We munched on the meat as we walked towards the hotel.</p>
<p>“This place is far more dangerous than you think. Remember to keep your robe on at all times.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know. …Ah, there it is.”</p>
<p>Finally a hotel came into our view.</p>
<p>It was a wooden building that looked more like a pub than a hotel. The name of the hotel was [Djinn Days]— obviously very cheesy.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>We went in.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“Wow, this is surprising.”</p>
<p>Our eyes widened the moment we opened the door.</p>
<p>Though the hotel appeared shabby on the outside, the lobby was big and even had a bar. There were lots of customers as well.</p>
<p>“Let’s get going.”</p>
<p>“Okay. They said room 303….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha quickly passed through the lobby. However, just as she was about to set foot on the staircase, I saw a man sitting alone at a corner table. I had no idea why, but he stood out to me.</p>
<p>He had disheveled hair and a bushy beard. Right then, the morning sunlight seeped through the window and shone over the man's face.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Immediately my hair stood on end.</p>
<p>The man leaning against the window—I wasn’t sure if he was drunk or just sleepy—I had seen him before through Spartan’s eyes and also in the composite sketches.</p>
<p>It was Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 305. Lawless Zone (2)</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was sitting at a table in the lobby. It was certainly the same Yi Yeonjun I saw through Spartan’s eyes.</p>
<p>At first, my thoughts stopped. If Yi Yeonjun was nearby or up to something suspicious, Spartan would have told me about it.</p>
<p>But as surprised as I was, I made sure to not stare at him for more than 3 seconds. Yi Yeonjun should know my face. It would be bad if he saw me here.</p>
<p>—Spartan, where are you.</p>
<p>I transmitted my thoughts to Spartan as I quickly climbed up the stairs.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Soon, Spartan’s thoughts returned. Right, he had been sleeping. I was a bit dumbfounded, but I quickly understood. Spartan’s stamina was fairly low, after all.</p>
<p>—Did you sleep well? You know, Yi Yeonjun is right here.</p>
<p>—…!</p>
<p>Spartan’s consciousness spiked up. He then gave an excuse, ‘I planned to chase him after a quick nap. I only slept six hours.’</p>
<p>—Don’t worry about it. From now, just tell me if you’re going to sleep. Seeing Yi Yeonjun here startled me. Anyways, continue following him once you’re refreshed.</p>
<p>I ordered Spartan, who began to wash his face at a nearby lake. He would probably eat something before heading over.</p>
<p>“What are you doing over there?” Yoo Yeonha asked while leaning against the guardrail.</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Yi Yeonjun one last time. He was sipping on alcohol, seemingly exchanging Mental Transmissions with Bell.</p>
<p>“Do you want to grab a drink? We don’t have much time.” Yoo Yeonha asked again.</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing, really.” I shrugged and continued moving.</p>
<p>After arriving in room 302, Yoo Yeonha and I met two people who were waiting for us, Jin Sechan and Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Hajin-ssi.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon greeted me with her unique gentle smile.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. We’ve seen each other before. I hope you remember me.”</p>
<p>Next, Jin Sechan respectfully reached out with his hand. He was Yoo Yeonha’s secretary.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, how can I forget. I’m still using the Desert Eagle you gave me.”</p>
<p>I shook his hand, then took off my robe. Jin Seyeon took it and smoothly hung it on the hanger. Yoo Yeonha then sat at the head of the table and began the meeting.</p>
<p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
<p>With a cough, she put on a serious expression.</p>
<p>“I’m sure you all know why we’re gathered here.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha projected a holographic video with her smartwatch. The video took place deep underground in first-person view. Faint lights hung from the ceiling, which were the only sources of light lighting the dark surroundings.</p>
<p>“The footage is taken by our agent. He infiltrated Pandemonium five years ago, disguising himself as a Djinn.”</p>
<p><em>Koong— Koong— Koong—</em></p>
<p>Large rumbling rang out. The agent marched towards the source of the sound. Yoo Yeonha sped up this part of the footage to 16x speed until the agent arrived at the end of what seemed like a mine shaft.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>And at the end of the mine shaft was the item Yoo Yeonha wanted to get.</p>
<p>“This is the transcendental energy I dubbed, ‘Dimensional Entropy.’”</p>
<p>Dozens of Djinns were surrounding a spherical ore emitting a dark-green glow.</p>
<p>—What are we going to do with this? The demons in the north are demanding it.</p>
<p>—…I’d hand it over to Terror before handing it to those bastards.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha then stopped the footage.</p>
<p>“As you can see, demons and Djinns aren’t getting along, or at least these demons in the north. Not only do demons look more grotesque, but they also seem to be serving a different devil. Furthermore, demons don’t have money. DP is distributed by demon merchants, who are different entities than normal demons.”</p>
<p>A few months before Orden was defeated, ‘demons’ and ‘demon merchants’ appeared in the world. Although they both came from the Demon Realm, they were treated in completely different manners.</p>
<p>—I don’t know about that either. If we give this to Terror, who knows what he’ll do with it. Wouldn’t it be better to go with Wicked, who’s more moderate…?</p>
<p>—No.</p>
<p>The Djinn who seemed to be the leader shook his head.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha paused the footage again and explained, “By the way, that Djinn is Vicious. The original Vicious died and a new Djinn took his place. He is currently the lowest ranked member of the Nine Evils, but because he united several Djinn Circles, he has a powerful influence over this lawless zone. Now, keep watching.”</p>
<p>Vicious spoke as soon as the footage resumed.</p>
<p>—This ore has enough power to destroy the balance of Djinn society. If it falls into the hands of demons, we will have no choice but to submit to them. But if it falls into Terror or Wicked’s hands, we don’t know what they’ll do with it. Now unfortunately, we can’t have it ourselves since we don’t have the strength to protect it or the means to utilize it.</p>
<p>At that moment, several system windows popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Information has been added due to witnessing a special setting change.]</p>
<p>[Dimensional Entropy – clusters of condensed energy created when demons crossed over dimensions.]</p>
<p>[Co-author’s opinion – using it properly will be of help to you.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘Co-author’s opinion… He’s been talking more and more recently. Is it because the ending is approaching?’ I sighed and smiled. Regardless of the co-author’s intentions, I wanted it if it would be of help.</p>
<p>I had to prepare for the final arc thoroughly, no matter how slow I do it. That way, everyone could reach the proper ending.</p>
<p>—So instead, we will sell it to humans for money and artifacts. Oi, Licros!</p>
<p>When Vicious yelled the name ‘Licros’, the camera moved towards Vicious. That seemed to be the name of Yoo Yeonha’s agent.</p>
<p>—Go to Essence of the Strait. Tell them I, Vicious, will sell them a life-changing item.</p>
<p>With that, Yoo Yeonha stopped the video.</p>
<p>“That’s how this mission came about. You get the gist, right?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon and I both nodded.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha continued with her arms still crossed, “But that ore can’t be transferred through normal means. Because of its size, it is too noticeable and making contact with magic power causes it to explode. We determined we needed a special case and a special vehicle to move it.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha paused, and Jin Sechan stepped up. He put out a case on the table.</p>
<p>“This is a tilionium case. Lightning magic has been applied to it already. With the information we received from Vicious, we built it to withstand the Dimensional Entropy’s energy.”</p>
<p>“Mm… so we’re going to put the ore in the case and transport it with the Dwarven Supercar?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shook her head at my question.</p>
<p>“The Dwarven Supercar operates using magic power. Even with the case protecting it, it still isn’t a hundred percent safe. We prepared another vehicle for this mission. We’ll go back to Korea on it.”</p>
<p>“…Is there a reason you came personally? It’s a bit dangerous to return to Korea from here over land.”</p>
<p>I was worried for Yoo Yeonha’s safety. She was only high-intermediate-rank grade-2. Although her growth speed was quick given her age, it was still nowhere near geniuses like Chae Nayun or Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha stiffened her expression resolutely.</p>
<p>“This is my job, so I will do it. Plus, only the five of us can know about this.”</p>
<p>‘Five of us… Ah, including the agent.’ I thought.</p>
<p>“According to international law, ‘mysterious items transcending common sense’ have to be turned over to the Association. But knowing the corruption within the Association, we can’t let other people find out.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon quickly replied to Yoo Yeonha, “I agree. Yeonha-ssi is far more trustworthy than the Association.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? You really think so?” I asked. The Hero Association loved Jin Seyeon more than any other Hero.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon answered with a bitter smile, “I’m very disappointed with the Hero Association because of the recent incident. Park Hanho, the Girl of Authority… the Association seems to have lost their founding principles. That’s why I decided to follow Yeonha-ssi.”</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>The Association kept the Girl of Authority’s kidnapping a secret. It wasn’t until Park Hanho’s betrayal that it was revealed to the world, causing a huge discussion. As the person who planned her abduction, it did sting my conscience a bit.</p>
<p>“Oh right, did Park Hanho’s daughter really come back to life?”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Ah, I don’t know that much…”</p>
<p>“No.” Yoo Yeonha answered my question. “That girl isn’t Park Hanho’s real daughter. It was a chameleon humanoid monster who had Park Yeonhee’s brain transplanted. It could be argued, I guess, since the humanoid monster really believed she was Park Yeonhee.”</p>
<p>“Ah… I see. Then, Yeonha-ssi, do you know what the Association will do about Senior Park Hanho…?” Jin Seyeon asked bitterly.</p>
<p>“Execution would be my guess.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere turned grim at Yoo Yeonha’s words. Cold wind seeped in from the window. Blood and magic power were mixed in the air.</p>
<p><em>Chak, chak!</em></p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clapped to lighten up the mood and the air. She spoke with a smile, “…Let’s stop talking and rest. We’ll have to wake up early tomorrow.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Vicious’s Mine Shaft]</p>
<p>We went underground to Vicious’s mine shaft early in the morning. We weren’t here to sightsee, so we quickly moved. I carried a spatial pouch filled with 50 billion won and Jin Seyeon carried six high-rank artifacts, both of which would be traded for [Dimensional Entropy].</p>
<p>“…Hand over the items and money first.”</p>
<p>In a dark underground space, Vicious and his comrades stood before us. They showed no signs of compromise.</p>
<p>“50 billion won, cash. The artifacts will be given once we retrieve the item and leave the lawless zone.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha took the spatial pouch from me and threw it over to Vicious. One of his comrades checked the content of the pouch.</p>
<p>“50,000 won bills, 100,000 of them. It’s 50 billion won, alright.”</p>
<p>“…Great, you know that us Djinns hate checks.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smirked at Vicious’s words.</p>
<p>“The spatial pouch will be a gift. It’s a pinnacle-grade spatial pouch, so it’ll easily go for 3 billion won on the market.”</p>
<p>The Djinn holding the spatial pouch flinched. He then glanced down at the spatial pouch in shock.</p>
<p>Vicious stared at Yoo Yeonha fixedly before taking a deep breath and nodding.</p>
<p>“Good. We’ll open the way. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Vicious turned around first, and we followed after him.</p>
<p><em>Tak, tak.</em> The path became narrower the more we walked. The soot in the air stuck to our skin. Even qi reinforcement was useless here.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s breathing became rough. Jin Sechan looked at her with worry.</p>
<p>After about 5 minutes of walking…</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a fierce gust of magic power blew over. The magic power put heavy pressure on our bodies.</p>
<p>I held myself back from vomiting and walked over.</p>
<p>“It’s here.” Vicious spoke.</p>
<p>We looked forward in a daze. <em>Chwaaa….</em> A mysterious, spherical ore was pulsing with dark green magic power.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Dimensional Entropy] [Durability 10/10]</p>
<p>—A transcendental stone condensed with the power of multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>—Will release magic power until its durability runs out.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Take it. If you can, that is.”</p>
<p>This time, I stepped up. With Aether, I grabbed the Dimensional Entropy. The ore was only the size of a baseball, but it weighed over a ton. Aether burned from the ore’s searing magic power.</p>
<p>“…Whew.”</p>
<p>I carried the Dimensional Entropy over and put it inside the tilonium case. The case hugged the ore gently and sealed it inside.</p>
<p>The dark green color lighting the mine shaft immediately subsided, and the queasy feeling in my stomach disappeared.</p>
<p>“Oh? As expected of Essence of the Strait. That’s an interesting piece of equipment. Is it light?”</p>
<p>“It’s enchanted with weight reducing magic.”</p>
<p>I picked up the case. Yoo Yeonha turned around without a word. She seemed to be in a hurry to leave.</p>
<p>Then again, most girls wouldn’t want to be in mine shafts.</p>
<p>Jin Sechan quickly followed her, and Jin Seyeon handed over the six artifacts she had with her.</p>
<p>“Here you go.”</p>
<p>“Ohoho. Oi, Lilac! Appraise them.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, Hajin-ssi. I’ll finish the trade.”</p>
<p>I took Jin Seyeon to her word and left the mine shaft. There were two identical cars waiting outside the mine shaft. They were made with adamantium, the strongest known metal in the modern world. The windows were jet-black. It was easy to see that the two sedans had the sturdiness of war tanks.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>Knocks rang out from the car parked in the front.</p>
<p>I opened the passenger seat with the tilonium case in hand.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>The back seat was for Yoo Yeonha, but a man I didn’t know was sitting in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>Seeing that I was standing in a daze, Yoo Yeonha explained.</p>
<p>“…You saw him in the video, right? This is that agent, Licros. I got a separate driver so you can focus on guarding the item.”</p>
<p>Licros looked at me and nodded.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>I greeted him back and sat down next to him.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke, “We’ll leave once Jin Seyeon-ssi comes back.”</p>
<p>Jin Sechan and Jin Seyeon would ride the other car, which was prepared just in case anything happened.</p>
<p>Soon, Jin Seyeon came out of the mine shaft and got on the driver’s seat of the other car. As Jin Sechan was already sitting in the back seat, Jin Seyeon started the engine and took off.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Licros nodded his head and stepped on the accelerator.</p>
<p><em>Vroooom—</em></p>
<p>The sound of a gas engine was rather nostalgic, as I often teleported from place to place.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Yoo Yeonha began to act strangely in the back seat. She moaned, hit her chest, and bit her nails.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>When I asked, she was massaging her temple with both hands.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I’m fine. It’s just that I hate confined spaces.”</p>
<p>“Oh… you have claustricphobia?”</p>
<p>“…It’s claustrophobia, not claustricphobia. And yeah, I’m a bit embarrassed to say it, but it’s pretty severe.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>As the person who created Yoo Yeonha’s background setting, I obviously knew about it. It wasn’t just claustrophobia. Germaphobia, paranoia, coulrophobia… Yoo Yeonha was fated to live with countless mental illnesses.</p>
<p>These mental illnesses would only continue to worsen, as she would be under constant threat of assassination given her position.</p>
<p>“Just sleep. I’ll take care of the rest.”</p>
<p>“…Heh, okay.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha laughed and nodded her head.</p>
<p>The sedan left the heart of the lawless zone and reached the outskirts. I looked outside the window with my senses heightened. I couldn’t sense any threat.</p>
<p>“We’re about to leave the lawless zone,” I said.</p>
<p>“Got it.” Yoo Yeonha seemed to be feeling better as she replied with a smile. “Oh right, the Association finished deciphering the runic language around the ‘Demon Realm Gate. They should start gathering Heroes officially in a few days.”</p>
<p>“Gathering Heroes?”</p>
<p>“200 people need to be present to enter the Demon Realm Gate. You’re going to participate too, right?”</p>
<p>“Why would I? I can just sneak in.”</p>
<p>“…Pft, I won’t help you if you get caught.”</p>
<p>I shrugged, and Yoo Yeonha leaned back. As she looked comfortable, I didn’t worry about her too much.</p>
<p>I faced front.</p>
<p>…From the front, something sharp was flying over.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Before I could perceive it, it broke through the window. Bullet Time didn’t activate. Something simply pierced through the window, and the driver’s head exploded in the next moment.</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>A dazed voice rang out. I turned to the side. Licros’s head was missing, replaced by an arrow.</p>
<p>I turned around. Licros’s blood and brain fluid were covering Yoo Yeonha’s body.</p>
<p>“What….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha muttered blankly, and in the next moment, another arrow flew over. I released Aether, forming a shield. The arrow hit the shield, veering slightly off course and piercing Yoo Yeonha’s shoulder rather than her head.</p>
<p>“Kyaak!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha screamed, and I immediately shouted louder.</p>
<p>“DUCK!”</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha didn’t listen. She wasn’t in any state to do so. She was in a panic. This was probably the first time she witnessed such a gory death.</p>
<p>I couldn’t use ‘Time Reversal’ either because it was on cooldown.</p>
<p>I quickly strengthen the sedan with Aether and Stigma.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaak—</em></p>
<p>Aether enveloped the car. A mere arrow wouldn’t be able to break the sedan anymore, but I couldn’t do anything about the shattered window.</p>
<p>I shouted loudly, “Duck! Duck, Yoo Yeonha—!”</p>
<p>“Ah, aah, aah…”</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha was having trouble even breathing normally. She was clutching her arms and whimpering.</p>
<p>Another magic arrow flew over. As expected, it wasn’t enough to break through the car, which was strengthened with Aether and Stigma.</p>
<p>Using this time, I moved over to the back seat. Yoo Yeonha was clearly having a panic attack, shaking like a schizophrenic. I pushed her head down first.</p>
<p>“Calm down. Calm down.”</p>
<p>I caressed her head with Stigma’s magic power and said, “It’s me. Look at me!”</p>
<p>Hearing me, Yoo Yeonah slowly raised her head. She stared at me with eyes full of fear. Tears were flowing down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Kuhuk!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha suddenly coughed. A piece of Licros’s shattered skull came out of her mouth. Yoo Yeonha saw it too. She seemed to have swallowed it subconsciously. Immediately, her eyes rolled over, and her body swayed.</p>
<p>“Hey, snap out of it!”</p>
<p>“T-This…”</p>
<p>“Just keep your head down. We just have to keep out of the shooter’s firing line. The arrow can only come in through the broken window since it can’t do anything about the car.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Got it?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded her head.</p>
<p>“…Geez, talk about a surprise.”</p>
<p>I muttered to myself and sent a Mental Transmission to Jin Seyeon. Is this what people felt when they faced Black Lotus?</p>
<p>“Jin Seyeon-ssi, where are you!?”</p>
<p>She quickly responded.</p>
<p>—Hajin-ssi! We’re…</p>
<p><em>Tzzt—</em></p>
<p>However, her message was cut in the middle. They seemed to be under attack as well. Without a choice, I called Spartan over and took out the Desert Eagle.</p>
<p>There was nothing I could do inside the car.</p>
<p>But as I was about to leave the car…</p>
<p>“W-Wait!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha grabbed my hand strongly.</p>
<p>“A-Are you going somewhere?”</p>
<p>“…You wait here. It’ll be safer.”</p>
<p>“No, no! I don’t want to!”</p>
<p>I shook off Yoo Yeonha’s hand and opened the door. Yoo Yeonha reached out and shouted desperately, “Don’t go! Don’t go—!”</p>
<p>But I left and was immediately greeted by an arrow. Bullet Time didn’t activate this time either. Instead, a system window popped up alerting me why.</p>
<p>[Warning! You are facing a sharpshooter possessing a similar level of Gift. Master Sharpshooter’s sub-Gift will be temporarily sealed.]</p>
<p>“Similar level my ass….”</p>
<p>I gritted my teeth and took out the Desert Eagle. If our Gifts were on a similar level, I just had to strengthen mine with Stigma.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>It was then that I realized something important. To transform the Desert Eagle into its sniper rifle form, I needed ‘Aether’.</p>
<p>But Aether was currently fused with the car, protecting Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>As such, I could only use… my ‘bow’ and ‘arrow’.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 306. Lawless Zone (3)</p>
<p>I hid behind the car and sent a command to Spartan. He quickly appeared in the sky and looked down at us.</p>
<p><em>Whooosh—!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, another arrow flew towards us, targeting the car’s tire. Aether tried to protect it, but because the tire wasn’t strong to begin with, it couldn’t withstand the attack even with Aether’s help.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>The tire popped like a balloon as Spartan shared his field of vision with me.</p>
<p>I could see the enemy about 5km to the east. It wouldn't be hard to see him at first through Spartan’s eyes, but his location was made very clear in the next moment when he shot an arrow at Spartan.</p>
<p>—…!</p>
<p>Spartan flapped his wings and dodged the attack, but the arrow quickly turned and chased after Spartan.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa….</em> The fiercely flying arrow was quicker than Spartan. At this rate, Spartan would die as well.</p>
<p>The moment the arrow grazed Spartan’s feathers, I ordered him to escape. Spartan teleported out just in time, and the arrow pierced through thin air. But at that moment, an unpleasant system alert popped up.</p>
<p>[Spartan’s wing has been injured – he is unable to use his Authority.]</p>
<p>I bit my lips. Returning to my normal field of vision, I looked around the surroundings. We were attacked in the outskirts of the lawless zone. Although a few pubs and inns were nearby, fights were commonplace here. Even if I asked someone for help, it was unlikely for any of them to listen to me.</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>The only thing protecting me was a sedan enveloped in Aether. I was running out of time. I doubted that the sedan could withstand the enemy’s terrifying arrows any more than this.</p>
<p>Without any other choice, I took out [Temujin’s Bow Blessed By Horus] and [Athena’s Moonlight Arrow]. I didn’t hesitate much. To save Yoo Yeonha and to save myself, I needed to do this.</p>
<p>The moment I grabbed the arrow, Master Sharpshooter’s senses heightened. I looked to the east. My vision quickly stretched out until it reached my target 5km away.</p>
<p>I finally caught a glimpse of the sharpshooter that attacked us.</p>
<p>It was a woman holding a black bow. Her dark eyes seemed to be staring at me directly.</p>
<p>No, she was most certainly staring at me. Our eyes exchanged glances from 5km away.</p>
<p><em>Kiiik—</em></p>
<p>The enemy pulled her bowstring.</p>
<p>For some reason, I felt like I knew her. Blue hair flowing down over her black leather armor. Slightly tanned skin and fair facial features… The sharpshooter looked just like the person I imagined while I was writing.</p>
<p>“…Leraje.”</p>
<p>That should be her name. She was one of the ten devils I thought of using for the final part of the story – Leraje the Green Devil.</p>
<p>As her title suggested, green was her symbolic color, but the background story was that she hated green so much that she dyed her green hair blue.</p>
<p>Leraje held more moderate views among the devils, and by the looks of it, she still seemed to be staying in her incarnation body.</p>
<p>Still, she was the sole archer among devils. She was not an opponent I could deal with easily.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>Why was the 14th ranked devil here?</p>
<p>I was annoyed by the sudden turn of events, but I knew complaining about it wouldn’t do me any good.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and nocked [Athena’s Moonlight Arrow] onto my bow. Then, I poured everything I had into it: Stigma’s magic power, Random Consolidation System, Constraints and Amplifications.</p>
<p>A terrifying magic power descended on the moonlight arrow, and brilliant rays of light began to stretch out in all directions. The moonlight’s holy power enveloped the earth and sky. I aimed the cluster of light at the devil and pulled the bowstring strongly.</p>
<p>…But due to Leraje’s strange reaction, I didn’t fire the arrow.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>She put her bow down and stared at me. Her gaze held no hostility or killing intent. Her expressionless face only showed her cold beauty.</p>
<p>After staring at me for a long time, Leraje muttered.</p>
<p>—My name.</p>
<p>A fleeting voice came out of her coy lips. Next, Leraje suddenly put away her bow and arrows.</p>
<p>I couldn’t understand what brought on the sudden change, but it was clear she no longer had any desire to attack. As such, I put my bow down as well.</p>
<p>In that instant, Leraje’s form disappeared like a mirage.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>I was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Did my arrow scare her away? No, I doubt that’s the case…”</p>
<p>No matter the reason, the current situation was better for me. Not only did I conserve my strength, but I also didn’t have to risk my life fighting her to the death.</p>
<p>[A huge luck erupted!]</p>
<p>[A Single Word Pays Back a Debt of a Thousand Gold – Your thoughtless mumbling saved your life!]</p>
<p>[The great ‘Rank 14 Devil – Leraje’ takes interest in the human who recognized her.]</p>
<p>[Information regarding Leraje has been added to your Gift 「Observation and Reading」.]</p>
<p>[You obtain 333SP!]</p>
<p>[Narrow Escape from Death (7/9) – Special stat, Accumulation of Luck, becomes partly unlocked!]</p>
<p>Narrow Escape from Death popped up once again.</p>
<p>“That was luck too?”</p>
<p>I exclaimed in surprise, then I remembered someone.</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>I quickly ran to the side of the sedan and opened the door. Yoo Yeonha was sitting in the corner, her face pale and her body trembling.</p>
<p>The inside of the car looked different than just now. The remnants of Licros’s corpse were nowhere to be seen, and a hot current of electricity was crackling inside.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had burned Licros’s blood, flesh, and bones into nothingness.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[North Pandemonium – Undeveloped Area]</p>
<p>In the Russian land north of Pandemonium, a temple no human knew about existed.</p>
<p>Monsters swarmed the area, and the temple was shrouded by tall coniferous forest. Inside this dark temple, countless Djinns and demons were gathered to worship the rank 14th devil.</p>
<p>“…She should be fine on her own, right?” The Djinn assigned to this temple, Destruction, said worryingly. In front of him were many Djinns and a few demons who were waiting for their lord to return.</p>
<p>“The outside world is dangerous… We know what happened to Plucas.”</p>
<p>Destruction was always interested in the descent of the devil he was serving. When signs of Demon Realm Transformation appeared, he helped the descent of the rank 14 devil more carefully than any other Djinn.</p>
<p>Destruction took care so that no one would find out about his lord’s descent. He knew very well what happened to Rank 50 Devil Plucas, whose existence was revealed to the world.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Lord Leraje is a noble who is among the strongest in the Demon Realm.”</p>
<p>But the devil’s henchman seemed to be carefree. Corte, the most human-looking servant among the demons, said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Lord Leraje isn’t someone a mere human can injure.”</p>
<p>And at that moment, Leraje returned to the temple. Her ability allowed her to change the composition of her body freely. She took the form of wind and quickly arrived at her throne.</p>
<p>The servants waiting for her all bowed with respect.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>But Corte noticed something. Leraje didn’t have the [Dimensional Entropy] in her hands. That was the object she had left to obtain personally.</p>
<p>At that moment, Corte’s gaze met Leraje’s. Corte flinched, while Leraje simply gave a command.</p>
<p>—Rise.</p>
<p>Her command wasn’t in the form of words. She projected letters using Earth’s technology known as a smartwatch.</p>
<p>This was a small constraint placed on Leraje. She had to expend her lifeforce every time she spoke, so she used this smartwatch given by Destruction to express her thoughts.</p>
<p>—I didn’t bring the object you talked about.</p>
<p>Corte and Destruction stared at the words appearing in the air.</p>
<p>—There was a mysterious human who knew my name.</p>
<p>With that, Leraje leaned against her throne. Her youthful look and soft figure shone seductively.</p>
<p>Corte was displeased. [Dimensional Entropy] was an important item in the descent of a devil, yet Leraje had given up because she took interest in a mere human.</p>
<p>“Lord, you are a nobleman renowned across the Demon Realm. It isn’t strange for tales of Lord’s strength to have spread to Earth. So how can it be strange for—”</p>
<p>Leraje furrowed her brows and cut him off.</p>
<p>—Humans don’t know me. This isn’t the Demon Realm.</p>
<p><em>Tadadak—</em> Leraje typed on the holographic keyboard as she looked around her surroundings.</p>
<p>—He even knew my name.</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>—Of course, I don’t lie.</p>
<p>Next, Leraje yawned. As her descent wasn’t fully complete, Leraje slept often.</p>
<p>—I’m sleepy.</p>
<p>—Wake me up if those old devils contact us.</p>
<p>—Look into the human who recognized me too.</p>
<p>—He really was quite interesting.</p>
<p>With four final messages, Leraje fell asleep.</p>
<p>Corte stared at Leraje’s sleeping figure and then faced Destruction next to him.</p>
<p>“Destruction.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord.”</p>
<p>“…Look into this human Lord Leraje has taken interest in. You’ll also have to bring back the [Dimensional Entropy].”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Destruction widened his eyes in surprise, then put on a deep smile. This was exactly what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>From what he recently learned, the human who took the [Dimensional Entropy] was none other than the daughter of Yoo Jinwoong.</p>
<p>“Understood, leave it to me.”</p>
<p>Destruction replied and laughed happily.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Central Asia]</p>
<p>I threw the car away. It could be repaired, but it was already too tattered, and in its current state, it was at a huge risk of being attacked again.</p>
<p>I summoned Sannuri, who I turned into a card, and ran with Yoo Yeonha. Sannuri was burdened by the [Dimensional Entropy] I was carrying, but she was still as quick as ever.</p>
<p><em>Click— Clack—</em></p>
<p>As Sannuri sped forward, I checked Yoo Yeonha’s condition. She was trembling sporadically, her body was freezing, and her breathing was labored. Like a bird drenched in rain, her frail body was devoid of strength.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha needed time to rest.</p>
<p>I saw a natural cave surrounded by greenery with my Thousand-Mile Eyes, and I led Sannuri to it.</p>
<p>“Get down.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha came down from Sannuri’s back without a word. She staggered but didn’t fall. She sat down against the cave wall, pretending to be fine, and stared at me. I took this moment to message Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>“Jin Seyeon-ssi, are you okay?”</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p><em>Tzzt.</em> Static noise rang out a few times before she returned a reply.</p>
<p>—Yes, we managed to survive. The car broke down, but we were able to escape. Where are you now?</p>
<p>As expected, a Master-rank Hero wasn’t so easily killed. It seemed she even managed to protect Jin Sechan.</p>
<p>“I’ll send you the coordinates. Tell me if you’re too far.”</p>
<p>I sent her our current location. After a brief silence, a troubled voice rang out.</p>
<p>—Yes, we’re far, perhaps two days away on foot. We went in different directions after all…</p>
<p>“Then send me your location. I’ll pick you up.”</p>
<p>—Pick me up?</p>
<p>I looked at Sannuri. She immediately understood my intention and snorted unhappily.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have a horse with me. She’s incredibly smart, beautiful, and kind.”</p>
<p>Sannuri’s expression brightened. Jin Seyeon’s confused voice rang out.</p>
<p>—…A horse?</p>
<p>“Yes. Anyways, send me your coordinates first.”</p>
<p>—Ah… yes.</p>
<p>Soon, my smartwatch beeped, and I showed Jin Seyeon’s location to Sannuri.</p>
<p>Sannuri stared at the coordinate for about 10 seconds before neighing with a nod. She seemed to be in a good mood.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty far, huh? You can run as much as you want.”</p>
<p>—Hiiing.</p>
<p>“Yep, you don’t have to carry anyone on your way there, so run as quickly as you want. If you run into any monster or demons, feel free to kill them all.”</p>
<p>—Hiiing!</p>
<p>Sannuri cried cheerfully before immediately bolting out of the cave. <em>Whoosh—!</em> She was as quick as lightning. Black soot flickered above the ground she passed over.</p>
<p>“…Haha.”</p>
<p>I chuckled and sat down as well. It was then that I noticed Yoo Yeonha staring at me fixedly from the side. Her face was pale white, like a patient who was on the brink of fainting.</p>
<p>I met her gaze, then smirked.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded. Did she lose her ability to speak? She hadn’t said a word since she got on Sannuri.</p>
<p>To lighten up the mood and to make her talk, I said mischievously, “You look like you’re going to die soon.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha didn’t say a word. She only stared at me fixedly. Then, after a long time, she gulped and said simply, “I saw it.”</p>
<p>“Saw what?” I asked back nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“You using a bow.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a gust of wind blew through the cave. The wind made a strange humming sound echoing off the walls, and I couldn’t hear Yoo Yeonha properly because of it.</p>
<p>“…You saw?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” She nodded resolutely.</p>
<p>“Your bow, your arrow, and the huge undulation of magic power you aimed at the enemy.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Thinking about it now, I was the idiot for not even suspecting it. Even when we were in Cube, your skill with the bow was amazing. I still remember the curve shot you showed during the festival.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything and just scratched my head. I was hoping she was panicking too much to have noticed, but it seemed that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha let out a low sigh.</p>
<p>“That bow you took out. I know what it is. No, even if it isn’t me, anyone decently skilled in the field of information would recognize Black Lotus’s bow.”</p>
<p>I just sat still. I was contemplating how to respond. Should I admit it or deny it? I couldn’t think of any excuse.</p>
<p>But, when I heard Yoo Yeonha’s next words…</p>
<p>“You’re willing to go that far to take revenge on the Chameleon Troupe?”</p>
<p>My head turned blank. It felt like my brain stopped functioning for a moment.</p>
<p>I had no other choice but to maintain my silence… and Yoo Yeonha continued talking.</p>
<p>“You’re willing to dirty your hands and hurt yourself to—”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha paused and looked at me. Her gaze was filled with sympathy and pity. I didn’t understand where they were coming from.</p>
<p>The only reaction I could give in response…</p>
<p>“….?”</p>
<p>…was to tilt my head.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 307. The Stories That Become Bridges (1)</p>
<p>Blood covered her entire body along with gooey flesh and hard pieces of skull. Cranial fluid splashed into her eyes and brain matter flew into her mouth.</p>
<p>The incident from a couple of hours ago was playing again in Yoo Yeonha’s head.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaak—!</em></p>
<p>An arrow had flown into the car before anyone could realize what was happening.</p>
<p>The driver’s head exploded like a balloon. The sickening stench, the sticky texture, the blood and the flesh… she felt disgusted by it all.</p>
<p>Even after emptying her stomach, she still felt sick. Death clung to her like a leech and she couldn’t fend it off.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>After tossing and turning in her nightmare, Yoo Yeonha opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Darkness filled her view and she was covered in sweat.</p>
<p>She felt nauseous.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha staggered to her feet and barely remained standing by holding onto the cave wall.</p>
<p>She threw up yet again.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha leaned against the wall and fell to the ground from sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p>What happened today left her with a trauma.</p>
<p>Death was much more horrific than she expected, especially up close.</p>
<p>She thought she would be indifferent, she believed she had become tough. Yet…</p>
<p>‘Is it because I stayed clear of real battles for too long, or is it because I’m too young?’</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clenched her teeth, blaming herself.</p>
<p>She recalled Licros.</p>
<p>She had personally selected him as an agent of Falling Blossom. The brave Mexican, who volunteered to be the spy, was also a husband and a father of two. But today, he disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was the one who burned his body.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Her selfishness was the reason for his death.</p>
<p>Deep in sorrow, Yoo Yeonha vowed to forever remember him and to always help out his family.</p>
<p>She wiped her tears and looked around.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin was nowhere to be found even though she remembered he was by her side when she fell asleep.</p>
<p>“Where did he go now…?”</p>
<p>Fear struck Yoo Yeonha, and she turned her smartwatch on instinctively.</p>
<p>[T-The number you have c-called cannot be reached at t-this time—]</p>
<p>But her broken smartwatch was still not working. Left with no other choice, Yoo Yeonha walked up to the mouth of the cave. She didn’t want to be alone inside.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>With a whip in hand, Yoo Yeonha cautiously approached the cave's exit, then suddenly let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin was sitting by the entrance of the cave. He must have been standing guard but ended up falling asleep.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha put the whip down with a smile, and she slunk towards Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seeing him asleep made her remember the horrific dream once again. In it, Kim Hajin was holding Black Lotus’s bow and arrows.</p>
<p>She muttered in pity, “You poor thing….”</p>
<p>Just how much weight was he carrying?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha couldn’t even imagine the pain and the pressure he had to bear.</p>
<p>Though Kim Hajin refused to comment, she was sure that he became a member of the Chameleon Troupe to seek revenge against them. Kim Hajin had walked into the mouth of the monster in order to earn its trust and bring it down for good, even if meant he had to get his own hands dirty.</p>
<p>“…He who fights with monsters must take care, lest he thereby becomes a monster himself.”</p>
<p>‘If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss gazes back into you….’</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha recalled the famous quote by Friedrich Nietzsche. It made her heart heavier.</p>
<p>Slowly, Yoo Yeonha stretched her arm and smoothed Kim Hajin’s ruffled hair. He looked like a child in his sleep, which made him look all the more pitiful.</p>
<p>‘A person can’t bear that much weight alone. You can ask your friends for help, so why won’t you?’</p>
<p>“….” Yoo Yeonha sat next to Kim Hajin in silence. Was it because of the heat from Kim Hajin’s clothes? The ground and the air around him was warm.</p>
<p>“…Haam~”</p>
<p>The warmth was making her feel sleepy again. This time, she was positive she wouldn’t have a nightmare.</p>
<p>“Uhm…. Ahmm….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha slowly dozed off. She slouched, leaning against Kim Hajin’s shoulder. His firm shoulder was her pillow that served as a gateway to a pleasant dream.</p>
<p>…5 minutes later.</p>
<p>The moon shone into the cave filled with silence and wind.</p>
<p>Under the dim moonlight, Kim Hajin was wide awake. He stared at Yoo Yeonha who was leaning against his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Why does she always misunderstand things?” Kim Hajin grumbled but couldn’t deny that her sleeping face was quite adorable.</p>
<p>He covered Yoo Yeonha with a blanket made from Aether. Wrapped in warmth, Yoo Yeonha sunk into a deep sleep. Away from nightmares, she smiled.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>A new day dawned and the morning sun rose.</p>
<p>Sannuri brought Jin Seyeon and Jin Sechan back. Judging by their appearances, I could only imagine the kind of hardship they experienced since we parted ways yesterday. We celebrated our reunion with a simple hug.</p>
<p>“We were ambushed by an archer. We managed to escape but our car was destroyed and we were chased by the Djinns.”</p>
<p>“…You too?”</p>
<p>I learned a new fact. I wasn’t the only one attacked by Leraje. She attacked me and Jin Seyeon at the same time. She was truly impressive.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>United once again, we began the strategy meeting. Our goal was to return safely.</p>
<p>We knew that we couldn’t rely on the Association for reinforcements. Fortunately, we had our own means of transportation, ‘Sannuri’.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the meeting was already decided.</p>
<p>However, Sannuri hated being around the [Dimensional Entropy]. So I cut down trees and sharpened stones to make a carriage. Thankfully, Sannuri didn’t mind pulling a carriage.</p>
<p>“Hop inside.”</p>
<p>I led others to the carriage I made. I had only invested 3 hours into making it, but it was sturdy and spacious enough for 4 people, all thanks to [Young Dwarf’s Dexterity].</p>
<p>“It’s surprisingly cozy in here.”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha and Jin Seyeon exclaimed in surprise, but I still had more to show. I put my hand on the carriage and activated [Random Consolidation System].</p>
<p>The number 60 appeared on the carriage.</p>
<p>Soon, the carriage became bigger, lighter, and better in terms of design. The concept of ‘carriage’ was enhanced by 60% exactly. The inside of the carriage was now big enough for 4 people to lie down.</p>
<p>“Enchant.”</p>
<p>Lastly, I activated [Four-colored Enchant].</p>
<p>“Black, Flow Isolation.”</p>
<p>I muttered the keywords. Immediately, Stigma seeped into the carriage, blending it in with the surroundings. This enchantment was used for [concealment].</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I climbed into the carriage. The trio stared at me in awe before climbing in as well.</p>
<p>After all passengers embarked, Sannuri started moving.</p>
<p>I stared outside, preparing for a possible ambush.</p>
<p>“…I’m glad I chose you to be my bodyguard.”</p>
<p>I simply smiled at Yoo Yeonha’s compliment. I still felt a little bit awkward around her because of her misunderstanding from the day before.</p>
<p>Sannuri raced across the grasslands of Central Asia. She was running at about 400 kilometers per hour, and the view outside the carriage window was changing at an equally quick pace. Our destination was Pyeongan Island in Korea. At our current speed, we should arrive in two days.</p>
<p>…I suddenly recalled the cold yet beautiful voice.</p>
<p>—My name.</p>
<p>That was what Leraje muttered as she stared at me. I looked at the information I got through [Narrow Escape from Death].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Leraje] [Current Power 9.3 / Potential 9.85]</p>
<p>—Rank 14 Devil</p>
<p>—Invasion Alignment - Neutral &amp; Moderate</p>
<p>—Has taken an interest in you.</p>
<p>—Likes archers like herself.</p>
<p>—Loves board games such as chess….</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Some of them were settings I came up with and some weren’t. I carefully went over the list.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>[Sorry, I turned my smartwatch off during training. I just saw your text.]</p>
<p>Suddenly, I received a text from Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Seoul, Korea — Hero Plaza]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk returned to Seoul. No one was by her side. She was visiting the ‘Hero Plaza’ alone.</p>
<p>The Hero Plaza was a large domed stadium located in the heart of Seoul. It was used by Heroes for ‘Ranking Battles’ or ‘Grade Promotion Battles’. Currently, the stadium, which could accommodate a total of 60,000 people, was crawling with Heroes, their managers, and reporters.</p>
<p>—We’ll now start the second preliminary round for the ‘Gate of Glory’!</p>
<p>Only the winners of this tournament would be allowed to enter the ‘Gate of Glory’, formerly called the ‘Demon Realm Gate’.</p>
<p>The Association avoided any mention of the horrors and deaths that lay in wait beyond the Gate and only publicized wealth and fame.</p>
<p>It was a very Association-like way of dealing with the issue.</p>
<p>—A total of 10,000 candidates currently remain in the race. Today, 1000 of the 10,000 candidates will be handpicked by the judges and 500 of the 1000 will advance to the next round!</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked down at the stadium filled with hopeful Heroes. Among the candidates were Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Bell, and Rumi.</p>
<p>The task of the second round was to complete a maze. Two Heroes were paired at random and the two had to get through a gigantic maze built in the basement of the stadium.</p>
<p>“Haa.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk let out a deep sigh. The cause of her concern was not the maze but something else.</p>
<p>“…I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>With another sigh, Jin Sahyuk took out the magnifying glass from her pocket. The glass part of it had shattered and only the frame remained. But Jin Sahyuk still remembered the words that had appeared on the glass. Those words represented Kim Hajin’s true feelings.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She waved the frame of the magnifying glass from side to side as she recalled Kim Hajin’s emotions.</p>
<p>[Pity]</p>
<p>The first was ‘pity’.</p>
<p>If that was all there was, she simply would’ve been mad at the fact that he took pity on her.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>[Sympathy] [Mild animosity]</p>
<p>The next were ‘sympathy’ and ‘animosity’. The two words seemed to contradict each other, but those weren’t too confusing either.</p>
<p>What truly baffled her were the countless words that suddenly filled her view afterward.</p>
<p>They overflowed and shattered the magnifying glass.</p>
<p>They instilled chaos in Jin Sahyuk’s heart.</p>
<p>—Emotions that will be 'synchronized' when the Synchronization rate increases (currently 15%)—</p>
<p>[Loyalty] [Faith] [Reason for living] [Happiness] [Sense of guilt for not being able to help] [Desire to be together] [Desire to protect]….</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand the source of the emotions that filled the magnifying glass and was even more clueless about the word ‘Synchronization’.</p>
<p>‘What in the world is Synchronization?’</p>
<p>‘What happens when it increases?’</p>
<p>‘And how do I increase it?’</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was completely confused.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sighed and looked below.</p>
<p>As she glanced over the arena full of Heroes, she met a man’s eye. He had a handsome face and brown hair.</p>
<p>It was Kim Suho.</p>
<p>The moment their eyes met, Kim Suho’s face stiffened. He then hurried to the stairs.</p>
<p><em>Tong— Tong— Tong—</em></p>
<p>The hollow sound of iron stairs rang out. Kim Suho made it to the end of the staircase in no time and stood next to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Are you here as a candidate?”</p>
<p>With a nod, Jin Sahyuk answered, “I don’t want to miss out on the fun. Isn’t it obvious? Idiot.”</p>
<p>Despite her insult, Kim Suho only smiled.</p>
<p>“You should stop here if you plan on doing anything rash inside. You know this is important.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s face distorted into a frown.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are to order me around?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked at Jin Sahyuk in silence. Jin Sahyuk, too, glared at Kim Suho.</p>
<p>For a minute, they only stared at each other.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kim Suho smiled and remarked playfully, “Or else, I’ll tell Hajin.”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s face stiffened.</p>
<p>“Mm? So I guess you don’t want Hajin to get mad at you.”</p>
<p>“I dare you to say that again, you bastard!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was angry. No, not angry. She was actually flustered.</p>
<p>‘Did Kim Hajin tell Kim Suho? Does he know about the things on the magnifying glass?’</p>
<p>“I’m just kidding.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shook his head, but Jin Sahyuk was still suspicious of him.</p>
<p>She glared at Kim Suho with flames in her eyes.</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, she had run out of time to interrogate.</p>
<p>—Next up is the candidate you’ve all been waiting for~ Swordsman of Wish Kim Suho! He turned down a special offer from the Association and chose to participate in the preliminary rounds! Kim Suho will participate in this mission with intermediate-rank Hero, Yi Yijin!</p>
<p>The host declared Kim Suho’s turn.</p>
<p>“I have to go now. Try not to cause a commotion, okay?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho gave a small smile and left. Jin Sahyuk continued to glare at him.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk noticed that someone was staring at her as she stared at Kim Suho. It was Chae Nayun. The mere sight of her annoyed Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>But the moment their eyes met— Jin Sahyuk remembered something Bell had said in the past.</p>
<p>‘Aren’t you curious about the relationship between Chae Nayun and Kim Hajin? I assure you it’s much more scandalous than you think.’</p>
<p>Maybe the whole synchronization thing was somehow related to this. Yes, Bell was an asshole, but he was a truthful asshole.</p>
<p>When her thoughts reached that far, Jin Sahyuk glared at Chae Nayun and activated ‘Reality Manipulation’. Jin Sahyuk’s magic power slipped into reality and altered it ever so slightly.</p>
<p>Now, the next team would be— Chae Nayun and Jin Sahyuk.</p>

<p>Jin Seyeon looked out the carriage window. The steppes of Central Asia looked different than what she saw on textbooks. Weeds grew to knee-length, trees stood tall reaching towards the sky, and there were even villages formed by small Djinn groups.</p>
<p>“…It feels like I’m in a fantasy world.” Jin Seyeon muttered in a daze.</p>
<p>In response, Jin Sechan also looked out the carriage. But because his eyesight wasn’t as inhumane as the others, he couldn’t see the same scenery as Jin Seyeon. So, he turned his sight back to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was staring at the tilionium case she was holding in her arms. She seemed to be deep in thought. Jin Sechan was worried about her but couldn’t bring himself to say anything. In his mind, his only role as her secretary was to watch her from the sidelines.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Jin Seyeon asked what he wanted to. Jin Seyeon smiled at Jin Sechan before moving over to the seat next to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha glanced at Jin Seyeon, then said with a nod, “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“Don’t keep that case too close to your body. It will have bad effects. If you want, it’s not too late to call demon merchants.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yoo Yeonha smiled bitterly. The group had already considered calling demon merchants, who would do anything for the right amount of DP.</p>
<p>“…No, demon merchants are demons also. They’ll desire this as well.”</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha didn’t trust them. There was no guarantee that demon merchants wouldn’t want something that other demons were desperate to get.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha let out a deep sigh and looked at the case holding the [Dimensional Entropy].</p>
<p>“Is that item that important?” Jin Seyeon asked.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded her head and replied without a moment of hesitation, “Yes, I know from the Skills I obtained from the Tower of Wish. [Basic Skill - Lv.9 Law of Thoughts], which amplifies the speed and strength of my thinking, and [Special Skill - Lv.9 Appraisal Eyes], which lets me appraise an item in my field of vision.”</p>
<p>Analysis of [Dimensional Entropy] was still happening inside Yoo Yeonha’s head. Essential Dynamics was also the best in the world at extracting magic power from crystals and mana stones.</p>
<p>“This item can save the lives of countless people.”</p>
<p>“….” Jin Seyeon looked at her for a moment, then smiled and said, “I hope so too.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled back at her feebly.</p>
<p>“Hmm….” On the other hand, Kim Hajin, who was watching the two from nearby, couldn’t understand the bond between them. As far as he was aware, there shouldn’t be any connection between the two. Just when did they develop such a sister-like relationship?</p>
<p>“…How did you two get so close?” Kim Hajin asked, unable to hold back his curiosity.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha and Jin Seyeon glanced at Kim Hajin, but both leaned against the carriage without saying anything.</p>
<p>“What the…” Kim Hajin pouted and furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha found this side of him cute. “I’ll tell you later.”</p>
<p>“…Tsk.” Kim Hajin nodded unhappily, then in the next moment, his eyes widened. He suddenly began to scan the air with his eyes.</p>
<p>[Where are you? I’m taking the test for the Gate of Glory.]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun had messaged him. Kim Hajin smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>[I can’t tell you that.]</p>
<p>[What? Why not? …Actually, that’s probably for the best.]</p>
<p>[Huh?]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun gave up surprisingly quickly. Kim Hajin tilted his head.</p>
<p>[I don’t think I’ll be able to talk if you’re in front of me. I’m not ready yet… you know what I mean?]</p>
<p>‘Heh.’ Kim Hajin smirked.</p>
<p>[Yeah, I guess it’s still a bit awkward. So?]</p>
<p>[Right, so… I was thinking we could just talk a couple of times a day with this. So that we can get familiar with talking to each other. We can also play games. Did you know there’s a new version of Gladiator of the Century?]</p>
<p>[No.]</p>
<p>[Download it. It’s popular among Heroes because it helps with image training. They added a bunch of skills, so it’s super popular. Tournaments regularly get over 900,000 viewers….]</p>
<p>As expected of a known gamer, Chae Nayun began to talk about recent news. Kim Hajin just listened to her with a smile on his face, while Jin Seyeon and Yoo Yeonha stared at him like he had gone mad.</p>
<p>[Ah, wait, the heck, I’m paired up with Jin Sahyuk.]</p>
<p>[What? Jin Sahyuk?]</p>
<p>[Yeah, I’m hanging up for now.]</p>
<p>“What are you doing by yourself?” As soon as Chae Nayun cut off the communication, Yoo Yeonha asked. It was then.</p>
<p>“…!” Kim Hajin’s expression stiffened. It wasn’t just him, Jin Seyeon was the same. With their supernatural perception, the two of them had sensed someone’s ‘gaze’.</p>
<p>An outsider was watching them from afar.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin and Jin Seyeon exchanged glances silently. Soon, Jin Seyeon’s Mental Transmission rang out inside Kim Hajin’s head.</p>
<p>—We should just let this person keep watching. I don’t know who it is, but I don’t sense any hostility. We should act normal.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin nodded his head.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon smiled brightly and said, “By the way, everyone’s raising a ‘sponsored character’ with DP, right?”</p>
<p>The DP System was granted to anyone who hunted demonic monsters even once. Those who earned more than 50,000 DP could play something called the ‘minigame’. Sponsoring the people of Lailos was growing in popularity.</p>
<p>“Of course, you’ll be surprised to know who I’m sponsoring.” Yoo Yeonha said proudly.</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Show me.”</p>
<p>With a grin, Yoo Yeonha displayed the information of the individual she was sponsoring. It was a high-rank knight named Gimitos.</p>
<p>“Wow, Gimitos the Berserker! He was yours? The Lailos Community was full of comments praising him.”</p>
<p>“…Lailos what?” Kim Hajin asked in surprise. Though he wasn’t aware, an online community had developed for Lailos sponsors. The site already had more than 200,000 members.</p>
<p>“There’s a post every time Gimitos buys a new armor or weapon. Didn’t he buy the Black Flame Dragon Armor recently?”</p>
<p>“…Well, I don’t want to brag. So, what about you?” Yoo Yeonha shrugged her shoulders and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“I’m raising an archer. Look.”</p>
<p>The Lailosian Jin Seyeon was sponsoring was an intermediate-rank archer named Lekio. Yoo Yeonha and Jin Sechan looked at him with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>“That bow looks like it’s made with emetos ore. Ah, his armor is made with quality leather as well…”</p>
<p>While the three of them talked, Kim Hajin checked up on his retainer, Litrain.</p>
<p>「Litrain became the youngest Master-rank knight, obtaining the title, Starlight Knight.</p>
<p>Even after rising to the position of a knight order commander, she didn’t stop training. The once small ‘Extra Temple’ now had over a thousand visitors per day. Serving under her were dozens of apprentice knights who were drawn by her charisma.</p>
<p>An order of knights called the Starlight Knights was created inside the existing knight order of the kingdom, making Litrain’s influence one of the strongest in the kingdom.</p>
<p>However, Litrain was still worried about one thing. Recently, her disciples and the followers of the Extra Temple were growing suspicious of Extra-nim. They knew that over a year had passed since he last sponsored Litrain…」</p>
<p>Litrain had grown tremendously since the last time Kim Hajin saw her. He had earned over 200,000 DP from her, a third of which he immediately sent back to Litrain.</p>
<p>“Who are you sponsoring, Hajin-ssi? Show us.” Jin Seyeon asked at that moment.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin hesitated for a moment. “…Well, it’s her.”</p>
<p>He displayed Litrain’s information rather casually. But everyone else immediately dropped their jaws.</p>
<p>“Wait, Litrain… she’s famous in the community… My Gimitos….”</p>
<p>Soon, Yoo Yeonha’s jealous voice rang out.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, Leraje was watching them from a distance. As seeing far was her specialty, she didn’t have any trouble following their movements. She stared at the man named Kim Hajin carefully.</p>
<p>He knew her name, and he didn’t mutter it thoughtlessly. Leraje had the ability to discern what state someone was in based on their voice.</p>
<p>“What are you up to, Duchess?”</p>
<p>At that moment, her henchman, Corte, asked her. Leraje replied simply.</p>
<p>—Bored.</p>
<p>—Being here alone is boring.</p>
<p>—Did you get in touch with those old devils?</p>
<p>“Yes, three devils obtained incarnation bodies. Rank 3 Devil, Prince Vassago, Rank 29 Devil, Count Astaroth, and Rank 62 Devil, Valac.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Leraje immediately frowned.</p>
<p>—Old Man hasn’t escaped his curse yet?</p>
<p>Old Man. She was referring to Baal.</p>
<p>Corte smiled and shook his head, “No, King Baal has escaped the curse. The Gate of the Demon Realm will soon open, so his descent is not far away.”</p>
<p>—How long will it take?</p>
<p>“Three months and not a day more.”</p>
<p>Three months. It was too long for Leraje. If she became too bored, she might wander around the outside world. Corte wanted to avoid risking her identity as much as possible.</p>
<p>To do this, Corte took out an electronic device he had brought beforehand.</p>
<p>—What’s that?</p>
<p>“It’s called a game console. Humans like to play it to entertain themselves. With this, you will never be bored.”</p>
<p>—…Is that so?</p>
<p>Leraje showed interest. It was a good sign. Corte knelt down and offered the virtual reality gaming console to Leraje.</p>
<p>—How do I use it?</p>
<p>“You just have to wear the helmet and turn the game on by moving your fingers.”</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Leraje did as Corte suggested. Her vision turned black for a moment, then a blue screen popped up in front of her. At the same time, a strange sensation of being transported to another world encompassed her.</p>
<p>[I will explain how to use this console. Please do as I say.]</p>
<p>Before she could get used to the sensation, a message popped up in front of her, and Leraje furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>—Who are you to tell me what to do?</p>
<p>[Try moving your fingers.]</p>
<p>—I don’t want to. Introduce yourself first.</p>
<p>[Try moving your fingers.]</p>
<p>—Impudent.</p>
<p>Leraje moved her fingers, her intent being to destroy the impudent being talking to her. But the moment she moved her fingers, the world changed. The blue room she was in transformed into a vast grassland.</p>
<p>Leraje widened her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>[Here is a list of popular games. Click on the one you want to play.]</p>
<p>[1. Gladiator of the Century]</p>
<p>[2. Reolesk]</p>
<p>[3. Grand Theft Auto]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Leraje stared at the messages before clicking on ‘Gladiator of the Century’.</p>
<p>[You already own the game. Accessing ‘Gladiator of the Century’…]</p>
<p>[Welcome to the world of Gladiator of the Century.]</p>
<p>[Please set your ID.]</p>
<p>[Your ID will be your name inside Gladiator of the Century.]</p>
<p>—You’re kind unlike the one before.</p>
<p>Leraje nodded in satisfaction before writing down her ID.</p>
<p>[Lijengy]</p>
<p>Lijengy was purely a typo, but Leraje didn’t catch it in the slightest.</p>
<p>[Welcome, Lijengy.]</p>
<p>—What? Lijengy? You…</p>
<p>Having become Lijengy, Leraje expressed her anger at the machine for calling her the wrong name.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Next up, Essence of the Strait’s rising star, Chae Nayun, and the black horse of the tournament, Jin Sahyuk!]</p>
<p>Seoul’s Hero Plaza.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and Jin Sahyuk were placed in the same team, and the two of them entered the maze side by side.</p>
<p>“Screw off.”</p>
<p>Of course, Chae Nayun showed no intention of working together with her, bolting off to the opposite direction the moment they entered the maze.</p>
<p>Although running in a random direction wasn’t recommended inside a maze, Chae Nayun’s intuition gave her an undeniable edge. Chae Nayun knew about her supernatural intuition, so she believed she would find the exit before long.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk had no intention of letting that happen. She activated Reality Manipulation. Her magic power seeped into the maze and changed its structure.</p>
<p><em>Kiiik— Kiiik—</em></p>
<p>The change in the maze eliminated the exit altogether. Chae Nayun, who wasn’t unaware of the change, thought of the shifting maze as part of the trial.</p>
<p>“…She really is an idiot.” Jin Sahyuk sneered. Now, Chae Nayun wouldn’t be able to find the exit no matter what she did. All Jin Sahyuk had to do was wait until she grew tired and came back.</p>
<p><em>Plop—</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sat down on the floor and sent Mental Transmissions to Bell to pass time.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Central Asia]</p>
<p>The carriage continued to race through Central Asia as Jin Seyeon, Yoo Yeonha, and Jin Sechan kept their eyes glued to Litrain. They were fully watching her every move, exclaiming every once in a while about her beauty, strength, and kindness.</p>
<p>By the time they fell asleep, they had become avid fans of Litrain.</p>
<p>After sleeping for 3~4 hours, the carriage reached China. The safe zone wasn’t far away, but we kept our guard up.</p>
<p>“…The gaze went away.” Jin Seyeon said.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” I nodded my head.</p>
<p><em>Clack, clack.</em> The carriage moved peacefully. Then, I turned to Jin Seyeon. She was also looking at me. By the looks of it, she must have also felt the unusual presence approaching us.</p>
<p>“Yeonha-ssi, we should get ready for battle.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was startled by Jin Seyeon’s words, but she soon took out her whip courageously.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon said, “We’re surrounded. There’s no way to break through. Rather than being ambushed, we should go out and face them.”</p>
<p>“…I agree.”</p>
<p>It would be annoying if the carriage was destroyed by an ambush.</p>
<p>I opened the carriage door and walked outside. Jin Seyeon, Yoo Yeonha, and Jin Sechan followed suit.</p>
<p>In that instant, hostility and killing intent shot up. Wind carrying demonic energy blew over, and the enemy’s presence drew closer.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, we’ll win for sure. I’m a hundred percent certain.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon took out her bow as she calmed Yoo Yeonha. I also took out my Desert Eagle.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, demonic energy filled the air. A giant storm seemed to brew as a shooting star shot down from the sky.</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>The shooting star landed a little ways in front of us. Unsurprisingly, the shooting star was a living being.</p>
<p>“Haha, how are you all doing on this fine day?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I knew who he was. The mask covering half of his face made it obvious. It was Destruction.</p>
<p>But Destruction wasn’t the only enemy. Dozens of Djinns appeared from the ground, sky, and land and surrounded us.</p>
<p>“Uhahahaha.” Destruction burst out into laughter. Yoo Yeonha stared at Destruction and clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Yoo Jinwoong’s daughter.”</p>
<p>“…You know him?” Jin Seyeon asked.</p>
<p>“A little bit. He lost to my father back in the day.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“He went crazy from his inferiority complex and ended up losing half of his face to my father.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Destruction’s face contorted heavily. Seething in rage, he glared at Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“It seems the daughter is just as trashy as the father…”</p>
<p>Then, he took a step forward with a grin. The Djinns around the area all released their demonic energy and transformed into a devil-like form. Unsurprisingly, Destruction’s subordinates were all skilled with Devil Transformation.</p>
<p>Destruction asked, “Where’s the Dimensional Entropy? Inside the carriage? I’ll let you die peacefully if you hand it over.”</p>
<p>However, Yoo Yeonha shook her head.</p>
<p>Destruction furrowed his brows, “Trust me. If you hand over the Dimensional Entropy, I’ll chop off your heads cleanly and send you mostly intact to the father you love so much. Otherwise—”</p>
<p>“Shut it. Your breath is smelly.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Destruction’s expression turned ugly. I transformed the Desert Eagle into its machine gun form.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Destruction let out a deep sigh. Then, he scratched his head with his long nails, which began to turn black. Without a doubt, this partial change was also Devil Transformation.</p>
<p>“…Looks like I’ll have to go back on my words.”</p>
<p>A giant horn protruded out from his head, and his body began to turn black with demonic energy. Destruction bent his body like a track runner at the starting line, then shot forward like a bullet.</p>
<p>No, that’s what he tried to do.</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>A clear, child-like voice rang out from the sky. Shackles of magic power bound Destruction’s body.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Destruction. The entire world seemed to have responded to the voice as Destruction’s subordinates and even the blowing wind froze solid.</p>
<p>“Ku….uk.”</p>
<p>Destruction turned his head desperately to the direction the voice came from.</p>
<p>A ‘small person’ was floating 10 meters above the ground. Her symbolic white hair shone beautifully, and her proud, chic eyes glared at Destruction sharply.</p>
<p>The Hero who defined a generation had arrived.</p>
<p>“…Why did you come so late?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon looked up at her and smiled.</p>
<p>“I came as quickly as I could. You told me to come secretly. I’m the chairman of the Temple of Justice, you think it’s easy for me to leave work without anyone knowing?”</p>
<p>Aileen grumbled and hopped down from a puff of cloud she was standing on.</p>
<p><em>Tadat—</em></p>
<p>She landed lightly inside the area frozen in time by her single word.</p>
<p>“Looks at all the trash here.” She said with a sneer.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha finally snapped out of her daze and glanced at Jin Seyeon, asking for an explanation.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon smiled and whispered.</p>
<p>—I told you, we’re going to win for sure. I secretly asked for backup.</p>
<p>“Kuuu…uuuuk….”</p>
<p>Destruction resisted Aileen’s Spirit Speech as hard as he could. He twisted his neck forcefully and muttered with rage.</p>
<p>“You’re… Ai…”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth.”</p>
<p>Aileen’s words muted Destruction, but his eyes were still glaring at her with killing intent.</p>
<p>Aileen furrowed her brows</p>
<p>“…You’re annoying. Just get crushed!”</p>
<p>A short exclamation rang out in the empty field. And that was enough.</p>
<p>“Uk, uuuuuaak—!”</p>
<p>Destruction’s body folded on itself in a strange way before exploding.</p>
<p>…That was the end.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>We stared at the scene in a daze. Aileen had gotten far more powerful than when we saw her in the Tower of Wish, or even when we saw her during the fight against Orden.</p>
<p>She was almost at the level of a ‘transcendent’.</p>
<p>Just what happened?</p>
<p>“Pft, impressed? I got an amazing Unique Skill at the Tower of Wish. This is nothing to me now.”</p>
<p>Aileen strutted her chest and looked around. The leader of the Djinns were now dead, but the remaining ones couldn’t move because of Aileen’s Spirit Speech.</p>
<p>Aileen ignored them and approached Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>“Anyways, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Yes? Ah… about that.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon scratched the back of her neck for a bit, then placed her hand on Yoo Yeonha’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Let me introduce her first. This is Yoo Yeonha, the Chief Officer of the guild I’m in.”</p>
<p>“…Chief Officer? What do you mean, you’re not in a…”</p>
<p>In an instant, Aileen’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Wait, you mean…?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was the first to realize what Jin Seyeon meant.</p>
<p>“…Ah!”</p>
<p>This was Jin Seyeon’s response to the offer she made a long time ago. Yoo Yeonha looked at Jin Seyeon, then at Aileen, then at me.</p>
<p>“Y…Yes!”</p>
<p>Then, she jumped excitedly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 309. The Stories That Become Bridges (3)</p>
<p>[Seoul, Korea — Maze at the ‘Hero Plaza’]</p>
<p>After 3 hours, Chae Nayun realized something was wrong. Her intuition told her that this maze had no exit.</p>
<p>But how could that be the case? This test was designed to pick out 200 challengers for the Gate of Glory. Chae Nayun explored the maze for 2 more hours to reaffirm her doubt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jin Sahyuk grew more and more tiresome as she watched Chae Nayun go back and forth. She assumed Chae Nayun would give up soon enough, but clearly, she was wrong. Chae Nayun’s tenacity was beyond her imagination.</p>
<p>“Ehew.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk let out a sigh and got up, about to intervene in Chae Nayun's wandering.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>—Sahyuk.</p>
<p>She heard a voice. It flowed into her ears, freezing her brain. Jin Sahyuk widened her eyes and turned her gaze to where the voice had come from.</p>
<p>There, a semi-transparent, fog-like existence glimmered in the air. It was Bell, without a doubt.</p>
<p>“Bell, you bastard—”</p>
<p>Was it because they had been apart for too long? Jin Sahyuk jumped at Bell with a needlessly excessive amount of joy. She stretched her arm and grabbed Bell in his gaseous state by the collar. Bell smiled as he looked down at her grip.</p>
<p>“Where have you been—”</p>
<p>—Shh.</p>
<p>Bell put his finger to his lips.</p>
<p>“Shh? Are you crazy?”</p>
<p>—Hey, keep it down. I’m only here because it looked like you were gonna be eliminated from the tournament.</p>
<p>“Eliminated my ass….”</p>
<p>—You’ve accomplished nothing during the last 6 hours. Don’t you want to enter the Gate of the Demon Realm?</p>
<p>“…Is there a reason why I should enter?” Jin Sahyuk remarked flatly. She was here because she wanted to enter the Gate of the Demon Realm. She just felt the need to revolt because she was pissed at Bell.</p>
<p>Bell smiled, thinking Jin Sahyuk was cute.</p>
<p>—Of course you do. You have to kill me inside the Gate.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s face stiffened. But Bell looked as comfortable as he always did.</p>
<p>—I know you already heard most of what you needed to know from Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk remained silent. Bell was finally starting to take form.</p>
<p>Bell reached out towards Jin Sahyuk and put his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Please continue to work hard. I believe in you, Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Bell’s voice, now even clearer than before, danced in her ears.</p>
<p>“I’ve repeated the past countless times and finally found you….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked at Bell. She couldn’t understand the firm trust and the earnest hope lurking in his eyes.</p>
<p>“…My death.”</p>
<p>Bell put his hand on Jin Sahyuk’s head. He recalled the moment he first met Jin Sahyuk. Back then, she was so small that they couldn’t even see eye to eye even when Bell bent over. But now she was an adult.</p>
<p>“You can do it, right?”</p>
<p>A broad smile spread across Bell’s face.</p>
<p>Staring at the beaming smile, Jin Sahyuk nodded.</p>
<p>“…If that’s what you want, of course I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was full of confidence. Death seemed like a befitting gift for the frenemy she’d known for about 20 years.</p>
<p>“The end is finally near~”</p>
<p>“But,” Suddenly Jin Sahyuk gave a wry smile and said, “I have one condition.”</p>
<p>She had one last question, one last thing she needed to know before she killed Bell.</p>
<p>“Do you know what ‘Synchronization’ is?”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[East Asia]</p>
<p>Aileen didn’t ask much. She seemed confused as to why we couldn’t use portals or skills but still provided us top-grade protection.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can leave for this long?”</p>
<p>“I’ll take this as a vacation. I’ve been so busy recently that I was starting to get annoyed, honestly.”</p>
<p>Aileen shrugged at Jin Seyeon’s question.</p>
<p>“And this is the first time I’ve ever been in a carriage. Oh, right, what are you gonna do about the carriage? If you’re gonna throw it away, can I keep it?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, of course. You can keep it, Aileen-ssi.”</p>
<p>“Really?! Wow, thanks!”</p>
<p>Aileen beamed.</p>
<p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
<p>But the smile quickly faded and Aileen looked at me and Yoo Yeonha in her usual expression.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I won’t ask what you did. I’m sure you were careful not to get involved in anything illegal.”</p>
<p>“…Of course.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded and, all of a sudden, pointed outside the window.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s Pyeongan Island!”</p>
<p>We all sat up straight like meerkats.</p>
<p>As she said, I could see the Korean border in the distance. Yoo Yeonha didn’t care to hide her joy, and I sent a text to Boss with my smartwatch now that the reception was back.</p>
<p>—Boss, I’ve completed the mission.</p>
<p>The reply came quick.</p>
<p>—Good job. Rest well.</p>
<p>At that moment, <em>clunk—</em> The carriage stopped and Sannuri began to throw a tantrum. She was startled by the border guards coming at us with guns and swords in their hands.</p>
<p>“I’ll deal with them.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was the first to step out of the carriage.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Asked one of the guards. But when they saw Yoo Yeonha, all of them immediately gave a 90 degree bow and escorted us back to the mainland.</p>
<p>Later— Yoo Yeonha dragged me to ‘Essential Dynamics Non-Divisional Unit’ located in South Pyeongan Province.</p>
<p>The base was larger than most universities. Yoo Yeonha had been preparing this base ever since she first heard of [Dimensional Entropy].</p>
<p>“…This is where we’ll open the Dimensional Entropy.”</p>
<p>Right now, there were only four of us—Jin Seyeon, Jin Sechan, Yoo Yeonha, and me—here inside the enormous base.</p>
<p>“And, this is the ‘Celestial Extractor’— the culmination of magic engineering that will be used to activate Dimensional Entropy.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha walked towards a large machine with the tilionium case in her hands.</p>
<p>At the center of the machine was the ‘energy heart’, a place to lay down a crystal or a magic ore. Circular pieces of machinery were revolving around the heart. The whole picture reminded me of the Solar System.</p>
<p>We stared at the magnificent scenery in awe. Even Yoo Yeonha, the architect, seemed fascinated by the machine.</p>
<p>“…The energy extracted using this machine could be used for bullets, artillery shells, engines, barriers, power… everything. Essence of the Strait will take humanity to the next level. We’ll be able to stand against any and all possible threats from now on.”</p>
<p>The energy was glowing in green.</p>
<p>I stared some more at the miniature Solar System before turning around with a small smile. Yoo Yeonha looked at me, slightly confused.</p>
<p>“Are you leaving?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m busy.”</p>
<p>I had to deliver the last dress to Medea who was waiting for me in the Tower of Wish. I also had to visit Evandel as promised.</p>
<p>“…Sure. Thanks again for your hard work. You can always come back if anything happens-”</p>
<p>“Just remember to send me those shares,” I said and turned my gaze to Jin Seyeon and Jin Sechan, “Then, do you plan on joining the Essence of the Strait, Jin Seyeon-nim?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon gave a broad smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s finally time for me to start considering politics.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I smiled in silence.</p>
<p>Next up was Jin Sechan, but I didn’t have much to say to him. But when he noticed that I was looking at him, he bowed to me first.</p>
<p>“It was all thanks to you that I survived. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“…N-No. Thank you for your hard work.”</p>
<p>With that, the mission ended for good.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving now. Take care.”</p>
<p>“Yes, see you later.”</p>
<p>I said goodbye to Yoo Yeonha and left the base.</p>
<p>Then, I immediately headed to ‘Evandel’s Forest’ with Spartan who had completely healed.</p>
<p>[♥ Evandel &amp; Hayang’s Cabin ^-^ ★]</p>
<p>One word had been added to the adorable door plate.</p>
<p>I opened the door to the cabin without even knocking.</p>
<p>“Evandel~”</p>
<p>Evandel, who had been playing house with Hayang in the living room, widened her eyes. She looked at me in a daze and suddenly dropped the doll she had in her hand on the floor. And….</p>
<p>“Hajin—!”</p>
<p>…With a radiant smile, she jumped into my arms.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>11 PM.</p>
<p>I lay in bed with Evandel as I surfed the web.</p>
<p>[The second preliminary round for the Gate of Glory has ended.]</p>
<p>[What lies beyond the Gate of Glory?]</p>
<p>[‘The Road Ahead for Korea’, Chae Joochul’s speech receives a standing ovation….]</p>
<p>The Internet was filled with news regarding the ‘Gate of Glory’. There was excitement but no panic, probably because the Association changed the name of the gate from the ‘Gate of the Demon Realm’ to the ‘Gate of Glory’.</p>
<p>“…Mm?”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I saw the virtual reality helmet lying on the floor of the room. I had brought it with me because I thought Evandel might take an interest in it.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>Evandel was asleep and I was bored.</p>
<p>I stretched my arm and grabbed the helmet.</p>
<p>“Scan.”</p>
<p>Scan was a must. I put the helmet on after I checked it had been enhanced by 59%.</p>
<p><em>Jiing—</em></p>
<p>The boot-up usually took about 2 minutes, but with the enhancement, it only took 10 seconds. I looked over the list of games.</p>
<p>[Popular Games]</p>
<p>[1. Gladiator of the Century]</p>
<p>[2. Reolesk]</p>
<p>[3. Grand Theft Auto]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>‘Gladiator of the Century’ certainly caught my eye. Chae Nayun had asked me to play it with her before, so I figured I should get some practice.</p>
<p>[Purchasing ‘Gladiator of the Century’…. Purchase complete.]</p>
<p>[Accessing ‘Gladiator of the Century’….]</p>
<p>[Welcome to the world of ‘Gladiator of the Century’.]</p>
<p>[Please set your ID.]</p>
<p>My username was always a given.</p>
<p>Extra 7.</p>
<p>[Your username is ‘Extra 7’.]</p>
<p>[Welcome. Would you like to view the tutorial?]</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>I skipped the tutorial.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was look at the [Current Rankings] list. Games were always more fun when you played with someone good.</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>[Current Rankings]</p>
<p>1 — Fralo 161 matches, 130 wins, 31 losses</p>
<p>2 — BritishSpirit 146 matches, 121 wins, 25 losses</p>
<p>3 — Lijengy 70 matches, 70 wins</p>
<p>4 — Wolf 150 matches, 103 wins, 47 losses</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>“Let’s see….”</p>
<p>First, I sent a goodwill match request to the No.1 player.</p>
<p>[Failed to send a goodwill match request to ‘Fralo’. This user has chosen to decline goodwill match requests from strangers.]</p>
<p>“Ah, right.”</p>
<p>Most rankers chose to decline match requests from players other than their friends. This was the case for other games as well. If they didn’t, newbies would pester them continuously.</p>
<p>‘Should I just play ranked games?’ I thought when I noticed ‘Lijengy’. She was the only ranker who didn’t have the [Automatically Decline Goodwill Match Request] option turned on.</p>
<p>“70 matches and 70 wins….”</p>
<p>She looked strong.</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, I sent the request.</p>
<p>[You have sent a goodwill match request to ‘Lijengy’.]</p>
<p>[…‘Lijengy’ has accepted your goodwill match request.]</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>The moment Lijengy accepted my request, my body was transferred to an arena.</p>
<p>[Map - Gladiator’s Colosseum]</p>
<p>Dust and the cries of the crowd filled the arena.</p>
<p>My opponent was standing on the other side of the Colosseum.</p>
<p>The sword she was holding was so strangely short that it almost looked like a dagger.</p>
<p>After some thought, I chose a baseball bat as my weapon.</p>
<p>[You have chosen ‘baseball bat’, a beginner’s weapon.]</p>
<p>[3, 2, 1]</p>
<p>[Begin!]</p>
<p>The duel began.</p>
<p><em>Taat—!</em></p>
<p>I ran towards ‘Lijengy’ with the baseball bat in my hand. I swung it at her as hard as I could.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>Lijengy tried to evade my attack, but I relentlessly swung my bat at her.</p>
<p>—Quadruple Baseball Bat Swing!</p>
<p>I shouted.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh— Whoosh— Whoosh— Whoosh—</em></p>
<p>My bat moved back and forth 4 times.</p>
<p>And that was the end.</p>
<p>—Kyaaak!</p>
<p>Lijengy died, not being able to withstand my attack.</p>
<p>“…What the.”</p>
<p>It made sense once I thought about it. My console had been enhanced by an astounding 59%, so my character was alone in an accelerated world. I was basically using a speed hack.</p>
<p>“This is bad.”</p>
<p>‘I should probably turn off [Random Consolidation System]. It trivializes the entire game…’</p>
<p>As I was about to turn the game off….</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a rematch.]</p>
<p>…I received a match request from Lijengy.</p>
<p>I accepted it, but the result was the same.</p>
<p>—Quintuple Baseball Bat Swing!</p>
<p>—Kyaak!</p>
<p>[K.O.]</p>
<p>[Winner - ‘Extra 7’]</p>
<p>Again, the match ended in less than 3 minutes.</p>
<p>But Lijengy was persistent.</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a best of three rematch.]</p>
<p>“…Someone’s competitive.”</p>
<p>I accepted her request.</p>
<p>I was transferred to the Colosseum again.</p>
<p>I jumped at her and swung my baseball bat.</p>
<p>Lijengy fell, but she immediately asked for a rematch.</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a best of three rematch.]</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a best of three rematch.]</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a best of five rematch.]</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a best of five rematch.]</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a best of seven….]</p>
<p>I was still invincible after 50 rounds and Lijengy continued to send me rematch requests.</p>
<p>[‘Lijengy’ has requested you for a best of nine rematch.]</p>
<p>“Let’s not….”</p>
<p>‘Best of nine is just excessive,’ I thought, when I received a text from Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>[Kim Hajin, where are you? Let’s meet.]</p>
<p>I declined the rematch request and typed a reply to Jin Sahyuk’s text.</p>
<p>[You have declined Lijengy’s match request.]</p>
<p>[Lijengy has sent you a message.]</p>
<p>“…What’s wrong with her?”</p>
<p>[Why did you decline my request, Extra 7?]</p>
<p>[You’re the strongest human I’ve ever met.]</p>
<p>[Accept my request.]</p>
<p>[Don’t decline my request.]</p>
<p>“Is she crazy?”</p>
<p>[Accept my request right this moment. I haven’t lost completely yet.]</p>
<p>[Answer me. Don’t test my patience.]</p>
<p>[Don’t make me wait.]</p>
<p>I took off the helmet without replying.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>I received a ‘signal’ from the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>It came from [Tomer’s Crystal Ball] that I had put inside my Stigma.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Tower of Wish — 8F Crevon]</p>
<p>After I spent some time with Evandel, I returned to Crevon with Jin Sahyuk who had contacted me yesterday.</p>
<p>“Why did we come here again?” Jin Sahyuk asked me, walking down the hallway of Tomer’s mansion.</p>
<p>“I think Tomer wants to talk to me about something.”</p>
<p>And while I was here, I planned to deliver the finished robe to Medea.</p>
<p>“…Ah, why did you text me yesterday?” I asked back.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk leered at me and said, “You said you’d stay by my side for half a year. It hasn’t been half a year yet.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah?”</p>
<p>Startled by the fact that Jin Sahyuk had been keeping track, I quickened my pace and arrived at Tomer’s office.</p>
<p><em>Tok, Tok—</em></p>
<p>Tomer answered as soon as I knocked.</p>
<p>—Come in.</p>
<p>I opened the door and went in.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em> With a screeching sound, the wooden door swung open.</p>
<p>Tomer was sitting in a chair, all alone in an office that was more modest than I remembered.</p>
<p>“Welc- Oh? Well, if it isn’t the former Knight Commander!”</p>
<p>“She’s with me. Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Sit down,” Tomer said and pointed at a chair.</p>
<p>I sat down.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“So- what?”</p>
<p>“…Why did you call me?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Tomer’s face stiffened at my question. She looked at me then Jin Sahyuk and said in a low voice, “I wanted to speak to you about Descent, and also about the prophecy.”</p>
<p>“…Prophecy?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It comes from the administrator of Crevon….”</p>
<p>Tomer showed me a piece of paper. There were only two sentences written across it.</p>
<p>[An enormous calamity shall descend upon the outside world.]</p>
<p>[The inside and the outside must unite as one in order to overcome this ordeal.]</p>
<p>I widened my eyes. The tip of Tomer’s mouth slanted upward.</p>
<p>“The queen wants to speak to you… about the prophecy.”</p>
<p>“Queen? You mean Araha?”</p>
<p>“…Hey, watch your mouth.”</p>
<p>Tomer frowned.</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly and restructured my question.</p>
<p>“What does Her Majesty wish to speak to me about?”</p>
<p>“The second sentence sounds tricky. The part where it says ‘the inside and the outside must unite as one.’”</p>
<p>The inside and the outside must unite as one. It was a very simple sentence, and an idea naturally crossed my mind.</p>
<p>‘Temporary Descent of everyone from the Tower of Wish to fight against the devil and the Demon Realm Transformation.’</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I get that, but why did the queen pick me? I’m not really famous here.”</p>
<p>“How should I know? But listen to me carefully. Araha is a tyrant.”</p>
<p>“Araha? Are you sure you can call the queen by her name?”</p>
<p>“I’m allowed,” Tomer replied and took out a pen, “Now, listen carefully, because I’m about to tell you the dos and don'ts….”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 310. The Stories That Become Bridges (4)</p>
<p>“Araha hates black clothes. She also hates arrogant people and hates being ignored even more. She has an inferiority complex because she wasn’t the first-in-line to become the king.</p>
<p>“The reason Araha is calling you should have something to do with Prestige. You’re Prestige’s master after all.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what Araha thinks about the prophecy. I assume it’s a mix of interest and displeasure….”</p>
<p>After receiving Tomer’s advice, we went to the royal palace, which was several times bigger and grander than the last time I had seen it.</p>
<p>“…By the way, Jin Sahyuk, did I kill you once or twice?” Before going in, I asked Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Her pride seemed to have been hurt as she frowned without a reply.</p>
<p>“I’m not making fun of you. I’m asking how many Skill slots you have left.”</p>
<p>“…Five.”</p>
<p>“Five? Three basic and 2 special? You didn’t learn any?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk nodded her head.</p>
<p>“You’re more prudent than I thought. Well, you’ll be learning some today.”</p>
<p>The royal palace should have a few buff-type passive skills. I would be surprised if the royal palace’s vault had nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t need any.” But to my surprise, Jin Sahyuk shook her head and grumbled. “I can’t learn Ultimate Skills and Unique Skills because of you. I don’t need other trash skills.”</p>
<p>“What? No.”</p>
<p>Now that Jin Sahyuk was becoming more and more redeemable, it was important for me to strengthen her.</p>
<p>“Synthesized Basic Skills and Special Skills that take up two slots are worth learning. We’ll have to look through the vault to see what’s available though.”</p>
<p>“…The hell does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine if you don’t understand. Let’s just go in.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk and I entered the palace. Once we showed our royal invitation letter to a guard, a knight came down to greet us.</p>
<p>“My name is Wilhelm Tell. Follow me, Her Royal Highness is waiting.”</p>
<p>Wilhelm Tell. He wasn’t all that famous in modern Earth, but his story remained as a small legend.</p>
<p>We followed Wilhelm past a huge garden. Countless knights were lined up along the hallway we walked through. I wasn’t sure if they were there to greet us or threaten us.</p>
<p>“Go in.”</p>
<p>Eventually, we arrived in front of a well-decorated door.</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>I turned the doorknob and slowly pushed the door in.</p>
<p>The door opened smoothly, and I could see Araha sitting at the head of a long, rectangular table.</p>
<p>Once the door fully opened, Araha smiled. Standing next to her were Lancelot and Lü Bu.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Master of Prestige and Former Knight Commander Shin Jahyuk,” Araha said.</p>
<p>“…We’re humbled to be in your audience.”</p>
<p>I greeted her the way I learned from Tomer. Jin Sahyuk, on the other hand, simply nodded her head. It seemed to be a matter of pride. After all, she was a former king.</p>
<p>“I see you haven’t changed, Knight Commander. Please sit.”</p>
<p>Araha didn’t seem to mind Jin Sahyuk’s attitude as she guided us to our seats. I tilted my head at Araha’s reaction. The impression I was getting from her was different than what Tomer taught me.</p>
<p>“Hajin-ssi?”</p>
<p>Then, a woman who was sitting near Araha called my name. A knight with blonde hair and sparkling eyes. She was someone I knew well.</p>
<p>“Rachel?”</p>
<p>Rachel and I exchanged curious glances.</p>
<p>“Hm? You two know each other?” A smile of interest emerged on Araha’s face.</p>
<p>Rachel looked back and forth between me and Jin Sahyuk before asking with a gulp, “How did you two…”</p>
<p>“Ah, Jin Sa-, er, Knight Commander Shin Jahyuk came as my companion. Her Royal Highness called us here.”</p>
<p>“Please, sit. Or do you plan on keeping me waiting?” Araha interrupted us and said with a cheery voice.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk and I sat down. Rachel still looked confused, and Araha clapped her hands, still smiling.</p>
<p>Immediately, several servants walked into the room with plates of food.</p>
<p>“Go ahead. I heard there’s a saying in your world that one should fill their stomach before enjoying the mountain view.”</p>
<p>With that, we began to eat. I munched on a king crab’s leg, and Jin Sahyuk sliced a premium steak.</p>
<p>Araha asked, “You’ve heard about the prophecy from Margrave Tomer, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I’ve called you to talk about that. We discovered a pathway that leads to your world, Earth.”</p>
<p>My eyes immediately widened.</p>
<p>Araha continued slowly as she munched on a piece of escargot, “But this pathway is in a dangerous place, and a huge amount of energy is needed to open it. Crevon isn’t capable of providing this energy.”</p>
<p>Energy…. That shouldn’t be a problem since the [Dimensional Entropy] was in our hands.</p>
<p>“I should be able to take care of the energy. Where is the pathway?” I asked.</p>
<p>Araha stared at me fixedly before letting out a deep sigh. “The 9th floor.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“The pathway to the outside world…” Araha paused. After collecting her breath, she muttered in a heavier voice, “…is deep inside the 9th floor filled with mythical monsters.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Desolate Moon Guild Building – Vice-Leader Shin Jonghak’s Office]</p>
<p>Desolate Moon’s newly appointed vice-leader, Shin Jonghak the Conqueror, was decorating his office. He placed his spear, which was the main reason he was granted the title ‘Conqueror’, on a shelf and placed a sculpture of himself he was gifted a long time ago next to it.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>Just looking at the sculpture brightened up his mood. It suited the interior design of the office and was perfect to represent the Hero Shin Jonghak, at least in his eyes.</p>
<p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak, who was wearing a satisfied smile, suddenly furrowed his brows. He had remembered it was Kim Hajin who sculpted this piece.</p>
<p>“That guy, why don’t I ever know where he is?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak clicked his tongue, sat down on his office chair and opened the newspaper. The first, second, and third pages were all about the ‘Gate of Glory’.</p>
<p>[3rd Round of Selections Begins for the Gate of Glory. Rising Star Chae Nayun, Kim Suho the ‘Sword Saint’, Shin Jonghak the ‘Conqueror’ Included]</p>
<p>[Norwegian Hero Bjormoj Steps Up to the Challenge… High-intermediate-rank Hero Leitlison Fails at 2nd Round]</p>
<p>—Vice-Leader, there’s news!</p>
<p>“Uwoah!”</p>
<p>A loud shout broke out as Shin Jonghak was reading. Startled, Shin Jonghak ripped the newspaper. Looking at the torn newspaper in his hands, Shin Jonghak sighed.</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>—I’ll send it over right now!</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak received the news on his computer. It was related to Essence of the Strait.</p>
<p>[Breaking News! Master-rank Hero, ‘Divine Archer’ Jin Seyeon, Joins Essence of the Strait!]</p>
<p>[Essence of the Strait Stocks Skyrocket…. Up 19% in 5 minutes!]</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak broke out into laughter while reading the news report. Jin Seyeon joining Essence of the Strait was certainly a shocking piece of news, especially considering how long she had remained independent. But it was nice seeing Yoo Yeonha, his long time friend, doing so well.</p>
<p>Although he wasn’t happy that Essence of the Strait was so far ahead of Desolate Moon, he knew Yoo Yeonha was no match for him in terms of battle prowess.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak continued to read with a pleased smile on his face. Then, his gaze subconsciously turned to the frame next to his monitor.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Inside the fist-sized frame was the young Shin Jonghak and his grandfather Shin Myungchul, both smiling happily.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak picked up the frame with a sigh. Shin Myungchul, the brightest of the Nine Stars and the man whose name will be forever recorded in history.</p>
<p>Even as his grandson, Shin Jonghak couldn’t understand why Shin Myungchul sacrificed himself.</p>
<p>Wasn’t his life worth more than the lives of a few million ordinary people? Didn’t he know that? Or did he sacrifice himself regardless?</p>
<p>“…Grandfather.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak recalled an old memory. In it, he was crying in the arms of his grandfather. At the time, just being by his side consoled him. Shin Jonghak was prouder of him than anyone else and considered him the eternal hero of humanity.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak muttered bitterly as he looked at his young self in the frame.</p>
<p>“I still resent you.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, inside the Essence of the Strait guild building, now being flooded with calls, Yoo Yeonha summoned Chae Nayun who was one of Essence of the Strait’s most famous Heroes.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun shouted as soon as she entered Yoo Yeonha’s office, “Is it true?! Jin Seyeon Hero-nim is joining our guild?!”</p>
<p>Her voice resounded loudly. Yoo Yeonha grinned and nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Wow….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s jaws dropped. It was an understandable reaction as most Master-rank Heroes who weren’t guild leaders themselves rarely stayed in guilds.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon joining Essence of the Strait was truly a piece of news worthy of all the buzz. But that wasn’t all that was surprising.</p>
<p>“Anyways, Nayun.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled lightly and took out the Balmung Kim Hajin gave her. Chae Nayun tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Take it.”</p>
<p>“What’s this? A baseball bat?”</p>
<p>Her reaction was to be expected. Balmung currently looked like a long stick more than anything else.</p>
<p>“This artifact is perfect for you.”</p>
<p>“This? What, is it the stone club Beowulf used?”</p>
<p>“No. Just try holding it.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha wanted to surprise Chae Nayun. So she gave Balmung to her without an explanation, and Chae Nayun held it with keen interest.</p>
<p>And at that moment— <em>whoosh!</em></p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha formed a small whip with her magic power and made a small cut on Chae Nayun’s arm.</p>
<p>“Ow!”</p>
<p>Blood flowed from the cut, and Chae Nayun turned to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p><em>Tk, tk—</em> Blood seeped into the stone sword.</p>
<p>“What was that for?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun eyed Yoo Yeonha angrily.</p>
<p>“Just watch.”</p>
<p>“I’m bleeding, geez.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shrugged. 500ml of blood was necessary to awaken Balmung, so she had no choice but to make the cut a little deep.</p>
<p>“Right? Look at my arm! It’s bleeding a lot!”</p>
<p>“Look at what’s in your hand.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Chae Nayun looked down, seething.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s body shook. The stone lump in her hand was sucking in her blood.</p>
<p>“H-Hey, what’s…”</p>
<p>She didn’t have the time to ask. Once Balmung absorbed enough blood, it emitted a bright light. Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun instinctively clad themselves in qi reinforcement.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa—</em> The erupting light soon seeped back into the stone.</p>
<p>“…Uh.”</p>
<p>Silence descended in the room.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun let out a short sound. The lump of stone in her hand had transformed into a sword.</p>
<p>Navy blue blade and a golden hilt. Just like in the myth of Siegfried, both light and darkness coexisted in the 1.8-meter-long greatsword.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked at it and said, “That’s Balmung.”</p>
<p>“Bal… this… holy…”</p>
<p>While Chae Nayun was lost in shock, Yoo Yeonha took out a document from her drawer. It was a contract for permanent lease of the weapon.</p>
<p>“You want it, right? You can have it if you sign here.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Oh, yeah, of course.”</p>
<p>When Yoo Yeonha showed her the contract, Chae Nayun signed it without even giving it a brief glance.</p>
<p>“What’s happening!?”</p>
<p>Then, Yoo Yeonha’s office door burst open. Heroes who detected Balmung’s magic power rushed inside.</p>
<p>But once they saw that both Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun were safe, their gaze turned to the only odd object in the room.</p>
<p>“…Wow.”</p>
<p>“The heck….”</p>
<p>Balmung, a weapon of many legends.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled at the dazed Heroes and gave them an explanation, “This is Balmung. Our major shareholder, XJ-nim, lent it to us.”</p>
<p>XJ was short for EXTRA HAJIN. His name was well-known as a major shareholder of Essence of the Strait, though no one knew his real identity.</p>
<p>“Cool, right? Feel free to take pictures and brag about it to your friends.”</p>
<p>A guild having such a valuable weapon boosted its image.</p>
<p>Even after hearing Yoo Yeonha’s explanation, the Heroes continued to stare at Balmung blankly.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Tower of Wish – 8F, Crevon]</p>
<p>Rain was falling in Crevon. I was sitting in the royal palace’s reception room, deep in thought.</p>
<p>Araha said that the pathway was on the 9th floor. I didn’t know whether or not she was telling the truth, but I could probably just leave the Chameleon Troupe to take care of it. After all, Cheok Jungyeong was always itching for a fight.</p>
<p>“Why haven’t you responded to my messages?”</p>
<p>Then, I heard Rachel’s voice from nearby. She was talking to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Do I have a reason to?” Jin Sahyuk answered.</p>
<p>“…I see.” Rachel nodded her head without even the slightest change in her expression. But anyone could tell that she was hurt by the blunt response.</p>
<p>“Hajin-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>I turned to Rachel with a smile. Rachel also put on a smile and nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jin Sahyuk looked back and forth between me and Rachel. Feeling her gaze, Rachel also turned to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Just like that, a silent battle began between the two.</p>
<p>“Haha… huh? What’s that?”</p>
<p>Looking around the room, I found a pool table in the corner of the room. From what I heard, all sorts of sports spread by Players were trending in Crevon.</p>
<p>“Um, do you guys want to play some pool?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Pool?”</p>
<p>Rachel’s eyes suddenly brightened.</p>
<p>“…I’d be happy to. Are you good, Hajin-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Uh… It’s hard for me to be bad at it, I guess?”</p>
<p>I had Young Dwarf’s Dexterity after all.</p>
<p>“Pft.” But Rachel suddenly snorted. It was the first time I was seeing her sneer. It must have come out subconsciously as she immediately fixed her expression, but I was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry. It’s just that I’m… quite good at pool. I even won a tournament.”</p>
<p>“Ah… I see.”</p>
<p>I nodded thoughtlessly at Rachel’s proud comment, but that ended up triggering Jin Sahyuk’s competitive spirit.</p>
<p>“What pool are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“English billiards, straight pool, carom, eight-ball, it doesn’t matter to me.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Then let’s go with carom.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Rachel was full of confidence, which Jin Sahyuk seemed to hate. Jin Sahyuk stomped towards the pool table and grabbed a cue. Rachel also grabbed one with a grin.</p>
<p>“Shall we begin?”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s a bit boring if we’re not betting on something. What should we bet?”</p>
<p>“A bet… What about a wish?”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye. But just as the match was about begin…</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>I was contacted by Spartan who was outside the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>—Yoo Jinhyuk messaged that his investigation of Yi Yeonjun is complete.</p>
<p>—Yi Yeonjun seems to be up to something. It doesn’t seem urgent. Currently on the lookout.</p>
<p>I got up to return to Earth the moment I received Spartan’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving now. You guys have fun.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“She’s right. Kim Hajin, you’re playing too.”</p>
<p>But Rachel and Jin Sahyuk grabbed me simultaneously. Rachel even handed me a cue.</p>
<p>“Don’t run away. You’re playing for a wish too.”</p>
<p>“…Me too?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Rachel and Jin Sahyuk were ready to go all out.</p>
<p>“Uh… okay.”</p>
<p>Since Spartan wasn’t in a hurry, I agreed and decided to quickly stomp them and leave.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go first.”</p>
<p>I put some chalk on the cue tip and got ready. But Jin Sahyuk and Rachel weren’t placing me in their eyes at all.</p>
<p>“I’m curious how good you are, Former Knight Commander.”</p>
<p>“I’m curious too.”</p>
<p>“Please, teach me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you’re good enough to be my disciple.”</p>
<p>“…Annoying me. Is that a tactic?”</p>
<p>“Please, why would I need to stoop to such a level against a beginner?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Little did they know, they wouldn’t even have the chance to show off their skills.</p>
<p>“I’m going.”</p>
<p>I planned on ending it on turn one.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 311. Virtual Reality Containing the Truth (1)</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Rachel and Jin Sahyuk sat in the reception room of the royal palace in shock. The pool table and the cue sticks that they never got to use were in front of them.</p>
<p>The game had ended instantly.</p>
<p>At this point, neither of them could remember how many points they were playing for. They didn’t even want to think about how the game unfolded.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin, the man responsible for this mess, instructed Rachel to ‘give Jin Sahyuk skillbooks’ and Jin Sahyuk to ‘listen to Rachel’. He then left the royal palace without looking back.</p>
<p>Everything felt futile.</p>
<p>“…This game shouldn’t be that easy,” Jin Sahyuk muttered and put a cue stick down on the table.</p>
<p>Hit too hard, the ball breaks. Hit too weak, the ball loses its course. Using magic power was also prohibited.</p>
<p>Pool was a difficult game for superhumans who had beyond average strength.</p>
<p><em>Tak—!</em></p>
<p>She posed properly and hit the cue ball. The ball hit the first target, bounced against the wall and then hit the second.</p>
<p>“I'm in a good condition today. Can’t believe the game ended before I even got to play. Oi, you…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk casually turned her gaze to the side, only to be startled by Rachel.</p>
<p>The princess looked as if her soul had escaped her body.</p>
<p>“…Are you crying?”</p>
<p>“…Eh? N-No.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin didn’t know this, but as the three-time winner of Crevon’s Pool Tournament, Rachel took pride in this game. With delicate and elaborate techniques stemming from her experience in dealing with spirits, Rachel has long been the reigning queen of billiards.</p>
<p>“It… doesn’t matter anymore. Please, follow me.”</p>
<p>Still in shock, Rachel beckoned to Jin Sahyuk. She planned to show Jin Sahyuk the skill books as she had been instructed to do by Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk followed Rachel willingly.</p>
<p>Rachel walked ahead and asked, “Special and Basic Skills, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Something that will be useful in real life. Got anything good?”</p>
<p>“There should be. This is the royal palace, after all.”</p>
<p>The two of them walked down the hallway and arrived at the library accessible only to the members of the royal family and their close associates.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>“…Ooh.”</p>
<p>The library was big and the ceilings were high. Jin Sahyuk looked around in amazement. Every single one of the carefully carved bookshelves was a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Of course, they were nothing compared to Plerion.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you look around and see if anything catches your eye?” Rachel said.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk did as she was told. She walked slowly, her eyes skimming over the books. Skillbooks, history books, magic books, educational books, etc. The library had everything.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spent some time looking over the books and studying various skills. In the past, she had thought some of them were useless, but now they all seemed interesting.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Shin Jahyuk-ssi.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Rachel called Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked back, her gaze still fixed on the book.</p>
<p>“Um….” Rachel hesitated.</p>
<p>Finding it strange, Jin Sahyuk raised her head and looked at Rachel. 10 seconds passed by.</p>
<p>Finally, Rachel asked with a small sigh, “What kind of relationship do you have with Hajin-ssi?”</p>
<p>“…Hm? Uh… nothing, I guess.”</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk already knew Kim Hajin’s secret.</p>
<p>She also learned about ‘Synchronization’ from Bell.</p>
<p>And, she knew how Kim Hajin would change once she managed to increase his Synchronization rate.</p>
<p>And so— with a meaningful smile, she added, “…For now.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[16F — Genkelope’s Vessel]</p>
<p>I returned to the Genkelope’s Vessel. The vessel was again roaming above the ‘Genkelope Zone’ on the 16th floor. It seemed that the mission to recapture the Zone was still in progress.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Ship Commander.”</p>
<p>Horner came out of the Commander’s Office where he had been observing the land below to greet me. I welcomed Horner with a smile.</p>
<p>“Good to see you. And my guest?”</p>
<p>“She’s waiting for you in the VIP lounge.”</p>
<p>Today was the day I would deliver the [Ceremonial Descent Robe] to Medea, my last guest in the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>“Okay, thanks.”</p>
<p>I headed for the VIP lounge, surrounded by warm welcomes from the crew.</p>
<p>I held a beautifully decorated gift box in one hand and opened the door with the other.</p>
<p>Medea was waiting for me inside, as expected.</p>
<p>“You’re finally here.”</p>
<p>Medea looked at me with a surly expression. It was a natural response, as I was well past the deadline.</p>
<p>I gave a small smile and held out the gift box in my hand.</p>
<p>“I put a lot of effort into making it.”</p>
<p>“Well, even considering that you’re way too late….”</p>
<p>Medea stomped up to me. Her face glimmered with joy and desire that she failed to hide.</p>
<p>“Give it.”</p>
<p>But there was one more thing I had to ask Medea before giving her this robe.</p>
<p>“Are you planning on descending soon, then?”</p>
<p>“…Probably?”</p>
<p>Medea nodded nonchalantly with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>“And you haven’t forgotten about our promise, right?”</p>
<p>“…Promise?”</p>
<p>I took out the copy of [Heynckes’s Dagger].</p>
<p>“Oh~ that?”</p>
<p>Medea and I made an oath over this dagger to never betray humanity and to help humans out at all costs. I couldn’t risk having Medea run away like the former Nine Star Oh Jaejin.</p>
<p>“Of course I haven’t.”</p>
<p>Medea nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>That was all I needed to hear.</p>
<p>Medea, the great sorceress who had been mentioned several times in Greek mythology.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to see the world that I’m going to live in fall apart either.”</p>
<p>I was sure that a person of such caliber would be of great help to this world.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>After I delivered the robe to Medea, I left the Tower of Wish. Spartan informed me that Yi Yeonjun was still in France, and my next destination was determined.</p>
<p>With Spartan, I flew to Paris, France.</p>
<p>More precisely, my destination was the Champ de Mars where the Eiffel Tower, the iconic landmark of Paris, stood. I planned on observing Yi Yeonjun from there.</p>
<p>…However.</p>
<p>[★ Hosting the 3rd preliminary round of the Gate of Glory Qualification Tournament ★]</p>
<p>[Welcome to Paris.]</p>
<p>[The Paris branch of Essence of the Strait welcomes you!]</p>
<p>[Heroes, please join us at the Eiffel Tower!]</p>
<p>[We love you Kim Suho ♥]</p>
<p>[Hero discount….]</p>
<p>“…What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Paris was clearly in the middle of a celebration. Though it was late at night the city was brightly lit, parades and carnivals everywhere. From the big banners written in Korean, I could tell Paris was excited to be the host of the 3rd preliminary round of the Gate of Glory Qualification Tournament.</p>
<p>“Is it really worth getting this excited about?”</p>
<p>Even considering the fact that the Qualification Tournament was drawing global attention, it still felt excessive. It was as if Paris had been chosen to host the World Cup.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>I began searching for Yi Yeonjun under the bright lights.</p>
<p>“…Where is he?”</p>
<p>However, no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t spot Yi Yeonjun and was left with no choice but to rely on Spartan’s vision again.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was not above but underground.</p>
<p>“What the.”</p>
<p>The man next to Yi Yeonjun looked familiar. No, it was more than just familiar— I knew who this man was.</p>
<p>Switching sides on a whim, he was notoriously fickle, but just like Team Rocket, he never accomplished anything.</p>
<p>“Team Rocket, I mean, Lancaster?”</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, I listened in on their conversation.</p>
<p>—…I offer you ‘England’.</p>
<p>As expected, Lancaster was scheming against England again.</p>
<p>He sure was persistent.</p>
<p>—I have top secret information about the British national security with me as well as other confidential documents. With this, you can turn England into a second Pandemonium. The class-1 security codes can neutralize the entire British system and disable all shields.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun stared at Lancaster in silence.</p>
<p>Thinking he spotted greed in Yi Yeonjun’s nonchalant expression, Lancaster offered a proposal.</p>
<p>—…There’s only one thing I want. Please destroy the British royal family.</p>
<p>Top secret information about the British national security that Lancaster claimed to know… I wasn’t sure what they were, but right now my top priority was Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>I took out my smartwatch and opened Violet Times.</p>
<p>==[Violet Times]==</p>
<p>[Investigator Yoo Jinhyuk has completed your request.]</p>
<p>[Here is the flash drive containing information about Yi Yeonjun’s past.]</p>
<p>[Please pay the complete amount within two weeks.]</p>
<p>***************</p>
<p>A small portal appeared above the smartwatch.</p>
<p>I put my hand inside the portal and pulled out the flash drive Yoo Jinhyuk sent me.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>“What’re ya doing here?”</p>
<p>A familiar voice struck my eardrums with crushing weight. Startled, I looked up.</p>
<p>“…You scared me.”</p>
<p>There, Cheok Jungeyong was looking down at me.</p>
<p>With a smirk, he put his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“…You’re right. But why are you here, Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
<p>“Me? They’re hosting the 3rd preliminary round or something here, that’s what I’m here for.”</p>
<p>“Alone?”</p>
<p>“Yup. Fun things should be done alone.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>I nodded and turned my attention to the flash drive and Yoo Jinhyuk’s message.</p>
<p>[Yoo Jinhyuk: I’ve put together the most crucial pieces of information regarding Yi Yeonjun’s past. I even included a flash drive containing all the information as a gesture of goodwill for the VIP customer.]</p>
<p>[Directions: Infuse your magic power into the flash drive and insert it in a virtual reality capsule or a virtual reality helmet.]</p>
<p>[I recommend a ‘whole body capsule’ in place of a ‘helmet’ for a more engaging experience.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Yoo Jinhyuk’s flash drive]</p>
<p>—A flash drive containing the extracted past.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…Mmm.”</p>
<p>‘So something like this was possible, after all.’</p>
<p>The reason Yoo Jinhyuk delivered his research in the format of a flash drive was that he wanted his customers to experience the same things as himself.</p>
<p>“Oi, what’s that? Looks sort of fun.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Cheok Jungeyong shoved his head in towards me.</p>
<p>“Nothing. It’s just….”</p>
<p>I was about to change the subject when, suddenly, an idea crossed my mind.</p>
<p>No one said this flash drive was strictly for one person. I knew more than two people could play the same game or watch the same video at the same time using the ‘party’ option in a whole body capsule.</p>
<p>“…Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What?”</p>
<p>“Do you know Yi Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong gave a small frown.</p>
<p>“No, not really. All I know about him is that he was the former leader of the Chameleon Troupe and also Boss’s savior.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong was honest.</p>
<p>I looked down at the flash drive in silence.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong had no prior relationship with Yi Yeonjun. What’s more, he even seemed disgruntled by the former leader's presence.</p>
<p>Well, then….</p>
<p>“Cheok Jungyeong, follow me.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Why?”</p>
<p>“This,” I put up the flash drive and suggested, “You said this looked fun. So let’s look at it together.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong folded his arms, pretending to be uninterested, but soon broke into a smile and came close to me.</p>
<p>“Where can we look at it?”</p>
<p>“Right over there.”</p>
<p>I pointed at [Capsule de Mars], the largest capsule cafe and one of the most famous tourist attractions in France.</p>
<p>“Capsule? So that thing runs by a capsule?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never used a capsule before.”</p>
<p>I headed to the capsule cafe with Cheok Jungyeong who still looked confused.</p>
<p>“Welcome~”</p>
<p>I paid the cafe owner in won and borrowed two capsules. An extra-large-sized capsule for Cheok Jungyeong and a medium-sized capsule for me.</p>
<p>As soon as I was online, I sent Cheok Jungyeong a friend request.</p>
<p>“Cheok Jungyeong, are you ready?”</p>
<p>—Uh… wait… this is so damn complicated…. Ah, there. I accepted your friend request and party invitation. Am I all set?</p>
<p>“Yeah. Give me a moment. I’m putting in the flash drive now.”</p>
<p>I infused my magic power—Stigma—into the flash drive.</p>
<p>“Here we go,” I said and plugged the flash drive into the capsule.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa—</em></p>
<p>“What the….”</p>
<p>A cluster of light formed inside the capsule.</p>
<p>The mysterious light shot out of the capsule and enveloped my entire body.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kim Suho and Chae Nayun were busy playing games in the capsule cafe. Their excuse was to relieve stress and relax before the 3rd preliminary round began.</p>
<p>But the real reason they came here was purely because of Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>There was no way that Chae Nayun, an avid gamer, could pass up an opportunity to visit [Capsule de Mars], the world-famous capsule cafe.</p>
<p>“Uhahaha. Kim Suho, you sucker! You’re terrible at games. I can’t even keep track of how many times you lost!”</p>
<p>Inside the virtual world, Chae Nayun teased Kim Suho, who had just lost to her. Kim Suho scratched the back of his neck in embarrassment.</p>
<p>—…Ah. This is kinda hard.</p>
<p>“Who’s up next?”</p>
<p>The game they were playing right now was called ‘Gladiator of the Century’.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun won not only against Kim Suho but also against Shin Jonghak and Yun Seung-Ah. She wasn’t ranked no. 1 for nothing.</p>
<p>—Nayun, can’t we just play something else?</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon suggested, completely worn out from the duel.</p>
<p>—Good idea. We should play something else. I’m getting tired of this.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak agreed.</p>
<p>“Something else?”</p>
<p>Deep in thought, Chae Nayun turned her gaze to her friend list. Currently online were Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Yun Seung-Ah, Yi Jiyoon, and… Yoo Yeonha?</p>
<p>[Yoo Yeonha — Playing at ‘Capsule de Mars’, Paris]</p>
<p>“What the. Yoo Yeonha is here?”</p>
<p>—Yoo Yeonha? <em>The</em> Yoo Yeonha?</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah’s hologram widened her eyes.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It says right here that she’s playing at Capsule de Mars. She must be here in Paris. Unni, can we include Yeonha and play GTA 3 on 3?”</p>
<p>—Sure, anything but Gladiator of the Century.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and others nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“Okay, then.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun invited Yoo Yeonha to her party.</p>
<p>Though Yoo Yeonha was a bit hesitant, she accepted the invitation. Immediately five holograms, not including Chae Nayun, appeared in the common area.</p>
<p>“Hey, Yeonha.”</p>
<p>—Hey. So you were here, after all, Nayun.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked at Chae Nayun with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Of course I am. But why are you here?”</p>
<p>—I came to Paris as a member of the Association… and I have some documents to go over regarding the capsules.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled bitterly and showed Chae Nayun the stack of documents. Chae Nayun felt sick at the mere sight of it.</p>
<p>“Damn. Put that thing down and let’s play a game.”</p>
<p>—Sorry, I’m busy.</p>
<p>“Hey, this is your chance to rest. There’s more to life than just work! You don’t have to take care of that right this moment.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah, Kim Suho, and Shin Jonghak added to Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>—Why don’t you rest a bit, Chief Officer? I’m a guild-leader and even I’m slacking off. You’re making me feel guilty.</p>
<p>—Exactly. Take a break.</p>
<p>—They’re right, Yeonha. Play just one game.</p>
<p>—…What did you say?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha glared at Shin Jonghak disapprovingly, but soon heaved a sigh and nodded.</p>
<p>—Fine. I’ll play just one game. I need to talk to Jonghak anyways.</p>
<p>“Yay! Okay, wait a sec.”</p>
<p>As soon as her friend gave in, Chae Nayun pulled up their next game, ‘Grand Theft Auto XS’.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>[Asking party members to join….]</p>
<p>[All members have entered.]</p>
<p>[Accessing ‘Grand Theft Auto XS’.]</p>
<p>The game was about to start, when suddenly—</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa….</em></p>
<p>A giant ray of light swallowed them whole.</p>
<p>Surprised by the radiance, Chae Nayun closed her eyes. And when she opened them again….</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, Yun Seung-Ah, Yoo Yeonha, Yi Jiyoon, Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>The six players were standing above an unfamiliar ground.</p>
<p>“Wow… Nayun, what’s the name of this game? It feels so real. Ah, my eyes still hurt,” Yi Jiyoon remarked.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha also turned to Chae Nayun and waited for her answer.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>But Chae Nayun couldn’t say anything.</p>
<p>Having played [Grand Theft Auto XS] for an astounding 200 hours, Chae Nayun was currently very confused.</p>
<p>“…Where are we?”</p>
<p>This was definitely not what [Grand Theft Auto XS] looked like.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 312. Virtual Reality Containing the Truth (2), (3)</p>
<p>“What the….”</p>
<p>Chae Nyun looked around in awe. They were standing over a barren field at night. But she could see neon lights and tall buildings in the distance.</p>
<p>“…This is some amazing technology. It feels real.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s remark startled Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>‘Did they go through a major update or something? No, but if they did, then I would’ve known about it.’</p>
<p>“Right. But are we in a… slum area?”</p>
<p>Even as Chae Nayun tried to make sense of the situation, her comrades’ conversation continued.</p>
<p>“Slum?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho widened his eyes at the word. Yun Seung-Ah nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>“You guys wouldn’t know about it, but a long time ago there were ‘neon cities’ just like that one on the outskirts of Seoul or Suwon. Most of them were in the slums.”</p>
<p>“Of course you’d know, since you’re in your thirties.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha caught Yun Seung-Ah off guard.</p>
<p>“W-What?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah hissed at Yoo Yeonha like a cat, but the younger girl simply shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s true.”</p>
<p>“I mean, sure, but…. You don’t have to point it out, Chief Officer.”</p>
<p>It was then that Chae Nayun suddenly shouted out loud.</p>
<p>“Pouch!”</p>
<p>The exclamation immediately drew everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“…Phew,” Chae Nayun let out a sigh of relief as she held a pouch in her hand.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah tilted her head in curiosity.</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s that, Nayun?”</p>
<p>“Ah~ This is the inventory, just in the shape of a pouch. It’s not uncommon for open world games like ‘GTA’— I mean, ‘Grand Theft Auto’ to refer to inventory as something else.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun smirked and checked inside her pouch.</p>
<p>“My level is high, so this pouch should be able to hold anything under… 300kg….”</p>
<p>However, the maximum capacity of the pouch was only 3kg, and Chae Nayun became silent.</p>
<p>“Pouch! Wow, it really works!”</p>
<p>“Pouch.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah summoned their pouches after Chae Nayun. They examined them in detail, mesmerized by the technology.</p>
<p>Suddenly Yoo Yeonha announced, “Enough with the chitchat. We should really get going. I don’t have much time to spare. I have to finish this quickly and go back.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>‘I have to finish this quickly and go back.’ Yoo Yeonha’s words instilled a sense of uneasiness in Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“Okay~ Let’s get moving~ How do I take screenshots here? I wanna upload some photos on social media.”</p>
<p>“God, you should seriously take a break from the social media, Yi Jiyoon.”</p>
<p>The party began to move toward the neon city.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, too, began walking with Shin Jonghak by her side.</p>
<p>“So when we get there, we break and destroy and fight, right? At least that’s what everyone was doing on YouTube.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh…. N-No. Be quiet and remain calm.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that what this game is about, though?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, just leave me alone.”</p>
<p>The moment she deserted Shin Jonghak, Yun Seung-Ah approached her.</p>
<p>“Nayun, how do you level up in this game? I’m having trouble controlling my magic power and I think it’s because my level is too low.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Um…, give me a sec.”</p>
<p>Logout, logout, logout, logout…. Chae Nayun muttered to herself dozens of times but neither the logout window nor the settings page appeared before her.</p>
<p>“…Dammit. I’m totally screwed,” She grumbled in dismay, finally giving up.</p>
<p>“Oh? Look, a sign.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho, who was leading the way, was the first to discover the city's sign.</p>
<p>[Suwon Area A]</p>
<p>“Suwon Area A…. It’s just as you said, leader. This is Suwon.”</p>
<p>“Really? Interesting. This map must be based on Suwon before the administrative changes, if they’re still calling this area Area A.”</p>
<p>The party passed the sign and entered the city.</p>
<p>Neon lights were lined up in the street. Under the colored lights were market stalls, pubs with outdoor tables, red lanterns and motels. The city appeared more enigmatic up close.</p>
<p>Gazing across the unfamiliar cityscape, Yoo Yeonha asked, “Nayun, what year is this game based on?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh… to find out, we might have to pay a visit to the PC cafe or the motel over there.”</p>
<p>“How about money? How do we make money?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Money…?”</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>Suddenly a group of men jumped out of the back alley. They were holding knives, baseball bats, wooden sticks and other weapons in their hands.</p>
<p>“Uhahaha! You!”</p>
<p>A man wearing a bandana, who seemed to be the leader of the group, came forward and shouted, “If you value your life, hand over everything you have!”</p>
<p>The party stared at him in silence, then suddenly Chae Nayun raised her arm and pointed at the thugs.</p>
<p>She muttered, “There it is. Money.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. The first thing I saw was a faded ceiling. I was conscious but still a bit hazy. Then, all of a sudden, an unbearable amount of pain engulfed the right side of my body.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The source of the pain was my right arm.</p>
<p>The pain woke me up fully, and only then did I realize what had happened to me.</p>
<p>It was simple.</p>
<p>First, I delivered the final robe to Medea at the Tower of Wish. Then I traveled to Paris where I received a flash drive from Yoo Sihyuk containing information about Yi Yeonjun’s past. Next, I went to [Capsule de Mars], the largest capsule cafe in France, to check the contents of the flash drive. And then when I plugged the flash drive infused with Stigma into a capsule— the flash drive suddenly began absorbing my Stigma.</p>
<p>It all happened so quickly that I didn’t have enough time to control the flow of my magic power.</p>
<p>“You finally up?”</p>
<p>A thick voice struck my ears.</p>
<p>It came from Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>With a sigh, I examined my arm. It was bruised to the point that I couldn't recognize the symbol of Stigma. I couldn’t move it at all.</p>
<p>“Oi, you okay?”</p>
<p>“I’m okay…. Where are we, by the way?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know, some sort of a shrine or church or somethin’. But why are we here?”</p>
<p>‘Shrine? Church?’</p>
<p>I tilted my head in confusion, when suddenly a sharp pain shot through my right arm again. The movement of magic power inside Stigma that I knew I should feel at all times was only vague.</p>
<p>“Ugh… logout!” I shouted, hoping to escape from the pain, but my effort was fruitless.</p>
<p>“…Video information. Pause. Connection status.”</p>
<p>Other system functions also failed to load as if they had been intentionally blocked.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’d like to know. What’re ya doing?”</p>
<p>Something was strange. Different. This was definitely not what a recorded video felt like.</p>
<p>All I could infer right now was that Yoo Jinhyuk’s flash drive and my Stigma caused some kind of reaction when they fused together…. Judging by the condition of my arm, I knew that ‘Overclock’ had also been activated. That must be the reason why Cheok Jungyeong got swept up in this.</p>
<p>Was I too naive? Should I have been more careful before plugging in the flash drive?</p>
<p>…No, I never would have imagined something like this to happen.</p>
<p>More importantly, I believed in my luck. Though I wasn’t sure at this point whether my luck had just saved me by a hair or was an active partaker in the latest turn of events.</p>
<p>“Oi, ya hurt yer head or somethin’?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong frowned.</p>
<p><em>Beep—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, the message Yoo Jinhyuk had left me appeared in midair.</p>
<p>=Yoo Jinhyuk’s message=</p>
<p>[Dear customer, while investigating Yi Yeonjun’s past as instructed, I noticed a strange relationship between ‘Yi Yeonjun’ and the ‘current boss of the Chameleon Troupe’.]</p>
<p>[I believed this was something you were interested in, so I focused my research on those two.]</p>
<p>[My messages will arrive in order at the exact moments I have intended.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Oi?”</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to Cheok Jungyeong. Then I got up. Looking closely, the surrounding scenery resembled a church more than a shrine.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’re in a church lounge. Follow me, Cheok Jungyeong.”</p>
<p>We stepped outside.</p>
<p>Outside, there were three buildings lined up around a large, barren field.</p>
<p>One was the chapel, one was the nursery, one was the lounge. I could hear the kids laughing and talking in the nursery even from where I was standing.</p>
<p>“Hey, over there.”</p>
<p>I was examining the nursery building, when Cheok Jungyeong suddenly slapped me on the shoulder. With a serious look, he pointed at the field. I turned my gaze to where he was pointing.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>A short exclamation escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>There, in a corner of the field, a child sat alone in the bleachers under the shade.</p>
<p>“She’s the one, right?” Cheok Jungyeong asked, stroking his chin.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I nodded.</p>
<p>Disheveled, tangled black hair and dull eyes. Even in the cold and loneliness she stared straight ahead as if waiting for someone to come back to her.</p>
<p>My heart hurt just looking at her.</p>
<p>“That’s Boss.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chae Nayun and the others arrived at a motel somewhere in Area A. Though the room was a bit too small for six people, it wasn’t too bad right now because Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah had just left for a walk.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of robbers but only in the alley. In the main street there are shops and pubs, so it’s not as bad as Pandemonium. I wouldn’t say the level of difficulty is too high.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was currently analyzing the game, looking down at the street through the motel window.</p>
<p>“Nayun, shouldn’t we run around the city and receive missions? Like main quests or sub quests?” Yi Jiyoon asked Chae Nayun, clearly excited.</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, y-yeah, sure. But the thing is….”</p>
<p>“Oh, right.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, <em>clap—</em> Yoo Yeonha clapped her hands.</p>
<p>“Do you think this computer works?”</p>
<p>“Uh… I-I don’t know. Try turning it on.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha started examining the dusty old computer with eyes full of curiosity.</p>
<p>“This is so old. How do I even turn it on?”</p>
<p>She wasn’t at all acquainted with a ‘desktop’.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha managed to find the power key only after carefully investigating the computer case.</p>
<p>“Woah, it’s on.”</p>
<p><em>Vroom—</em> With a buzzing sound, the screen lighted up. The others stood next to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p><em>Vroom— Vroom— Vroom—</em></p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…Haam.”</p>
<p>“This is slow.”</p>
<p>They all stared at the screen for 3 whole minutes.</p>
<p>Finally the boot up ended and the first thing Yoo Yeonha did was check the date.</p>
<p>“…December 18th, 2006?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha wasn’t even born then.</p>
<p>With a big smile, Yi Jiyoon exclaimed, “Woah~ So we’re in the 2000s, leader?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. But mid-2000s is… a weird setting for a game.”</p>
<p>After the tumultuous 60s, superhumans were born in the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>In the 90s, with the help of the said superhumans, Korea recaptured its stolen territories and the Hero system was first established.</p>
<p>In the 00s, Korea saw a major growth in technology along with the growing population of Heroes.</p>
<p>But from 2000 to 2010 was simply a transition period. The gap between the rich and the poor widened with the rapid advancement of technology, and the number of slums increased beyond the reach of government authority. It was considered by many to be a shameful era.</p>
<p>“At least the details seem accurate….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha turned the computer off after surfing the web for a while. Then she looked around the room to see where Shin Jonghak was. He was in the middle of training.</p>
<p>“Jonghak, do you wanna go for a walk?”</p>
<p>“…A walk?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we can look around the neighborhood, see what’s where. We still have some money left from the robbers, so we can buy things, too.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak seemed reluctant, and Chae Nayun immediately intervened.</p>
<p>“Sounds fun! Go, go!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun pulled Shin Jonghak towards Yoo Yeonha. She was clearly acting strange, but thankfully the pair left without saying much.</p>
<p>Now she and Yi Jiyoon were the only ones left in the room.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun looked at Yi Jiyoon, and Yi Jiyoon looked at Chae Nayun with her round eyes.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun sighed. She fell onto the bed, her hands over her head.</p>
<p>“Nayun?”</p>
<p>“…I think I need to get some sleep. Why don’t you go outside and play?”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon nodded, but instead of leaving she sat in front of the motel’s computer. She had never seen this type of operating system before, but was skilled enough to quickly get the hang of it.</p>
<p>…Just like that, 3 hours passed by.</p>
<p>“Mmmnn~”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon pulled her head away from the computer screen and stretched. At that precise moment, Yoo Yeonha and Shin Jonghak returned to the room. They were carrying a dagger, a spear, a sword, and other types of weapons with them.</p>
<p>“Here, this is for you, Nayun. A weapon.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun received the sword without putting up a fight. It was an item named [Typical Iron Sword].</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, the door opened again, and Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah entered the room. With a beaming smile, the pair handed out snacks and other food to the rest of the team.</p>
<p>They spent some time chewing gum and eating snacks.</p>
<p>…15 minutes later.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha, who was chewing on dried squid legs— pretending they didn’t suit her taste— finally asked, “By the way, Nayun, how do you logout of this game?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Logout.</p>
<p>The word surprised Chae Nayun, and Yoo Yeonha asked again, “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“…H-Huh? What?”</p>
<p>“I said, how do you logout of this game?”</p>
<p>“Um…. Uh….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun glanced at her friends. Everyone was looking at her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know… now, how did I do it before?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha frowned.</p>
<p>“Stop with the jokes and teach me. It’s already been 4 hours. I have to attend an event soon.”</p>
<p>“R-Really? 4 hours already? Time sure flies~”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha glared at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun shuddered in fear.</p>
<p>“So? How do I sign out?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Nayun?”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Oh… that’s….”</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun closed her mouth and Yoo Yeonha scowled at her friend. Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Yi Jiyoon and Yun Seung-Ah, they were all focused on her.</p>
<p>“…T-That’s… uh….”</p>
<p>Her heart was racing. Her breathing became heavy and cold sweat trickled down her back. Her head was spinning and she was beginning to feel dizzy….</p>
<p>There was only one way out of this.</p>
<p><em>Gulp</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun swallowed her saliva, and…</p>
<p><em>Kooong—!</em> …smashed her head on the floor.</p>
<p>“Sorry! I have no idea where we are! I don’t know how to log out of this thing!”</p>
<p>A cry of despair filled the motel room.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Nameless Nursery]</p>
<p>“…She’s doing nothing,” Cheok Jungyeong noted.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” I answered.</p>
<p>“Are you sure she’s Boss?” Cheok Jungeyong asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sure,” I answered again.</p>
<p>And then for a while we stared at the girl in silence.</p>
<p>3 minutes later, Cheok Jungyeong leered at me.</p>
<p>“…So you’re here to spy on young Boss?”</p>
<p>“No. I’m here to investigate Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>“Yi Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He doesn’t seem to like me, for some reason.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“…Yes. But I didn’t expect this to happen.”</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong stroked his chin.</p>
<p>“So, what you’re saying is, that flash drive and your magic power responded to each other and a whole new world was created?”</p>
<p>I had spent the last three hours explaining the cause of this phenomenon to Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“It’s not a ‘whole new world’, it’s just a fully manifested virtual reality based on the data of the past. But you’ve got most of it.”</p>
<p>“Uh. So how do we get outta here?”</p>
<p>“That… we’ll have to see.”</p>
<p>I stared at Boss.</p>
<p>Right now, Boss was waiting for someone.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinhyuk probably wanted me to see only the most important events, so I believed that if I continued to watch Boss closely, then I would eventually reach the truth.</p>
<p>“Oi, but what if we spend so much time in here that everyone outside ends up dead?” Cheok Jungeyong asked, slightly worried.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. We’re inside a virtual reality, so the concept of time only applies to our brains.”</p>
<p>“…What the heck does that mean?”</p>
<p>“It means that the flow of the time is different here. It’s okay to stay here for a long time.”</p>
<p>I could infer this based on the difference of the consciousness between me and Spartan. Though I couldn’t pin down the exact ratio, I was sure that time in here passed a lot quicker than time in the real world.</p>
<p>“…I’ll kill you if you’re lying.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>At that moment, we saw a luxury sedan enter into the field. Boss responded to the headlights. She stood up with a faint smile across her face.</p>
<p>“Hide.”</p>
<p>We hid ourselves as best as we could.</p>
<p>Surrounded by the darkness of the night, the sedan smoothly glided across the field. Soon the back doors opened and a man and a woman got off the vehicle.</p>
<p>Boss slowly walked up to them, visibly nervous.</p>
<p>It was then that I received Yoo Jinhyuk’s message.</p>
<p>==[Yoo Jinhyuk’s message]==</p>
<p>[The man and the woman are the girl’s parents.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The man was the first to discover Boss. He stopped in front of the girl and frowned.</p>
<p>—…I told you not to come outside.</p>
<p>I already knew this part of her past. It was in my original settings.</p>
<p>—Why are you here?</p>
<p>Despite her father’s cold demeanor, Boss smiled weakly. She seemed happy just to see him.</p>
<p>—…Um, this.</p>
<p>Boss took something out of her pocket. It was a bracelet made of flowers and shadows. She probably made them herself.</p>
<p>However, her father suddenly clenched his fist, and…</p>
<p><em>Tak!</em></p>
<p>…kicked the bracelet.</p>
<p>—…I don’t need anything made with that cursed power of yours, you little freak.</p>
<p>“That bastard—”</p>
<p>I grabbed Cheok Jungyeong's wrist and tried to calm him down.</p>
<p>“Shh. It’s all just a virtual reality anyway.”</p>
<p>At that moment, her mother came forward. She looked down at Boss with eyes full of disdain and clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>—You really are a cursed child. Haven’t I told you before not to pick flowers! Don’t you feel bad for the flowers?</p>
<p>Their cruelty made me doubt whether they were really her parents.</p>
<p>The couple trampled on Boss’s bracelet and headed for the nursery building. Boss stared at their backs as they left.</p>
<p>But Boss didn’t cry. In fact, her expression remained unchanged. She picked up her bracelet from the ground, and, <em>grumble—</em> with an empty stomach, began walking towards the nursery.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>“Those bastards, I’m gonna tear their stomachs open and jump rope with their intestines—”</p>
<p>“Ugh, be quiet.”</p>
<p>I put my hand over Cheok Jungyeong’s mouth and got up. Of course I felt bad, but this was just virtual reality. What’s happened already happened.</p>
<p>Right then, I received another message.</p>
<p>==[Yoo Jinhyuk’s message]==</p>
<p>[Find out where her parents came from. You’ll find Yi Yeonjun there.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>These messages that Yoo Jinhyuk left me were very useful.</p>
<p><em>Ssssk—</em></p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Sssk—</em></p>
<p>I felt a presence behind the bushes across the field.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t just a presence.</p>
<p>[User]</p>
<p>I saw a marker— ’User’.</p>
<p>“…User?”</p>
<p>‘What is that?’</p>
<p>I widened my eyes and activated my Gift, [Observation and Reading].</p>
<p>[User — ID GreasyPaper]</p>
<p>[Play time 7236 hours]</p>
<p>“Why is there a user here…?”</p>
<p>Suddenly a realization struck me as if I had been hit by a hammer in the head. The idea that crossed my mind gave me goosebumps.</p>
<p>“Mm. I see a couple of people over there. They don’t look hostile to me.”</p>
<p>Even Cheok Jungyeong’s voice sounded distant.</p>
<p>I began to think.</p>
<p>Just like PC cafes, the capsules at [Capsule de Mars] used a shared public network. And at that time the number of customers at the cafe were well over 1000.</p>
<p>Then, maybe, when I connected the flash drive to the capsule, everyone at the cafe….</p>
<p>“Uh, wait, I think we have a huge problem.”</p>
<p>I scratched the back of my neck.</p>
<p>In addition to the ‘user’ marker, the information about ‘play time 7236 hours’… if that sentence was true, then it meant there was a problem with the time axis.</p>
<p>“Uh, I—”</p>
<p>I was only now realizing the scale of the disaster I had caused.</p>
<p>I got up, crumpling my hair.</p>
<p>“…Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“You see those people over there?”</p>
<p>“Ya want me to catch them?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong grinned and I shaked my head.</p>
<p>“No, don’t catch, just politely ask them to-”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong was already racing across the field like a beast before I even finished speaking.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[A motel in Suwon Area A]</p>
<p>It was early in the morning, the sky glowing in dim blue. Soon the sun would rise, yet the atmosphere inside the motel was still dreary.</p>
<p>“I have to leave… I have to leave….”</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was scratching at the wall in agony, while Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah were sighing at the thought of the 3rd preliminary round that was to begin 3 days later, and Shin Jonghak was consoling Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun couldn’t face her friends. She still wasn’t sure what caused this situation, but it was her who pushed them to play this game.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun let out another sigh. Suddenly her gaze drifted to Yi Jiyoon who was still in front of the computer.</p>
<p>“Jiyoon, did you find anything?”</p>
<p>“…Mm? Oh, no. I’m just looking at blogs and stuff.”</p>
<p>“Ah… yeah?”</p>
<p>‘Blog. So she’s just killing time.’</p>
<p>As she heaved another sigh, Chae Nayun suddenly remembered something. An electric shock shot through her body and she widened her eyes.</p>
<p>Blog.</p>
<p>A long time ago, the words that her precious person had said to her, they still lingered in her heart.</p>
<p>—I’m gonna take lots of pictures of you and your brother and post them on my blog.</p>
<p>She could hear that voice clearly.</p>
<p>“Ah—!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun jumped to her feet and ran to Yi Jiyoon.</p>
<p>“Show me. Show me!”</p>
<p>“You scared me. What’s the big deal…?”</p>
<p>“Just, show me.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun saw the blog site on the computer screen.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and rubbed her temples.</p>
<p>‘What was mom’s ID again?’</p>
<p>She buried her head in her hands.</p>
<p>‘Think…!’</p>
<p>“Ah! Bellflower!”</p>
<p>“Huh? What’s Bellflower-”</p>
<p>“It’s an ID! Quick, search Bellflower!”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon tilted her head in confusion but did as she was told. There was only one user with the nickname ‘Bellflower’.</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon clicked on the link to her blog without a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Right then, Chae Nayun’s heart stopped. So did Yi Jiyoon’s.</p>
<p>“This is….”</p>
<p>A streak of tears trickled down Chae Nayun’s cheek.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Chae Nayun, Yi Jiyoon?”</p>
<p>The rest of the party began to gather around the computer as well. The first to come was Shin Jonghak, then Kim Suho, Yun Seung-Ah, and lastly, Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>All of them fell silent when they saw what was on the computer screen.</p>
<p>Their reaction was inevitable.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>[Bellflower] [●Currently online]</p>
<p>[Blog of eternal happiness. I write about my son.]</p>
<p>Bellflower’s blog— it was full of photos of young Chae Jinyoon.</p>
<p>“Ah…,” Chae Nayun muttered in a daze. Tears flowed down from her eyes and a sad smile spread across her lips.</p>
<p>“…They’re alive.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and everyone else looked at Chae Nayun. Shin Jonghak stretched his arm out towards Chae Nayun but Yoo Yeonha stopped him.</p>
<p>“My mom, and my brother too.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah, who was standing next to Chae Nayun, pulled her junior into her arms. Chae Nayun stared at the photo of her mom and her brother smiling together, her head resting on Yun Seung-Ah’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hey Jiyoon, does this have a live chat feature?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh yeah, wait a sec….”</p>
<p>But their peace did not last long.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaak—</em></p>
<p>Silver wires danced quietly just outside the motel windows. The wires shattered the windows in a swift motion and spread throughout the room.</p>
<p>“What the.”</p>
<p>The party quickly grabbed their weapons, but it was too late.</p>
<p>“Shh. Don’t move. This is a game, not reality. If you move I’ll have no choice but to take your life.”</p>
<p>A threatening voice struck their ears and the sharp wire stopped just in front of their necks.</p>
<p>“…This.”</p>
<p>But Kim Suho had seen these silver wires before.</p>
<p>He clenched his teeth and glared at the shattered window. A man covered with a robe from head to toe was leaning against the window frame.</p>
<p>“You’re….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho knew this man. His eyes and his build was more than familiar.</p>
<p>They had been enemies since they first met at the Tower of Wish.</p>
<p>‘Silver Kaita’ was the only person who used steel wires as his main weapon.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>Kaita smirked. The marker [User] was floating above Kaita’s head.</p>
<p>“…Are you the one behind all of this?”</p>
<p>Kaita shrugged at Kim Suho’s threatening gaze.</p>
<p>“No. See, I have no idea what’s going on either, so don’t glare at me like that. After all, I’m only here to help. You guys don’t even know what this game is about, right?”</p>
<p><em>Tap— Tap—</em></p>
<p>“FYI, there are at least 1500 other users here besides you and me. There are 300 in Suwon, and about 50 of them were after you guys until just now,” Kaita explained. He then sat on the nearest bed and continued, “But all 50 of them ran away because of me! I helped you guys out, do you understand? Now stop with those faces.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak, Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, Yoo Yeonha, Yun Seung-Ah, Yi Jiyoon.</p>
<p>At the center of the six Heroes’ ferocious gaze, Kaita smirked.</p>
<p>“I’ll take that as a no. Shall we continue the conversation in this state then?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 313. The Virtual Reality Containing Truth (4)</p>
<p>[A motel in Suwon Area A]</p>
<p>“First of all, I don’t know why I’m here either.”</p>
<p>Kaita continued his explanation in the motel room full of wires. He was telling the truth, but his audience found him untrustworthy as evidenced by the look on their faces.</p>
<p>Kaita shrugged, feeling somewhat helpless.</p>
<p>“It’s true. I’m too great to be stuck in this shabby past.”</p>
<p>“…Why don’t you free us first?” Kim Suho suggested. He seemed calm as opposed to Shin Jonghak who was still struggling to find his way out of the wires.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Kaita nodded. “Fine. But only you.”</p>
<p><em>Tak—!</em></p>
<p>Kaita snapped his fingers. Of the countless wires that covered the room, only those that had bound Kim Suho were sucked back into Kaita’s gauntlet.</p>
<p>Kim Suho stood straight and looked around.</p>
<p>The silver wires stretched like a spiderweb.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Kim Suho would’ve easily destroyed these wires… but here, inside virtual reality, he found it difficult to control his magic power.</p>
<p>“…Secondly, you guys were pretty lucky,” Kaita continued, “I’ve lost count of how many damn years I’ve spent in this fake world. But you, you only just got here, no?”</p>
<p>“…What are you talking about? The time of arrival is different for everyone?” Kim Suho asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Apparently the time outside flows much slower than the time inside. It took me two years to figure that out. Other people say this whole situation has something to do with brain science, virtual reality, dimensional systems, blah blah blah… but I really couldn’t care less.”</p>
<p>Kaita sat on his wires. With a smirk, he said, “Would you like to work together?”</p>
<p>“…Work together?” Kim Suho frowned in confusion. That really didn’t sound like something Kaita would say, which led Kim Suho to doubt Kaita’s intentions again.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I just wanna get the fuck out of this place as fast as I can. I’m sick and tired of idiots who’d settle for a fake world. I’d kill them all if I could.”</p>
<p>Immediately, <em>chwaaak—!</em> Kaita withdrew all his wires.</p>
<p>Freed at last, the party took a minute to calm down, then shifted their attention to Kaita and Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent, trying to figure out what to say.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was the first to break the silence.</p>
<p>“We’d have to hear more, but…” She smiled at Kaita and asked, “You’re a member of the Chameleon Troupe, no?”</p>
<p>“…Hm? You shouldn’t mention that name so casually.”</p>
<p>Kaita was obviously disgruntled but Yoo Yeonha didn’t falter. She knew that no matter how heinous the Chameleon Troupe might be, they were fundamentally a group of thieves. And, she could always bring up ‘Black Lotus’ if things took a turn for the worse….</p>
<p>“Anyway, we need more information. About this world and how to escape from it. We’ll cooperate if we find it necessary, is what I’m saying.”</p>
<p>‘The time outside flows much slower than the time inside.’</p>
<p>Thanks to this crucial piece of information, Yoo Yeonha had regained her usual confidence.</p>
<p>Kaita nodded with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Okay, but I’m only gonna say this once, so listen carefully….”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[An office building on the outskirts of Seoul]</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and I left the church. With the two friends(?) we met at the church, we moved to our new base, an abandoned office building near Boss’s nursery.</p>
<p>“Clean this place up, and it’ll be decent enough for us to use for the next couple of days.”</p>
<p>The building had three floors, each about 640 sq ft. It was full of spiderwebs and mold, but I was fully satisfied.</p>
<p>“…It’s too damn filthy to clean properly.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong, on the other hand, looked irritated.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, he was quite strict about hygiene.</p>
<p>“It’ll only take about an hour.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me… Hyung-nims?”</p>
<p>At that moment, one of our new friends spoke. They had been beaten so badly that if was hard to tell who was who by their faces. But their hairstyles were different, so I had no problem distinguishing them. One had a mohawk and the other had a shag.</p>
<p>“What do you… plan on doing from now on?” Mohawk asked carefully.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” I answered softly. As the one responsible for the current situation, I couldn’t be harsh on them.</p>
<p>In my defense, it was Cheok Jungyeong who beat them up, not me.</p>
<p>“What have you two been doing up until now?”</p>
<p>“We were… just trying to survive. Our base is ‘GTA’.”</p>
<p>“Base? GTA?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t understand what they were saying. Cheok Jungyeong and I frowned at the same time.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our friends were quick-witted.</p>
<p>“Oh, your ‘base’ refers to the game you were playing when you first got dragged into this world. Our base is ‘Grand Theft Auto’.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… could you explain from the top? From the very beginning?”</p>
<p>“…Ah, of course,” Mohawk answered, “So, about 300 days ago, wait, is it 300? Anyway, we were playing a game at a capsule cafe in Paris….”</p>
<p>…They had been playing ‘Grand Theft Auto XS’ at Capsule de Mars when they suddenly received a system message saying [You have been disconnected from the game]. They immediately lost consciousness, and when they opened their eyes again they were here— Korea in the 2000s. They soon found out that a game-like feature, called ‘privilege’, existed in this world.</p>
<p>However, users’ privileges depended solely on the genre of their base games. And their base was GTA, the worst possible game of all.</p>
<p>“The privileges of the GTA-based users are stealing, mugging, things of that sort. The reason we chased after that sedan was to rob them….”</p>
<p>The two friends were honest.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“So that’s our story. And… what are your bases?” Shag asked.</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh… we’re….”</p>
<p>After a moment of hesitation, I shook my head. Mohawk just told me that his base game had reduced his physical abilities and gave him certain talents called ‘privileges’.</p>
<p>But there was nothing different about the way Cheok Jungyeong moved half an hour ago. He was a little bit slower than usual but by no means weaker.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we have a base. We weren’t playing any games at the time, so our base must be reality, so to say.”</p>
<p>In other words, we came into this world without any limitations, and with full physical strength within ‘the limits of the capsule’.</p>
<p>“Wow…. Oh, but the fact that new players are coming must mean that this is an actual game that’s being hosted somewhere.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re probably wrong about that.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. It was also because of me that each user had a different time of arrival.</p>
<p>When I plugged the flash drive into the capsule, my Stigma must have spread out from me. So those who were around me arrived at a similar time frame as me, and those who were far away from me probably traveled further back in time. Cheok Jungyeong was an exception because he was a member of my party.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t tell them all this, so I decided to change the subject.</p>
<p>“So, there must be a lot of users here, then.”</p>
<p>Mohawk remarked, “Oh, no. The playable area covers half of the Korean Peninsula, but the number of users is only about a thousand or so.”</p>
<p>“Mm. And, are there different factions?”</p>
<p>This time Shag answered, “There are, but only a few are worth noting. There’s the Gladiator Union, made up of players from [Gladiator of the Century], and the Church Union, made up of players from [Holy Magical Battle]. But the strongest is Silver Flash.”</p>
<p>“…Silver Flash?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’s terrifying. Nobody knows which game his base is. He uses silver thread as his main weapon and that thread-”</p>
<p>“Silver thread?”</p>
<p>I frowned, and so did Cheok Jungyeong next to me.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a thread made of steel,” Shag confirmed.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and I looked at each other and soon broke into smiles.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing here?”</p>
<p>“I wonder.”</p>
<p>I stretched myself with a grunt.</p>
<p>The unexpected emergence of an ally—though not exactly reliable—made me feel more comfortable than before.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it’s our first day here,” I continued with a sigh, “So let’s clean this place up.”</p>
<p>Though the building was a mess, I believed an hour would be enough for us to clean this place up.</p>
<p>Right then, Cheok Jungyeong turned his gaze to my right arm and asked, “Can you do it with just one arm?”</p>
<p>“One is more than enough.”</p>
<p>“…And we’re not gonna do anything about Boss?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong’s voice was filled with worry and sympathy.</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, I held up a broom and a dustpan.</p>
<p>“We have no choice, at least for now. We’ll be extra nice to her when we return.”</p>
<p>We spent the next two hours cleaning the office. It was definitely hard not being able to use one arm, but thanks to the help of our friends, we finished quickly.</p>
<p>“I appreciate your help.”</p>
<p>“No problem. And like we said, you can talk comfortably around us.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shag and Mohawk had become our loyal supporters. They seemed to have realized instinctively—or through Cheok Jungyeong—that their chances of survival would be better with us.</p>
<p>“Then, could you go outside and get us something to eat? Maybe a pot and a burner, too. I’m a bit hungry.”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“We’re on it!”</p>
<p>Just like that, the two friends left, and I looked outside the window. It was already dinner time, and the burning glow of the sunset poured in through the window.</p>
<p>It was then that Cheok Jungyeong asked, “So, do you know how to get out of here?”</p>
<p>I nodded with a smile and said, “I do.”</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“It’s simple.”</p>
<p>The way to log out was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>The moment I got dragged into the virtual world, the co-author sent me a message. I just discovered it a bit late because I was unconscious when I first received it.</p>
<p>According to the co-author:</p>
<p>[This is a message from the co-author to you, who I assume will be very confused]</p>
<p>[This is a side arc, a phase in which we take a closer look at Boss’s past.]</p>
<p>[Therefore, the logout feature will be reinstated once you observe at least one of the ‘events’ that Yoo Jinhyuk has prepared for you.]</p>
<p>[Try your best to witness the events.]</p>
<p>And the very first ‘event’ was to take place today.</p>
<p>I read over Yoo Jinhyuk’s message I just received.</p>
<p>=Yoo Jinhyuk’s message=</p>
<p>[Tonight at 9 PM, track down the parents of the girl.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“After we witness the relationship between Yi Yeonjun and Boss, we’ll be able to return to the outside world.”</p>
<p>The event that Yoo Jinhyuk wants me to see— Once I witness it, this world would cease to exist.</p>
<p>Of course, there was a possibility that something could go wrong if the users intervened, but that was unlikely. I even had Cheok Jungyeong by my side, after all.</p>
<p>“Their relationship?”</p>
<p>"Yes. It's five o'clock now, so we'll just have to wait four more hours."</p>
<p>“…Yeah?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong nodded nonchalantly and slumped down on the floor next to me.</p>
<p><em>Kooong—</em></p>
<p>Even the simple act of sitting down was loud for a giant like him.</p>
<p>Slouched on the floor together, we looked up at the sunset outside the window.</p>
<p>Soon Mohawk and Shag returned with food and a burner.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Later that day, we were chasing Boss’s parents like we had been told to do by Yoo Jinhyuk. Their expensive sedan drove smoothly across the highway and we ran after it. Mohawk and Shag were following us on a motorcycle.</p>
<p>“Look, they’re stopping.”</p>
<p>An hour flew by.</p>
<p>Boss’s parents arrived at a building in Seoul. They drove down to the underground parking lot, and Cheok Jungyeong frowned.</p>
<p>“Do we need to follow them down there?”</p>
<p>“No, let’s not take a risk and watch them from here.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t see them from here.”</p>
<p>“I can.”</p>
<p>“…What good is that for me?”</p>
<p>“Shh—”</p>
<p>I calmed Cheok Jungyeong down and opened my eyes wide.</p>
<p>‘Master Sharpshooter’ seemed to work in this world, and I could see through the walls of the building.</p>
<p>Boss’s parents parked their car and took the elevator to the top floor.</p>
<p>Ding—</p>
<p>The elevator door opened, and there was a man in a robe in the penthouse where they arrived.</p>
<p>I recognized this man right away. I’d seen him many times before— it was Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>Boss’s parents approached Yi Yeonjun with a big smile.</p>
<p>—We’re back, Elder.</p>
<p>They bowed to Yi Yeonjun, calling him ‘Elder’.</p>
<p>But at the next moment, Yi Yeonjun, without even a simple greeting, said something very cruel to them.</p>
<p>—…!</p>
<p>The parents froze in shock.</p>
<p>But they soon regained their composure and nodded, as if they had heard him say this before as if they had been preparing for this day to come.</p>
<p>I clenched my fists. And my teeth. My heart started racing.</p>
<p>…Soon, I received another message.</p>
<p>=Yoo Jinhyuk’s message=</p>
<p>[At first, the girl’s parents were faithful devotees and benevolent philanthropists.]</p>
<p>[They tried to understand their daughter’s dark powers.]</p>
<p>[But Yi Yeonjun brainwashed them. His lies and schemes led the couple to believe that their daughter’s powers were, in fact, a curse.]</p>
<p>[He ruined her family.]</p>
<p>[And today, Yi Yeonjun ordered the couple to kill their daughter.]</p>
<p>[Yi Yeonjun realized the girl’s huge potential and planned all this just to win her trust.]</p>
<p>[The couple will now try to murder their daughter as instructed, and you’ll soon witness the consequences of their actions.]</p>
<p>[Now, please watch until the end.]</p>
<p>「Nothing is impossible — Yoo Jinhyuk, Investigator」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A cruel story like this wasn’t in my original setting.</p>
<p>—We’ll get rid of her today.</p>
<p>The couple answered, and I swallowed a sigh. The breath traveled down my throat and mingled with rage. I disheveled my hair with trembling hands.</p>
<p>“…Cheok Jungyeong.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong responded nonchalantly.</p>
<p>With my eyes still fixed on the building, I announced, “Looks like we might have to kill someone.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boss’s parents traveled down to the parking lot and got in their car.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun just told them, ‘It’s time to kill that child.’</p>
<p>They would now go back to their daughter to carry out his orders.</p>
<p>“Will you help me?”</p>
<p>“…Sure, why not?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong nodded casually.</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Really. You’ve always been right. I believe in you.”</p>
<p>At that moment, I saw the couple’s sedan leave the building.</p>
<p>“Let’s follow them.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>We put our hoods on and chased after the car.</p>
<p><em>Wooong—</em></p>
<p>The car moved with the roaring sound of the engine.</p>
<p>We ran after it.</p>
<p>And, <em>chwaak—!</em></p>
<p>A silver wire stretched out from the right side of the road and twisted around the sedan.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>It was sudden. We stopped in surprise.</p>
<p><em>KOOONG!</em></p>
<p>The wire crushed the car and slammed it against the ground.</p>
<p><em>KWAAANG—!</em> The vehicle, thrown upside down on the ground, exploded.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>After the devastating car accident, silence filled the air.</p>
<p>I might have thought this was what actually happened in the past if it wasn’t for what happened next.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man fell from the sky.</p>
<p>“What the… What’s he doing?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong chuckled in disbelief.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe’s Seat of Silver, ‘Kaita’ gracefully landed on the destroyed car. With a smile, he withdrew his wire. Then he leaned into the car seat and started whispering….</p>
<p>“Oi—!”</p>
<p>It was then that Cheok Jungyeong’s thunderous cry rang out.</p>
<p>Startled, Kaita turned to us and widened his eyes. In a daze, he muttered, “Cheok Jungyeong, and… you too, Black?”</p>
<p>Because he called me ‘Black’, I knew this Kaita was from the present era.</p>
<p>“Yup, it’s me. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>However, as Cheok Jungyeong approached Kaita….</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAANG—!</em></p>
<p>A magic power explosion occurred at Yi Yeonjun’s building which we just left.</p>
<p>This magic power wasn’t pure but made up of multiple magic powers. The sudden explosion caused Cheok Jungyeong and me to look back in surprise.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 314. Virtual Reality Containing the Truth (5)</p>
<p>After three years of rigorous researching, Kaita discovered the way to escape from this virtual reality that was the perfect reproduction of Korea’s past.</p>
<p>The solution was complicated yet simple. He had to destroy the ‘core’ that was the center of this world.</p>
<p>The core could be a person, a location, or an object, but Kaita knew for a fact that it was a person thanks to his base game, ‘Isekai Dating Simulator’.</p>
<p>Kaita’s privilege were ‘eyes’ that could identify the [Importance] and the [Level of Difficulty] of the people of this world. Because his base game was set in an isekai world, his initial physical ability was also better than most people.</p>
<p>In any case, using his privilege, Kaita found someone he thought could be the core of this world.</p>
<p>His importance was [Incalculable] and his level of difficulty was [Near Impossible].</p>
<p>His entire existence was screaming that he was the ‘core’. But he was someone Kaita knew in the present era, someone he lived with for a long time, someone Kaita regarded as his savior— Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>Kaita hesitated. Even in the virtual world, he couldn’t bring himself to murder his own savior. Another reason for his hesitation was that Yi Yeonjun was too strong for Kaita to handle alone.</p>
<p>So, he decided to watch Yi Yeonjun from afar while diligently training his powers.</p>
<p>However, as the observation prolonged, Kaita realized that Yi Yeonjun was not the person Kaita thought he was.</p>
<p>He began to feel betrayed.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe also existed in this world. They were a group of vicious criminals who used violence to get their hands on what they wanted. And their cruelty was well within the realm of Kaita’s understanding. He too grew up surrounded by blood, violence, and death.</p>
<p>But what Kaita couldn’t understand was the way Yi Yeonjun treated Boss. Yi Yeonjun destroyed Boss’s family just because he wanted her for himself. He sought to control Boss’s life.</p>
<p>Seeing Yi Yeonjun carry out such a terrifying and heinous scheme like it was nothing made Kaita wonder if Boss really was his only victim.</p>
<p>He had always thought that his meeting with Yi Yeonjun was fate. But maybe, their encounter had also been prearranged.</p>
<p>Kaita recalled when he was 11 years old. Someone forcefully injected a drug into his veins. He still remembered the rush he felt while he was high and killing people. His life changed that day.</p>
<p>Was that really just a matter of luck?</p>
<p>…Kaita pondered for three years. Maybe this world was fabricated. He spent many nights wondering if all this was just part of a scheme designed to turn him against Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>But in the end, the truth was clear, and Kaita decided to kill Yi Yeonjun and escape from this world.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as he was preparing to strike Yi Yeonjun, he gained a number of dependable allies: Kim Suho, Yun Seung-Ah, and other Heroes.</p>
<p>For two months Kaita helped them regain their original strength. The Heroes gladly cooperated with Kaita, for they hoped to escape from this fake world, too.</p>
<p>And today was the day they would carry out the plan….</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAANG—!</em></p>
<p>A magic power explosion erupted at the building Yi Yeonjun just left. This magic power wasn’t pure but made up of multiple magic powers, and Cheok Jungyeong and I looked back in surprise.</p>
<p>Some people were climbing the building towards the top floor where Yi Yeonjun was located. I recognized the climbers right away. Kim Suho, Yun Seung-Ah, Chae Nayun, Shin Jonghak… I knew all of them.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong watched them for a while before turning his gaze back to Kaita.</p>
<p>“Oi, what the hell are you doing?”</p>
<p>Finally having regained his composure, Kaita answered with a sigh, “…Can’t you tell? I’m trying to go back to the real world.”</p>
<p>“But why did ya have to go and destroy that building?”</p>
<p>I left them to talk and ran towards the car. I pushed my head into the car, but no one was there. Boss’s parents had already turned into digital fragments and disappeared forever.</p>
<p>“…Haa. Why did it have to be today?”</p>
<p>I ruffled my hair and glared at Kaita.</p>
<p>Of course, I already had a good idea about how this story would end. The couple was planning on killing their daughter, but the girl would survive and become Boss…. Perhaps it was for the best that I didn’t see it through.</p>
<p>Kaita said, “Even in a fake world, some things can’t be forgiven.”</p>
<p>His voice sounded surprisingly dignified, and I realized Kaita somehow found out the truth about Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I looked at Kaita. Kaita also looked at me and nodded. It was a silent conversation, which Cheok Jungyeong was not a part of.</p>
<p>Scratching the back of my neck, I asked, “How long have you been here, Kaita?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Three years? Four years?”</p>
<p>I pointed at the penthouse.</p>
<p>“How about them?”</p>
<p>“Two months.”</p>
<p><em>KWAAAANG—!</em> Magic power exploded once again.</p>
<p>“Do you think two months of training is enough? I heard there’s something called a ‘privilege’ in this world.”</p>
<p>I asked worriedly.</p>
<p>Kaita, however, remarked with a confident smile, “Don’t underestimate them.”</p>
<p>It was then. <em>Clang—!</em> A giant sword pierced the ceiling of the penthouse. The sword was so big that it seemed capable of splitting the sky into two. It was Chae Nayun’s longsword, wrapped in magic power.</p>
<p>“All six of them are pretty damn strong.”</p>
<p>This time, golden magic power flashed in the distance. It was Kim Suho’s reinforced sword qi.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—</em></p>
<p>His reinforced sword qi traveled forward, cutting off all the light in the area, thereby wrapping the world in complete darkness for a moment.</p>
<p>“We may be inside virtual reality, but our real base is our own body,” Kaita commented.</p>
<p>It was then that Shin Jonghak’s black flames rose into the air. Kim Suho slices everything, but Shin Jonghak destroys and burns. The fire engulfed the building, swallowing it as a whole. It was a terrifying scene.</p>
<p>“Two months. It took them only two months to achieve that when it took me over a year to regain my original strength.”</p>
<p><em>Clang….</em> This time, clear lightning blossomed like a flower. It was Yun Seung-Ah’s white flowers, a graceful technique she used to incapacitate her opponents.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak, Chae Nayun, Yun Seung-Ah, Kim Suho.</p>
<p>These four were among the strongest characters in this novel. Perhaps even Yi Yeonjun wouldn’t be able to last long against all four of them.</p>
<p>“…Amazing.”</p>
<p>It didn’t look like they needed any help.</p>
<p>I stood in place and watched them move.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>=System Alert=</p>
<p>[The execution of an event was interrupted. An error has occurred.]</p>
<p>[We’ll test the system to identify and fix the problem.]</p>
<p>[If no solution is found, your session will be terminated by force.]</p>
<p>[Running diagnostics….]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Several system alerts popped up.</p>
<p>“Hyung-nims! What happened here?!”</p>
<p>“Uwaaaa, it’s coming down, it’s coming down…!”</p>
<p>Mohawk and Shag finally arrived at the scene. They trembled in fear at the clash of magic power unfolding before their eyes.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>It was past midnight and the night sky was dyed deep blue.</p>
<p>Mohawk, Shag, Cheok Jungyeong and I returned to our office. I sent Kaita back to Kim Suho and the others, hoping he could serve as a messenger between us when necessary.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you all hungry? Let’s eat.”</p>
<p>I started cooking with one arm using the ingredients that Mohawk and Shag brought earlier.</p>
<p>I chopped the ingredients into small pieces with a knife, threw them into a pan with some seasoning and began to stir. Meanwhile, Cheok Jungyeong gathered Shag and Mohawk.</p>
<p>“Is anyone bothering you?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“You just tell me if anyone’s bothering you. I’ll crush them for ya.”</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you!”</p>
<p><em>Tzzzt—</em></p>
<p>Even with just one arm, it took me only 10 minutes to cook.</p>
<p>“It’s all done. Let’s eat.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank y- Wow, look at all this!”</p>
<p>After preparing beef steak, stir-fried pork and other delicacies, I leaned against the window frame. Looking up at the moon in the sky, my thoughts drifted to Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>Today, Kim Suho and the others killed Yi Yeonjun. His death was much too insipid for the notorious founder of the Chameleon Troupe… or not. The combined forces of Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Yun Seung-Ah. Only Orden and Chae Joochul could counter them.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun’s death, however, was just fictional. He was still alive in the outside world, scheming like a snake beside Boss. Boss still didn’t know it was him who ruined her life….</p>
<p><em>Keung, Keung—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard a sound from below.</p>
<p><em>Keung, Keung—</em></p>
<p>Somebody was sniffing. I looked down and froze.</p>
<p>There was a little girl. She was scruffy and skinny as if she hadn’t eaten for a long time. Perhaps, she was looking for her parents who would never again come home.</p>
<p>Did she come all this way just to find her parents?</p>
<p>I looked at the girl and sighed.</p>
<p>This world was fictional.</p>
<p>Nothing I do here would matter in the future.</p>
<p>But in my hands was a plate of leftover food, and I jumped to the ground below.</p>
<p>“…Hello,” I spoke carefully.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The girl flinched and took a step back. Dark magic power began to rise out of the girl. It was a powerful but dangerous power, one that she couldn’t control yet.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. This is for you to eat.”</p>
<p>I wanted to calm her down, but the more I spoke, the further she got away from me.</p>
<p>Young Boss was different from adult Boss who was always so full of confidence. If I went any closer, the girl would run away and never come back.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>And so, I set the plate down on the ground and left a note beside it that said [Come back anytime if you’re hungry].</p>
<p>Then I returned to the office.</p>
<p>Mohawk and Shag saw me and shouted out loud.</p>
<p>“Wow, this stuff is amazing, boss. Wow!”</p>
<p>“We love you, boss!”</p>
<p>They were calling me ‘boss’ now.</p>
<p>I smiled at them, then leaned against the window and looked below.</p>
<p>—…Keung.</p>
<p>Yi Byul was sniffing the food on the plate.</p>
<p>I knew for a fact that smell was very hard to resist.</p>
<p>—…Keung. Gulp.</p>
<p>She continued to sniff for a while, then took a quick look around and snatched the food from the plate.</p>
<p>—…Nom, nom nom.</p>
<p>The way she hid behind the bushes and stuffed her face made her seem like a small animal rather than a human.</p>
<p>It was heartbreaking to see her like that. The extent of the pain was strangely enormous. My heart ached for her.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Was it sympathy I was feeling? Was sympathy supposed to be this heart-throbbing?</p>
<p>Suddenly I wanted to see Boss. The six years I spent with her were now overlapping with the little girl before my eyes.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>I let out a sigh. Then a chuckle.</p>
<p>If this feeling was truly what I think it was, then what should I do from now on? Nothing was stranger than falling in love with a character I had created….</p>
<p>—Tiriring.</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard a notification sound.</p>
<p>=System Alert=</p>
<p>[Unable to resolve the error. Rewind feature has been disabled due to an unknown reason.]</p>
<p>[The interrupted event will play as a video.]</p>
<p>[Logout feature has been reinstated.]</p>
<p>A rectangular hologram screen appeared before me. In it, the events of the original past were playing.</p>
<p>—Kuaaaaak.</p>
<p>The parents who had to kill their child.</p>
<p>The child who had no choice but to kill her own parents to survive.</p>
<p>Painful cries and the sound of blood spurting rang out.</p>
<p>I clenched my teeth as I watched Boss’s past. It was much more horrifying than I had imagined. I tried my best to suppress my anger.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>It was then that I felt a certain gaze. I looked down and discovered Yi Byul looking at me.</p>
<p>She held an empty plate in her hands. It appeared that she wanted to return it to me. I smiled and whispered, “Tell me if you’re still hungry. I’ll give you more.”</p>
<p>—…!</p>
<p>However, at that moment, Yi Byul trembled, put the plate down on the ground and began to run away from me.</p>
<p>I watched her go, then checked the System.</p>
<p>[247 hours and 30 minutes left until logout]</p>
<p>247 hours and 30 minutes. That was roughly 10 days.</p>
<p>For the next 10 days, Yi Byul would come back to me again and again. She would never forget the taste of my cooking.</p>
<p>“…She’s cute.”</p>
<p>Clearly full, she even burped while running.</p>
<p>With a smile, I watched little Boss disappear in small steps.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Meanwhile.</p>
<p>At Kaita’s hideout, a luxurious mansion somewhere in Seoul.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap, tapap—</em></p>
<p>[He’s so cute ㅋㅋ How can a kid be so handsome?]</p>
<p>After successfully completing the mission, Chae Nayun was currently on the computer, exchanging private messages with a blogger.</p>
<p>[Bellflower: ㅎㅎ Thanks, as always.]</p>
<p>Their exchange had been going on for two months.</p>
<p>It was a conversation between Chae Nayun and her mother, ‘Bellflower’.</p>
<p>[I can totally tell he’s gonna be a great Hero in the future. ㅋㅋ]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Ah! How did you know that my son has a Gift?]</p>
<p>[I can tell by his face. He just looks special~]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Wow… interesting. I really do hope he becomes as great a Hero as you said.]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s eyes were filling with tears as she typed.</p>
<p>[So is Jinyoon going to Agent Military Academy soon?]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: No. He’s talented, but I want him to attend a regular school until he’s at least 11.]</p>
<p>[I see… ㅋㅋ]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stopped her fingers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Chae Nayun didn’t exist in this world yet. With a small sigh, she resumed typing.</p>
<p>[Oh, I hope I’m not being rude, but do you maybe plan on having another baby?]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Of course~ I’ve already thought of a name.]</p>
<p>Her heart sank immediately. Chae Nayun forced her hands to stop trembling and continued to type.</p>
<p>[Do you want the baby to be a girl or a boy?]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Hmm… I don’t know. I’ll love them the same no matter what.]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: But for some reason, I keep thinking it’s gonna be a girl. It’s strange, I’m not even pregnant yet~]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun breathed a sigh of relief. So, her mother wasn’t disappointed that she was a girl.</p>
<p>[Then… have you thought of her name?]</p>
<p>At that moment, someone put his hand on Chae Nayun’s shoulder. Surprised, Chae Nayun raised her head. Shin Jonghak was looking at her with a worried look.</p>
<p>“…Are you sure you don’t wanna go visit her?”</p>
<p>With a small smile, Chae Nayun shook her head.</p>
<p>“No. This is enough.”</p>
<p>Somewhere in this world, her mother was alive, as beautiful and gentle as she was in the real world.</p>
<p>But because she didn’t know what to say to her mother, and because just watching her from afar might make her break down, Chae Nayun decided to settle for online chatting.</p>
<p>“How about you? Don’t you have anyone you want to see?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Pfft. Liar~”</p>
<p>“It’s true. Something like virtual reality can’t create the person I admire.”</p>
<p>His tone sounded sincere. Just like he said, Shin Myungchul did not exist in this world. He wasn’t someone a mere virtual world could replicate.</p>
<p>“…Yeah?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun nodded.</p>
<p>At that moment, she received a reply from Bellflower.</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Name? Hmm… I do have a name for a girl… but I wonder if it’s okay for me to tell you this…]</p>
<p>[Oh, you don’t have to if you’re uncomfortable.]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: No, it’s fine. I’ll tell you because you’re special, Jajanggirl-nim. If I have a girl…]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun swallowed her saliva. The computer screen glowed in blue.</p>
<p>Heavy tension filled the atmosphere, and…</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
<p>With a cheerful sound, Bellflower’s reply came, and Shin Jonghak’s lips curved into a soft smile as he read the message.</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Nayun(娜允)]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: It means ‘true beauty’. Isn’t it pretty?]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 315. Demon Realm Gate (1)</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Nayun(娜允)]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: It means ‘true beauty’. Isn’t it pretty?]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun let out a deep sigh. Bitterness rose up from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>True beauty.</p>
<p>She didn’t think it suited her, an empty shell who lost everything.</p>
<p>[Yes, it’s pretty.]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun wanted to end the conversation.</p>
<p>[Bellfower: I want my child to be beautiful just the way she is.]</p>
<p>But Bellflower’s messages continued.</p>
<p>[Bellflower: She might fall and get hurt, but I want her to overcome everything in the end.]</p>
<p>Just looking at the messages stung Chae Nayun’s heart, but she couldn’t find it in herself to look away. She pushed her hair back and grumbled.</p>
<p>[How is that beautiful? That’s just not knowing when to give up.]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: You’re right. To me, true beauty isn’t weak or feeble but strong and tenacious.]</p>
<p>At that moment, Chae Nayun’s fingers paused.</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Being hurt, regretting, and grieving but also accepting that pain and sadness as a part of her.]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Accepting herself and standing up on her two feet as a person…]</p>
<p>Her mother’s voice, the same one she remembered from years past, seemed to flow into her ears through the messages.</p>
<p>[Bellflower: That’s what Nayun means to me.]</p>
<p>“…I’m heading out.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak read the mood and took a leave. Chae Nayun wiped the tears glistening around here eyes and typed.</p>
<p>[I’ll remember that.]</p>
<p>She knew she was in a fake world, but she decided to believe anyways. She decided to remember the meaning of her name and hold onto it.</p>
<p>[Always.]</p>
<p>Of course, that didn’t mean her outlook on life would change overnight. Her memories of Kim Hajin, Chae Jinyoon’s death, Chae Joochul’s sins… it was hard to accept all of them. She would likely repeat her doubts and justifications.</p>
<p>But she would also repeatedly think about the meaning of the name she learned today. And eventually, one day, before her death, it might truly change.</p>
<p>[I have something to attend to. Thank you.]</p>
<p>[Bellflower: Ah, okay. Let’s talk later. ^^]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun ended the conversation and turned off her computer.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha then appeared at the perfect timing.</p>
<p>“You’re done chatting?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun got up with a short reply. Yoo Yeonha was startled when she saw Chae Nayun’s face and then smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Looks like you received a good piece of advice.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, no, it’s nothing like that.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun shook her head and went out to the living room with Yoo Yeonha. Her comrades were gathered inside the large penthouse living room surrounded by walls of glass.</p>
<p>“Why can’t we logout? You lied to us, didn’t you?!”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah was complaining to Kaita, while Kim Suho greeted Chae Nayun with a smile.</p>
<p>“Would I be here if I was lying? Just wait ten days…”</p>
<p>Walking past the arguing Kaita and Yun Seung-Ah, Chae Nayun sat down on the couch. A cool breeze blew in from the open window, gently caressing her hair.</p>
<p>Feeling the peaceful atmosphere, Chae Nayun stared at her comrades. Then, she slowly opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Guys.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes turned to Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun let out a small breath, as if in thought, then finally smiled beautifully, like a huge burden had been lifted off her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go meet Mom and Oppa.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[D-6 Until Logout]</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong went to work with Shag and Mohawk first thing in the morning. He left for the mountains, knowing that the mountains of the 2000s were full of hidden experts.</p>
<p>Repeatedly fighting strong opponents. Cheok Jungyeong was enjoying a happy daily life, and it was Shag and Mohawk’s duty to bare witness to his tales of battle.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I selected a more peaceful lifestyle.</p>
<p>“This is the flower you like?”</p>
<p>Byul nodded from next to me. In her hand were two yellow flowers. I checked the name of the flower with Observation and Reading.</p>
<p>[Evening Primrose]</p>
<p>“Evening primrose?”</p>
<p>“…?” But Byul only tilted her head. From the looks of it, she didn’t know the name of the flower either.</p>
<p>“That’s the name of this flower. If you didn’t know before, now you do.”</p>
<p>I stretched and got up. I played ball with her for an hour, read her a fairy tale for an hour, and went flower-hunting for an hour. It was time to go eat.</p>
<p>“Let’s go get dinner now.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Byul nodded while keeping a three-step distance between us. Although she was just as expressionless as before, I could tell from the four-days I spent with her that this was her reaction when she was extremely happy. The way the corner of her mouth twitched a bit was an easy sign.</p>
<p>“Alright, follow me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Byul nodded silently and chased after me like a duckling following her mother.</p>
<p>On a side note, I purchased this orphanage four days ago to win over Byul’s heart. Kaita gave me the money for it. I didn’t know how he made his money, but he was a mogul in this world.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to lie to Byul that the reason her parents suddenly disappeared was because they abandoned her, but Byul didn’t express any shock or sorrow. She acted normal even though she must be hurt on the inside.</p>
<p>“…Oh right, what’s your favorite meal out of all the ones I’ve made so far?”</p>
<p>I asked what she liked as we walked together. This virtual world was created with an extreme synergy between Yoo Jinhyuk’s Gift and Stigma. Since Stigma’s power materialized the world of the past with the capsule and USB as its mediums, the current Boss should have the same taste in food as the young Boss.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But Byul didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>“Pasta? Pork belly?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer no matter how many times I asked.</p>
<p>“Chicken? Pizza? Candy? Dumplings?”</p>
<p>However, she stopped when she heard the words ‘dumplings’.</p>
<p>“…Dumplings?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She looked up at me silently. Looking at her sparkling eyes, I smiled.</p>
<p>“That’s unexpected.”</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, I never made Boss dumplings.</p>
<p>“Perfect, let’s go with dumplings.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Byul nodded and even walked ahead of me excitedly. The kid who always followed me from a few-step distance was now skipping over to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>I laughed and chased after Byul.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[D-2 Until Logout]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun arrived at a hanok, a traditional Korean house, on the outskirts of Seoul. It was the same house she lived in since she was little. She walked to the front gate with delight.</p>
<p>[Chae Family Hanok]</p>
<p>The nameplate written in Chinese characters looked slightly less worn down than the one she remembered. With a grin, she stood in front of the gate.</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice flowed into her ears.</p>
<p>—Hey, don’t let yourself be found out and just run. They’ll capture you and take you away if you act suspicious. You know the time they go for a stroll, so aim for that.</p>
<p>It was Kaita’s voice.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun walked away from the hanok and headed to the nearby trail. Grass, flowers, a mountain, and a stream. The trail was full of natural beauty.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun sat down at a nearby bench. She knew the exact path her mother would take in her daily stroll through the trail.</p>
<p>“Whew~”</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and felt the spiritual energy of her surroundings.</p>
<p>After about 20 minutes of waiting, Kaita’s voice rang out.</p>
<p>—She’s out. Chae Jinyoon’s with her.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun immediately tensed up with nervousness. About three minutes later, a woman and a young boy appeared in the trail hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun shot up and reiterated the sentence she prepared beforehand.</p>
<p>“Oh, isn’t it Bellflower-nim? Wow, what a coincidence, I also come here often….”</p>
<p>She practiced the line again, trying to make herself sound and look as natural as possible.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>This is it.</p>
<p>Don’t be scared.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p>These are the people who became scars in your heart because you loved them so much.</p>
<p>Walk towards them slowly.</p>
<p>With courage, Chae Nayun stepped forward.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[15 Minutes Before Logout]</p>
<p>The sky was dark. I was sitting on a chair, staring at Byul who was sleeping on the bed. She had been eating nothing but dumplings for the past week and was starting to smell like one too.</p>
<p>“…What a shame.”</p>
<p>I stayed with Byul for a week. Although Cheok Jungyeong and Kaita dropped by to see her face, Byul spent most of her time with me.</p>
<p>But a week was too short, and she never once showed me her smile.</p>
<p>[There are 10 minutes remaining until logout. The virtual reality with shut down in 10 minutes.]</p>
<p>That’s the one thing I regretted, but my time here wasn’t meaningless. After all, I got to learn Boss’s past and figure out what food she liked.</p>
<p>That was enough.</p>
<p>“…Byul.”</p>
<p>I smiled and placed my hand on Byul’s forehead. It wasn’t cold but warm.</p>
<p>[7 minutes until logout…]</p>
<p>I turned off the system alert for a moment. Then, for the remaining time, I stared at Byul.</p>
<p>1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes… time flowed without stopping.</p>
<p>4 minutes, 5 minutes, 6 minutes… I settled the bitterness in the corner of my heart.</p>
<p>Then, in the final minute…</p>
<p>“…See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I said my farewell.</p>
<p>[The virtual reality will now stop.]</p>
<p>[Forceful logout will now commence.]</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>Wooong—</em></p>
<p>The capsule opened with a hum, and I immediately looked at the clock.</p>
<p>[9:45 P.M.]</p>
<p>About three hours had passed in the real world.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>It was a truly mysterious experience. Some spent 3 or 4 years in the virtual world but only 3 hours had passed in the real world.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>In any case, I threw off the groggy feeling in my heart and came out to the hallway of the capsule room.</p>
<p><em>Woong— Woong— Woong—</em></p>
<p>I could hear other capsules opening simultaneously. I hastened my feet and stood at the exit of Capsule de Mars.</p>
<p>“You’re leaving now?”</p>
<p>Just as I was about to grab the doorknob and run, Yoo Yeonha’s voice rang out.</p>
<p>I turned my head to the side and looked at her.</p>
<p>“…You knew I was here?”</p>
<p>“I suspected as much when I saw Chameleon Troupe members in the virtual world.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“I had a good hunch as to what happened… Anyways, it was a nice healing trip for us.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha stretched with a grin. I looked at her oddly.</p>
<p>“…Healing?”</p>
<p>“Yep. For me, I didn’t have to work for two months. As for Nayun….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha paused and glanced behind her. No one had left the capsule room yet.</p>
<p>“She met her mother and older brother.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to you.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke softly and placed her hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“You can go. Looks like the others will come out soon.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha opened the door for me. I looked at her for a moment, then left.</p>
<p>Paris’s Mars Plaza filled my view. The festival in Paris wasn’t over, but there was only one thing I wanted to do right now.</p>
<p>I turned on my smartwatch and called Boss.</p>
<p>—What’s up?</p>
<p>Boss picked up immediately. I calmed my heart before opening my mouth.</p>
<p>“…Boss, are you also in Paris?”</p>
<p>—I am.</p>
<p>“Then wait for me. I’ll be right there.”</p>
<p>—Hm? Now? What—</p>
<p>I hung up then located Boss with Spartan.</p>
<p>She was eating fish cakes at a street stall.</p>
<p>I first ran to a flower shop and asked the owner if he had any evening primrose. The owner nodded his head and pointed to a flower bouquet. I quickly threw the owner money and left with the bouquet of yellow flowers.</p>
<p>Soon, I arrived at an alleyway filled with street stalls. I spotted Boss munching on fish cakes and called her with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“Boss!”</p>
<p>Boss turned back and tilted her head curiously.</p>
<p>“W-What is it so suddenly?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I stomped towards her and handed her the bouquet of flowers. Boss’s eyes widened and a question mark popped up above her head.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“A present.”</p>
<p>I shoved the bouquet into her arms. Boss furrowed her brows before nodding her head and looking at the flowers.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>In that instant, her shoulders trembled faintly. I stared at her fixedly and muttered.</p>
<p>“They’re called the evening primrose. It’s a beautiful name, right?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Boss looked up at me. Flustered, she blinked her eyes repeatedly. Looking at her, my body moved on its own.</p>
<p>I… pulled her into my embrace.</p>
<p>Our robes touched, and Boss’s forehead reached my chest. The flow of time slowed down, like Bullet Time activated on its own.</p>
<p>Boss stood frozen like a statue. I buried my face on her shoulder and whispered quietly.</p>
<p>“…I wanted to see you.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[France – Paris]</p>
<p>The third round of the selections for the Gate of Glory proceeded without any problems. A total of a thousand people would be selected. Once the fourth and final round ended, two hundred people would be chosen among the thousand to enter the Demon Realm Gate.</p>
<p>“Farewell is soon.” Bell murmured on top of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>“Yeah.” Jin Sahyuk replied, floating in the air next to him.</p>
<p>“Don’t let your personal feelings cloud your judgment. Don’t hesitate. Don’t miss the opportunity.”</p>
<p>This time, Jin Sahyuk didn’t reply to Bell. Normally, she would say something like, ‘I’ll kill you before you even have the chance to revive!’ …but now that the ‘end’ was truly in front of her, she was somewhat bitter and sad.</p>
<p>“Convince Rumi for me too.”</p>
<p>But Bell was calm and composed, just as always. He had no hesitation and no regrets.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk nodded her head silently.</p>
<p>“Good. Then I’ll see you next week.”</p>
<p><em>Tk, tk.</em> Bell tapped on Jin Sahyuk’s shoulders a couple of times before turning into a gaseous state and disappearing.</p>
<p>The top of the Eifel Tower turned silent.</p>
<p>Left alone, Jin Sahyuk let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Soon, Baal would descend from the Demon Realm Gate.</p>
<p>She would be able to return to Akatrina.</p>
<p>Wasn’t that the ending she wanted?</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>So where is this bitterness coming from?</p>
<p>Unable to figure out the answer, Jin Sahyuk created a portal and left Paris.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 316. Demon Realm Gate (2)</p>
<p>Immediately after I returned to Seoul, I began preparing for the future.</p>
<p>First, I purchased an entire block of single houses in Hannam-dong, then I began construction to renovate the basement of these houses.</p>
<p>Though the future was no longer the future I knew, if the general storyline hadn’t changed, then not much time was left until most parts of the world transformed into the Demon Realm.</p>
<p>With the help of Young Dwarf’s Dexterity, I designed the blueprint for an ‘underground city’. Then I used [Buster Call] to summon Genkelope’s Vessel. Together with Genkelope’s ‘maintenance ships’, I began the construction.</p>
<p>Because the blueprint was top notch—this was according to the ship’s crew—and because Yoo Yeonha lent me all of the equipment I needed, the assembly proceeded quickly.</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”</p>
<p>And today, I brought Boss to the construction site.</p>
<p><em>Jiing—</em> Watching a robot make parts with its laser hands, Boss widened her eyes in awe.</p>
<p>“I’m building this place to prepare for the Demon Realm Transformation.”</p>
<p>“Demon Realm Transformation?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>We needed to begin preparations to overcome the existential crisis and to achieve the happily ever after that we all deserved.</p>
<p>“This is the crystal that can stop the Transformation.”</p>
<p>I took out [Akatrina’s Purification Crystal]. It was something ‘Prihi’ from the recorded past had left to me. However, its effects were limited to a radius of 5km from the crystal.</p>
<p>“This crystal can also purify the soil and the air. With it, we can easily produce crops here in the underground.”</p>
<p>According to Horner— we could even build an ‘artificial sea’ using this crystal. If we could cultivate soil with the crystal and grow crops that could be found in the Tower of the Wish, such as [meat-flavored corn], we wouldn’t have to worry about food shortages.</p>
<p>“That’s interesting.”</p>
<p>Boss nodded.</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—</em></p>
<p>It was then that I received a video call on my smartwatch.</p>
<p>“Excuse me for a minute, Boss.”</p>
<p>The call was from Yoo Yeonha. I adjust the angle of the smartwatch so that Boss wouldn’t be seen in the screen and answered the call.</p>
<p>[Hello?]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha appeared in the air as a hologram.</p>
<p>“What’s up?”</p>
<p>[How’s the construction going? Is everything fine?]</p>
<p>“Yup. I think it’ll be finished in a month.”</p>
<p>The underground city was huge, but Genkelope's crew worked unbelievably fast. Thanks to the [Regeneration Orb] the workers could work continuously without resting.</p>
<p>[Mm. You said you were using the technology of the Genkelope’s Vessel, right?]</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded and asked cautiously.</p>
<p>[Then could you help me?]</p>
<p>“…Help you?”</p>
<p>[‘Essential Dynamics’ is working to build underground cities in Seoul, Busan, and Ulsan as well as in the U.S. and Japan.]</p>
<p>“Ah, really? That sounds like a good plan. I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was as meticulous as always.</p>
<p>[Thank you. I’ll send my people to you later. I have to go now-]</p>
<p>“Ah, give me a moment.”</p>
<p>Suddenly I remembered something. I turned my head to the side and saw Boss, who was glaring at me with a sullen look.</p>
<p>I muted Yoo Yeonha and said, “Boss, the Mountain Sage members are still locked up, right?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“It’s time to use them.”</p>
<p>With a smirk, I unmuted the smartwatch.</p>
<p>“We’ve been keeping tabs on some wonderful informants.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s hologram tilted her head.</p>
<p>[…Informants?]</p>
<p>“Yeah, they’re called the Mountain Sage.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was an expert at persuading people. Despite being locked up for six months, the Mountain Sage had yet to reveal who ordered my assassination. Perhaps Yoo Yeonha could persuade them to speak.</p>
<p>[Mountain Sage? <em>The</em> Mountain Sage?!]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s calm voice became unusually high-pitched.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure we’re talking about the same people. They’re incredible.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s cheeks were flushed. She would always get extremely excited whenever she discovered talent.</p>
<p>I said with a smile, “You can have them. That is, if you can persuade them.”</p>
<p>[What do you mean by that?]</p>
<p>“I’ll text you the details later.”</p>
<p>Sadly, our call would have to end here. I had no choice. Boss had been staring at me way too intensely for some time.</p>
<p>[Ah, okay. I’ll be waiting for your text.]</p>
<p>“Yeah. Bye.”</p>
<p>[Bye!]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clenched her fists and hung up. I turned my gaze to Boss. She was pouting.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been on the phone too long. And, I don’t want to hand them over. They tried to kill you.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Her voice was soaked in anger.</p>
<p>With a soft smile, I put my hand on Boss’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m handing them over. To find out who was trying to kill me.”</p>
<p>The Mountain Sage members were all immune to mental interventions, and neither torture nor hypnosis worked on them.</p>
<p>But I knew Yoo Yeonha could find a way to break them.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Boss said nothing, but her silence always meant consent. So I slowly reached for her hand.</p>
<p>“Now, should we get something to eat?”</p>
<p>Boss’s gaze traveled down. Looking at our clasped hands, Boss slowly nodded.</p>
<p>“Let’s go~”</p>
<p>I pulled her hand towards the restaurant with her favorite dish— ‘dumplings’.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[The last round of the Gate of Glory Qualification Tournament will be held at the Temple of Justice.]</p>
<p>[It has been a long journey. Now, the remaining 1000 Heroes are heading for the Temple.]</p>
<p>[This will be the last hurdle for the countless Heroes gathered.]</p>
<p>The moment the theme of the 4th round of the Qualification Tournament was announced, the Internet began to overflow with news articles. Everyone on various social media sites was talking about the Tournament, and gambling sites began hosting real-time bets on who would be included in the final 200.</p>
<p>“…These three are the judges?”</p>
<p>And here at the Temple of Justice which was now the center of global attention, Aileen was looking around the waiting room of the judges.</p>
<p>“It’s four in total, including you, Chairman Aileen,” answered her secretary. But Aileen seemed rather dissatisfied with the lineup.</p>
<p>“Good to see you, little one.”</p>
<p>The one who just called Aileen ‘little one’ was ‘Heynckes’ of the Nine Stars. Aileen sat down on a chair, sighing disapprovingly.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, little one?”</p>
<p>“…Dammit. Stop calling me little one,” snapped Aileen.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t dissatisfied with Heynckes. She considered him well qualified to be the judge of the Tournament. No one would be more suited than an active member of the Nine Stars.</p>
<p>The person she had a problem with was the woman sitting next to Heynckes.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>As the Chief Officer of Essence of the Strait, she was known for many things, but as a Hero she was merely a high-intermediate-rank grade-1 at best. Aileen still couldn’t understand why a weakling like Yoo Yeonha was called the ‘Queen of Seoul’ by so many people.</p>
<p>“…Hello.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha lowered her head with a small smile. Aileen snorted and turned her gaze to the man sitting on the other side of Heynckes.</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk, the master of Baekdu Mountain.</p>
<p>He was busy reading a book, not even sparing Aileen a glance. It had been a while since they last saw each other, but he was still as snobby as ever.</p>
<p>“Ah, right. Lord Heynckes.”</p>
<p>At that moment, she heard Yoo Yeonha’s voice. Aileen again shifted her gaze to Yoo Yeonha, who was handing what seemed to be a pill to Heynckes.</p>
<p>“…What’s this?” asked Heynckes. Aileen also stared at the pill with sparkly eyes.</p>
<p>‘Is it vitamins?’ she wondered, when Yoo Yeonha courteously responded, “It’s the cure for your side effect that we talked about before.”</p>
<p>“The cure?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin had passed on the pills he had made to Yoo Yeonha and asked her to distribute them to the Nine Stars who were suffering from serious side effects. Yoo Yeonha gladly accepted.</p>
<p>“…Is this what you tried to give me last time?”</p>
<p>“They’re similar.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Heynckes stared at the pill for a while before grabbing it and putting it inside his pocket. He then said bashfully, “I do need to stay alive until at least the Demon Realm Gate opens.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for accepting it.”</p>
<p>“…I should be the one thanking you. I really don’t think my heart has a lot of time left, and I’ve been regretting declining your offer last time.”</p>
<p>Aileen turned away from them and began organizing the papers for the meeting. “I like gifts. And pills, too.” She muttered to herself.</p>
<p>…As she neared her 40s, she had recently grown more interested in health.</p>
<p>“Oh, I have a gift for you as well, Chairman Aileen.”</p>
<p>Of course, Yoo Yeonha was not the type to miss such an opportunity.</p>
<p>The gift she prepared for Aileen was a box of top-class medicinal pills. Each pill contained a small amount of [Dimensional Entropy] and was worth at least 100 million won. There were 60 of these pills in the box.</p>
<p>“…H-Hmm. Yeah? I guess I’ll take it, if you so insist.”</p>
<p>Aileen hugged the gift box tightly.</p>
<p>“Well then, should we get on with the meeting? To discuss how we’re gonna judge?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha bit her lips, trying hard not to laugh out loud at Aileen who was beaming in satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Look, we have to pick 200 out of 1000 people. But do we have enough time to meet all the candidates? Of course we don’t. So we should first pick out the most qualified candidates, and-”</p>
<p>“Ah, about that,” Yoo Yeonha intervened.</p>
<p>Because of the gift she had just received, Aileen felt more forgiving than usual. So she casually asked, “What is it?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Without a word, Yoo Yeonha put forth an envelope.</p>
<p>A black and a golden lotus symbol was embossed on it.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin wrote this letter and left it to Yoo Yeonha, hoping to earn himself a spot in the final 200.</p>
<p>“This is….”</p>
<p>Aileen looked at the envelope—the symbol on the envelope, to be precise—and frowned.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a letter from Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Heynckes and Yoo Sihyuk, who had been quite all along, opened their eyes wide.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha glanced at them and continued cautiously, “Black Lotus sent this letter to my guild. It appears that he also wants to enter the Gate…. What do you think? I’d like to hear your opinions.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea — Demon Realm Gate]</p>
<p>Cold wind swept across the land under the gray sky. It was unusual weather for a day in April.</p>
<p>The last round of the Qualification Tournament was over and the entire selection process had ended. Black Lotus was secretly selected as one of the participants.</p>
<p>I came to the site of the Demon Realm Gate when I realized that the deadline of 30 days as denoted by the Gate would be over soon.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>Because the area around the Gate had been sealed off to the public, it was very quiet here.</p>
<p>I hid myself in a nearby mountain and looked around. There were many Heroes and Djinns down below. Heroes sought to enter the Gate, and the Djinns wanted to take their place.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly the wind blew. And with that wind— a certain existence appeared next to me.</p>
<p>“…You’re here,” I muttered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I am,” Jin Sahyuk said with a nod. On her back, [Alexander III’s Cape] was fluttering boastingly in the wind.</p>
<p>I looked at the people below.</p>
<p>On the Heroes’ side I saw Chae Nayun, Kim Suho, Shin Jonghak, Jin Seyeon, Aileen, Yoon Seung-Ah, Rachel, Yoo Jinwoong, Kim Junwoo, Vast Expense, and even Bell… in terms of strength, all of them were qualified to represent humanity.</p>
<p>“I see Bell over there.”</p>
<p>“It’s not only Bell,” Jin Sahyuk remarked in all seriousness, “There are also a lot of Djinns. Inside that gate is where the greatest devil of all time will be born.”</p>
<p>“The greatest devil… are you talking about Bell?”</p>
<p>I took out my bow and arrows. It was just as Jin Sahyuk said. There were too many Djinns here in the mountain range in Hamgyeong-do.</p>
<p>Below the ground, above the ground, even in the sky. They were waiting for their chance to enter the Gate of the Demon Realm.</p>
<p>“Yes. Inside the Gate is where Bell will die and Baal will be born.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I notched five [Dark Ore Arrows] against the bowstring and shot them.</p>
<p><em>Chweeek—</em></p>
<p>The arrows flew like a hawk towards the Djinns. <em>Keuk— Keuk—</em> I heard ear-splitting shrieks.</p>
<p>“…Then.”</p>
<p>I retrieved the arrows and notched them again. Then I asked Jin Sahyuk, “Does that mean we’re 100% sure that Baal is going to descend?”</p>
<p>“…‘Kill me inside the Gate of the Demon Realm and eliminate Baal.’”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk mimicked Bell’s voice. It was quite similar, and a laugh escaped my lips.</p>
<p>“That’s what Bell said.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I agree. If Baal does descend, we can’t bring him to Earth. We’ll have to end him in there.”</p>
<p>Baal in my setting was close to God. He would probably be more powerful than Orden and would try to transform the Earth immediately.</p>
<p>That’s why we would have to end everything inside. Once Baal escapes, the Earth would be destroyed for good.</p>
<p>“What are you gonna do, Jin Sahyuk?”</p>
<p>But there was one more thing I needed to ask Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>She would need to rely on Baal’s powers if she wanted to connect Akatrina and the Earth. Therefore, if Jin Sahyuk did not give up on her initial goal—to return to her homeland—she would have no choice but to cooperate with Baal.</p>
<p>“Bell and I will take care of that.”</p>
<p>“How-”</p>
<p>“I’ll make sure it doesn’t cause you a problem, so stay out of it.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was adamant.</p>
<p>I nodded reluctantly and shot the arrows again. [Dark Ore Arrows] danced in the air as they flew towards the Djinns. They disposed of a dozen Djinns and returned to me.</p>
<p>—Fuck! Someone’s shooting arrows!</p>
<p>—It’s dark arrows! Dark arrows!</p>
<p>—Dark arrows… that means Black Lotus.</p>
<p>—Damn it, that son of a bitch…!</p>
<p>The Djinns, cornered by my surprise attack, initiated Devil Transformation. But that was a bad decision.</p>
<p>Heroes immediately detected the change in their demonic energy. Aileen was the first to jump up in the air and track down the demonic energy. Destroying her enemies with her Spirit Speech, she was as merciless as the Grim Reaper.</p>
<p>—What do you think you’re doing here! Vermins, you’ll be crushed!</p>
<p>And her Spirit Speech crushed the Djinns quite literally. Yoo Sihyuk’s white wolves jumped in, followed by Yoo Jinwoong’s electric strikes and Shin Jonghak’s dark flames.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Watching the scene unfold, I called Jin Sahyuk’s name. She looked at me.</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I hesitated, unable to look her in the eye. I opened my mouth then closed it again. It took me a while, but I finally managed to get it out.</p>
<p>I wanted Jin Sahyuk to hear this.</p>
<p>“Can’t you just stay here?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said nothing.</p>
<p>I waited for her to answer.</p>
<p>But she kept her silence… and suddenly.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo—</em></p>
<p>The Demon Realm Gate began releasing magic power. The giant magic power shook the earth and spread in all directions. The fight between the Djinns and the Heroes stopped, and runic symbols rose above the slowly opening gate.</p>
<p>I translated it with my Gift.</p>
<p>[The Demon Realm Gate shall determine who among the humans gathered here qualifies to enter it.]</p>
<p>That was all there was.</p>
<p>The moment I finished reading it, however, branch-shaped magic power flowed out from the half-open Gate.</p>
<p>—Kieeeek</p>
<p>Two of the many branches stretching out in all directions came this way and wrapped around Jin Sahyuk and me.</p>
<p>“What the…!”</p>
<p>“Dammit.”</p>
<p>We didn’t even have time to react.</p>
<p><em>Whish—!</em></p>
<p>The branch of magic power bound our bodies tightly and dragged us into the Demon Realm Gate without a moment’s delay.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 317. Demon Realm Gate (3)</p>
<p>“Hello, we are at the opening of the Gate of Glory.”</p>
<p>Reporters from all over the world gathered in Hamgyeong Province. Although they were prohibited from going near the gate, they could film and report from afar.</p>
<p>“On estime que la porte….”</p>
<p>“Zarban and Leonardo have been selected for the final 200…..”</p>
<p>“ここにはまた、世界の有名人が集めています….”</p>
<p>Various languages could be heard in the North Hamgyeong Province Plaza. Noticing the countless cameras, Yoo Yeonha busily went around meeting celebrities that were present.</p>
<p>“You’re here too, Soohyuk-ssi?”</p>
<p>After meeting several corporate leaders, Yoo Yeonha found Park Soohyuk, the CEO of SH Agency, now renowned as the world’s greatest.</p>
<p>“Haha, yes, I was lucky enough to receive an invitation.”</p>
<p>“It might get dangerous when the gate opens.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’ll be fine, especially with Essence of the Strait’s guild members protecting us.”</p>
<p>Hearing Park Soohyuk’s subtle praise, Yoo Yeonha smiled. As he said, many Essence of the Strait guild members, including Kim Youngjin, Yi Jin-Ah, Leonel, Yohei, Shen Yuan, Ah Hae-In, and even Heynckes, none of whom were even among the 200 chosen to enter the gate, were present at the scene.</p>
<p>“Still, stay alert. At least make sure you’re wearing protective gear.”</p>
<p>“Oh, protective gear?”</p>
<p>Park Soohyuk smiled in response and tapped on his smartwatch. Immediately, reinforced magic power rose up from the watch and shrouded him.</p>
<p>“Hm~”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha watched the scene and nodded her head in satisfaction. Park Soohyuk’s smartwatch had a detailed magic enchantment courtesy of [Dimensional Entropy]. Developed by Essential Dynamics, it was the commercial version of Protect Watch.</p>
<p>Reinforced magic power produced by the Protect Watch rivaled that of an intermediate-rank grade-1 Hero. It was no different than a portable suit of armor. Unsurprisingly, its cost of production and lack of material made it worth well over 100 million won.</p>
<p>“It’s scary how far Essence of the Strait’s technology has gone. I can’t begin to see the end of it.”</p>
<p>Park Soohyuk shook his head in raw amazement.</p>
<p>“Huhu, the new technological revolution is only just beginning.”</p>
<p>Dimensional Entropy, a resource containing infinite potential. Just thinking about it put a smile on Yoo Yeonha’s face.</p>
<p><em>Wooong—!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a huge surge of magic power erupted, and the area turned boisterous.</p>
<p>“I-It looks like the gate is opening!”</p>
<p>“What a brilliant flash of mana!”</p>
<p>The earth shook, and the screams of reporters and spectators intertwined. Yoo Yeonha and Park Soohyuk quickly clad themselves in reinforced magic power, while Jin Sechan, Kim Youngjin, and other core members of Essence of the Strait ran to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Chief Officer!”</p>
<p>They came to lead Yoo Yeonha to a safer place.</p>
<p>But, at that moment…</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>Several streams of magic power shot up through the ground. Like tentacles, the streams of magic power coiled around Yoo Yeonha’s body and dragged her underneath before the Heroes could do anything.</p>
<p>“S-Shoot!”</p>
<p>Kim Youngjin and Jin Sechan immediately threw themselves into the crack in the ground.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>… My head hurt, and my body felt feeble. It felt like my body was floating on water, exhausted and lacking in energy. I couldn’t see anything nor feel the flow of time.</p>
<p>Strangely, my consciousness slowly turned clearer. Who I am, why I’m here, what I needed to do from here…. My understanding of the situation was returning.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>At that moment, the sound of someone’s breath flowed into my ears. I couldn’t tell whether it was mine or someone else’s. I simply focused on the sound and tried to regain my dulled senses.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>I heard another breath. It was easy from then. I could tell now that the breath was indeed mine. I repeatedly took long breaths and moved parts of my body. Soon, my eyes opened.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>My vision returned, and the first thing I saw was an old drawer. It was worn-down and moldy, with bugs crawling over it.</p>
<p>I frowned and twisted my body towards the ceiling.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>The bed I was lying on made a creaking noise. The ceiling was even moldier than the drawer.</p>
<p>“…Am I in a prison cell?”</p>
<p>With a bewildered murmur, I got up. Immediately, a huge wave of dizziness swept through me, and my body fell back on the bed.</p>
<p><em>Crack—</em></p>
<p>The shabby bed broke down.</p>
<p>“Argh….”</p>
<p>It seemed I had no choice but to rest a bit more. I pressed my temple for the next five minutes and then got up once more.</p>
<p>“Auu.”</p>
<p>I was still dizzy, but I could move properly. First, I checked the interior of the room. A bed, a drawer, and a closet with two uniforms. Other than those, a mish-mash of items on the drawer were the only noteworthy objects.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>I examined the writing utensils on the drawer. A notepad, a pen, a bag, a half-eaten bento box, and an identification card.</p>
<p>The identification card was obviously the most eye-catching item.</p>
<p>[Lorenzio Secret Service, F-rank Sharpshooter – Kim Hajin]</p>
<p>[ID Number – 02937102]</p>
<p>“F-rank Sharpshooter… Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>I frowned. I knew nothing about how the Demon Realm Gate worked. Naturally, I had no clue what situation I was in.</p>
<p>I examined the identification card more closely, but there wasn’t anything else of note. Next, I opened the drawer. A crossbow and an arrow were stored inside it.</p>
<p>“Sharpshooter, huh.”</p>
<p>‘I guess I am one.’ I laughed inwardly and opened the second layer. It only had casual clothes and nothing else. It was the same for the third layer.</p>
<p>“…What situation am I in?”</p>
<p>‘There isn’t even a hint?’ Just as I was thinking that, a series of messages popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>[This is the world where Baal was first born.]</p>
<p>[You are participating as a supporter of this world, and your goal is the annihilation of Baal.]</p>
<p>[Your variable stats have been suppressed from the effects of dimensional travel, but do not worry. It will be fixed over time, or you can hasten it through training.]</p>
<p>[A total of 200 people from Earth have entered the Demon Realm Gate.]</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I studied the messages then checked my stats.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Strength 4 (+1)]</p>
<p>[Stamina 4 (+1)]</p>
<p>[Speed 4 (+1)]</p>
<p>[Perception 4 (+1)]</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what rejective force was exactly, but I checked Stigma’s magic power first.</p>
<p><em>Guoo….</em> Thankfully, I still had all five streaks of Stigma. However, the weapons I stored inside the Stigma were gone. Both the Desert Eagle and Aether.</p>
<p>“Wait, hey, where are my weapons?”</p>
<p>I asked, but no reply returned. I became worried. I couldn’t do anything without my gear.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>—It’s time for food~! Come out, everyone~!</p>
<p>Someone’s shouting voice rang out from outside the door. It was so loud that even the room was shaking.</p>
<p>I flinched, then looked out the window. The navy sky clearly indicated it was twilight. They’re eating at this time of the day?</p>
<p>—Food~!</p>
<p>Other voices rang out. I opened the door to check what was going on. A hallway stretched out beyond the door, and I could see other people busily running towards one direction. I seemed to be in a dorm of some sort.</p>
<p>“I’m coming~”</p>
<p>I changed into the uniform hanging in the worn-down closet and chased after them. Five minutes later, we arrived at a cafeteria, similar to the one I saw when I was in the Korean army in the original world.</p>
<p>I followed what the others were doing. After receiving my portion of food, I sat down at a random table.</p>
<p>“…Ah, you idiot, no, you retard!”</p>
<p>But at that moment, a man who seemed to be a leader or instructor of some sort pointed at me and shouted. Everyone in the cafeteria turned to me, and I stood up straight in a fluster. I was reacting the same way I did when I messed up in the army.</p>
<p>“Are you a D-rank?! Why are you sitting at the D-rank table?!”</p>
<p>“…Sorry!”</p>
<p>I could guess what I did wrong. I was F-rank according to my identification card.</p>
<p>I shot up with an apology.</p>
<p>“Sit down at the correct place next time, you brainless fool!”</p>
<p>“Yes! My apologies!”</p>
<p>“Screw off now.”</p>
<p>I glanced at the instructor before looking at the table I was just at. Indeed, the letter ‘D’ was clearly inscribed on it.</p>
<p>Distancing myself from the table, I began to look for the table with the F-label.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>In the corner of the cafeteria, I found a table that was on the brink of collapsing.</p>
<p>I scurried towards it and sat down next to someone I didn’t know. Soon afterward, a man with disheveled hair came and sat down as well.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I looked at the man sitting in front of me. More precisely, I looked at the uniform he was wearing. On his chest was a sword-shaped nameplate, and his uniform was light-green colored just like the one I had.</p>
<p>Next, I turned to the D-rank table I was just at. The people sitting there had uniforms that were slightly greener.</p>
<p>“Mm~”</p>
<p>It seemed the color of the uniform was a good indicator of one’s rank. I nodded my head and talked to the guy sitting next to me.</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>The man looked at me curiously. I thought about what to ask before giving up. It didn’t seem like such a good idea to ask where we were or what we were doing here.</p>
<p>“…No, nothing. Do you want to eat my share as well?”</p>
<p>“Huh…? Uh, sure.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>—One, two! One, two! One, two!</p>
<p>After the early breakfast came a morning training session. I used Stigma’s magic power to make it seem like my right arm was rotting so I could skip it and go collect information about this world.</p>
<p>“…An army.”</p>
<p>To the right of the military training ground was a large castle. According to 「Observation and Reading」, it was [Duke Lorenzio’s Castle]. It was likely the military command of this place.</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to the left of the military training ground, where the dorm I woke up in was located. Several college building-like structures were standing there. The entire place seemed to be called [Lorenzio Knight Training Institution].</p>
<p>Compared to it, the military training ground and the dorm were places where trash was stored.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>I slowly walked towards the left. After about 500 steps from the training ground, I arrived at a large building. The word ‘library’ was written across it. Luckily, I arrived at the perfect place to help me learn about this world.</p>
<p>I walked in without hesitation. Perhaps because of the morning training, no one was inside.</p>
<p>“Let’s see. History, history, history….”</p>
<p>I went to the history section of the library and picked out several books to read. The information I obtained from 30 minutes of reading was the following:</p><ol><li>I was in a dukedom ruled by the Lorenzio clan, and the dukedom was part of the Arunheim Kingdom.</li><li>Duke Lorenzio was a commander, and the Lorenzio Knight Training Institution trained not only knights but also foot soldiers.</li><li>I was unsurprisingly a common soldier. Even among them, I was at the lowest F-rank, being nothing more than a meat shield.</li></ol><p>“…Did I possess this guy’s body?”</p>
<p>I frowned and complained inwardly about being a common soldier. Still, I was happy I got to learn a little more about the world behind the Demon Realm Gate.</p>
<p>I got up from the seat and stood in front of a library mirror. I still looked like myself – Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“Hm… Ah.”</p>
<p>Then, I suddenly remembered something and nodded my head.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that I took over someone’s body. In novel terminology, I had transmigrated, meaning that I was inserted into this world.</p>
<p>I took out the notepad I brought from my room and jotted down my current goals.</p><ol><li>Recover my strength and find other Heroes from Earth.</li><li>Find Bell. He will be the key to Baal’s descent.</li><li>Find my weapon. In addition to the Desert Eagle and Aether, Misteltein Bullet was critical for annihilating Baal.</li><li>Annihilation of Baal.</li></ol><p>Just as I finished writing my goals…</p>
<p>“Oi!”</p>
<p>Someone shouted and grabbed me by the neck.</p>
<p>“Ak!”</p>
<p>“You retard, who do you think you are? This isn’t a place you can enter!”</p>
<p>Startled, I turned around. A red-haired knight was glaring at me, with his hand still on my neck.</p>
<p>“Huh? Sorry, I, aaak—!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t resist at all. The difference in our strength was too big, and the knight simply dragged me away.</p>
<p>“H-Hold on a minute!”</p>
<p>“This is the first time I’ve seen a soldier sneak into the library.”</p>
<p>“W-Wait, I didn’t sneak in, I just wanted to read some books…”</p>
<p>“That’s what sneaking in is.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Shut it.”</p>
<p>With those two words, my breath stopped. His grip around my neck became stronger, and I couldn’t eke out another word.</p>
<p>“Kak….”</p>
<p>Just like that, I blacked out.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>“…An F-rank soldier sneaked into the library?”</p>
<p>Knight Commander Airun furrowed her brows at the unexpected report. She had the highest position in the Lorenzio Knight Training Institution and was a sworn sister of Duke Lorenzio’s daughter.</p>
<p>“Yes, we threw him into a cell for now.”</p>
<p>“…What would a foot soldier even read there? I’m sure he just got lost.”</p>
<p>The male knight shook his head at Airun’s question.</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought when I first received the report, but we found a stack of books he was reading.”</p>
<p>“…Interesting.”</p>
<p>A foot soldier reading books in a library. Airun nodded her head, though she snickered at the strange idea.</p>
<p>“If he was only reading, it isn’t too big of a crime.”</p>
<p>“But he is an F-rank soldier from a commoner background. He isn’t even allowed to walk up the stairs to the West Wing….”</p>
<p>“Draven?”</p>
<p>Airun interrupted the knight and stared at him with her clear, ocean-like eyes. Draven closed his mouth and dropped his head.</p>
<p>“…Don’t be so tough. If a soldier acts out of line, you should first figure out what motivated him to act in such a way. The punishment comes afterward.”</p>
<p>Draven didn’t respond. Seeing Draven so obedient, Airun smiled. Although Draven had a good character and was a skilled knight, he was too concerned with social hierarchy. Airun saw this as a shame since she believed it was the only flaw preventing him from being a good leader.</p>
<p>“Alright, keep him imprisoned for a week. I won’t allow any more than that.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 318. A New Path (1)</p>
<p>I was currently in a guardhouse. Well, perhaps it was a prison cell. Whatever the case, the point was that I was locked up. Locked up and working out. Push ups, plank, pull ups, etc.</p>
<p>[Your strength increases by 0.1]</p>
<p>[Your vitality increases by 0.1]</p>
<p>[Your stamina increases by 0.1]</p>
<p>As the above alerts showed, the exercise was going pretty well. I experienced an increase of 0.6 points in just 36 hours. I couldn’t have experienced such a rapid increase on Earth.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I looked at the veins protruding out of my forearm. At this rate, I believed I would be able to regain my original abilities in a couple of months.</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly the door burst open.</p>
<p>I lifted my head and looked at the door.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap.</em> I heard heavy footsteps approaching. <em>Clang.</em> I heard the sound of metal clanging against metal.</p>
<p>A person in a robe stood in front of my cell.</p>
<p>“Are you the F-rank sharpshooter Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>A clear voice flowed into my ears. It was a beautiful voice, one that no one would ever forget once they heard it.</p>
<p>“I am,” I answered.</p>
<p>A woman wearing a hooded robe gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“Is it true that you broke into the library to read books?”</p>
<p>The woman looked at me and asked, and only then did I realize her name and her status. Observation and Reading had activated a little late.</p>
<p>[Airun - Knight Commander]</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“So does that mean you can read?”</p>
<p>Was the illiteracy rate in this world high? Airun gave a broad smile when I answered that I could read.</p>
<p>“Great, that’s good to hear.”</p>
<p>She took out a copperplate and a card from inside her robe.</p>
<p>“I understand that only those who are competent can enter the Lorenzio Secret Service. Statistics prove that the soldiers in the Secret Service are usually a rank or two better than soldiers in other squads,” Airun said and threw the copperplate and the card into my cell.</p>
<p>“I heard it’s only been three months since you joined the army.”</p>
<p>I examined the copperplate. Short sentences were written on it.</p>
<p>[1:30 AM, March 8th, a stable near the eastern gate of Lorenzio]</p>
<p>[I need an sharpshooter to guide me through the Rotio Mountains]</p>
<p>[He needs to be able to read this copperplate]</p>
<p>I thought the last sentence was a bit odd but decided to move on to the card for now. The card had the words [Supply Card] written across it in black.</p>
<p>“Can you read that copperplate?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon? Ah, Yes. I can. 1:30 AM, March 8th.”</p>
<p>When I read what was written on the copperplate, Airun smiled and continued.</p>
<p>“Alright. Now, listen up. I’d like to hire you on a secret mission. Surely you’re aware that as an F-rank soldier, your career in the army can end at any moment now that you’re in jail.”</p>
<p>I listened to her carefully since I didn’t know anything about the situation I was currently in.</p>
<p>“However, if you come back alive from this mission, I’ll guarantee you a spot in the army, not just as an ordinary soldier but as a commissioned officer. …Oh, and you’ll be released immediately if you accept my offer.”</p>
<p>It turns out she was asking for my help.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>I was wondering whether I should accept her offer or not, when all of a sudden several sentences popped up before my eyes.</p>
<p>[New Event]</p>
<p>[Summary - Airun has chosen you as Harin’s bodyguard.]</p>
<p>[Difficulty - High]</p>
<p>[Goal - Escort ‘Harin’ safely to the ‘Republic of Leores’ in the south.]</p>
<p>[Reward - A piece of equipment that you lost.]</p>
<p>“I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>I immediately nodded my head.</p>
<p>“Good. You’ll change into regular clothes and depart tomorrow. You’ll be able to get all the equipment you need from the armory with that card.”</p>
<p>Airun smiled and turned around. Her movements were very graceful.</p>
<p>As she walked down the hallway towards the exit, the guard approached me and opened the cell door.</p>
<p>“You’re being released, F-rank Sharpshooter Kim Hajin. You’ll have to fill out a short form before leaving.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>KOOOONG—!</em></p>
<p>The guardhouse door closed shut. Airun let out a sigh as she watched the iron door close. As always, it was too heavy and bulky for her taste. A simple magic processing would’ve been enough to solve the issue, but whoever constructed it had not bothered in the slightest.</p>
<p>“…So this is where you are.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, an annoyed voice caught Airun’s attention. Startled, Airun turned her gaze to where the voice had come from.</p>
<p>There, her subordinate ‘Draven’ was waiting for her.</p>
<p>“Draven.”</p>
<p>“Commander, are you up to something again?”</p>
<p>“…That’s no way to speak to your superior.”</p>
<p>Airun put on a solemn expression, but Draven was persistent. Now even more serious than before, he blocked Airun’s way.</p>
<p>Left with no other option, Airun spoke with a sigh, “An old frenemy of mine has asked me to lend her a sharpshooter”</p>
<p>“An old frenemy…?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Airun smiled bitterly and continued, “I’m sure you know her as well.”</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Draven widened his eyes. There was only one person he could think of, the sister of the man who had been executed for spreading false rumors about the prince.</p>
<p>Draven exclaimed in aghast, “Commander!”</p>
<p>“…Shh.”</p>
<p>“They might think we’re working with the traitors. They-”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. That’s why I came here specifically.”</p>
<p>Harin, the eldest daughter of the Leon Clan.</p>
<p>Because of her brother’s treacherous prophecy—‘Someday the prince will become the devil and destroy the world.’—her entire family had been killed off, and she was the sole survivor.</p>
<p>“She’s in need of a sharpshooter to help her escape. He’s not even D-rank. I can spare her an F-rank soldier. No one would notice that he’s gone anyway.”</p>
<p>Airun had already tested the F-rank sharpshooter named Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>The copperplate that Airun showed to Kim Hajin, only those with good eyesight could read the letters engraved on it. It was a magic item designed specifically for that purpose.</p>
<p>“Lending her a soldier won’t change her situation, but it could change ours-”</p>
<p>“Draven.”</p>
<p>Airun interrupted Draven adamantly.</p>
<p>“It’s something I decided, and you have no right to stop me. And, I know for sure that you’re also indebted to Leon.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Drevon fell silent. It was just as the Commander said— The Duke of Leon was an ardent supporter of Arunheim’s knights. He lent support to those with talent regardless of his or her status and offered financial support so that the beneficiaries could focus on honing their sword skills.</p>
<p>Airun was one of Leon’s beneficiaries. Though she and Harin drifted apart because of something that happened in the past, she had yet to forget all the support she’d received from her family.</p>
<p>“…Fine.”</p>
<p>Draven, a local aristocrat and another beneficiary of Leon, finally gave in.</p>
<p>“But, Commander, it’ll be fine if that soldier dies during the mission, but if by any chance he comes back alive, I’ll kill him myself. We need to keep this to ourselves.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Airun said nothing. She passed her subordinate quietly and Draven followed her in slow steps.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[New Event]</p>
<p>[Summary - Airun has chosen you as Harin’s bodyguard.]</p>
<p>[Difficulty - High]</p>
<p>[Goal - Escort ‘Harin’ safely to the ‘Republic of Leores’ in the south.]</p>
<p>[Reward - A piece of equipment that you lost.]</p>
<p>I scrutinized the details of this important mission and changed into new clothes as soon as I got out of the guardhouse. I started feeling itchy again the moment I put them on.</p>
<p>My next destination was the armory. The guards at the armory tried to stop me at first, but stepped down when I showed them the card; as Airun had told me to do. They then gave me the necessary weapons.</p>
<p>“Chainmail, hunting backpack, crampons, iron crossbow, 40 bronze magic bolts. Are you all set?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>I picked out the best equipment from the armory. Of course, all of them were mundane at best, but I could probably make them more useful through [Random Consolidation System].</p>
<p>“Good luck.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>I exchanged greetings with the guards and left the armory.</p>
<p>I then headed to the shooting range. My mission was to begin tomorrow and I felt the need to sharpen my skills.</p>
<p>“It’s big.”</p>
<p>The shooting range was 15 meters wide and 500 meters long. It seemed pretty well taken care of.</p>
<p>I stood in a lane and took out the crossbow.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>I cocked and loaded the bolt against the bowstring and aimed at the target.</p>
<p>Then I fired.</p>
<p><em>Tang—!</em></p>
<p>Immediately after I shot my first bolt, I shot the second.</p>
<p><em>Tang—!</em></p>
<p>My second bolt fiercely chased after the first.</p>
<p>It was as if I shot them both at the same time. This ‘rapid fire’ technique was made possible by my Gift.</p>
<p><em>Koong—! Koong—!</em></p>
<p>A heavy sound rang out. The first bolt landed in the center area and the second bolt split the first bolt in half and penetrated the target.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I nodded in satisfaction. Despite the fact that my stats had decreased, the result was great. With the combination of my accuracy and Stigma, I was confident that I could dominate almost all enemies with a single shot.</p>
<p>“…I wonder what everyone is doing.”</p>
<p>A sudden curiosity captured my attention.</p>
<p>There were a total of 200 Earthlings in this world.</p>
<p>Did they all start at the very bottom like me? Or did they start higher, more towards the middle? Or maybe some of them became aristocrats and were in a better position to see how the wind was blowing.</p>
<p>I took out the Book of Truth to find out the answer.</p>
<p>“Where is Kim Suho in this world?”</p>
<p>I assumed this question would take up 2 streaks, which was risky now that my physical abilities were limited. But I wanted to know where Kim Suho was no matter what.</p>
<p>[…Kim Suho is in the Republic of Leores to the south.]</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>My eyes widened.</p>
<p>“That’s where I’m going.”</p>
<p>A small laugh escaped my lips as I thanked my luck.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Arunheim, March 8th of Kairos calendar, one late night at the duchy of Lorenzio.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>Short blue hair and sharp facial features. Not even dirt and bulky armor could hide the beauty that once charmed the entire kingdom.</p>
<p>Anyone would notice this mysterious yet filthy woman. This fact made ‘Harin’, the last survivor of Leon, tremble in fear even more.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>In a stable near the castle wall, she was wandering alone in fear. She managed to arrive at the duchy of Lorenzio thanks to the help of the knights. Currently, she was alone. Her only companion had left her to divert the attention of the enemy.</p>
<p>—Wait!</p>
<p>It was then she heard a man shouting.</p>
<p>“Hup!”</p>
<p>Harin hid behind a wall and covered her mouth.</p>
<p>—Let’s hit up another place! The night is still young.</p>
<p>—Great idea! Let’s go!</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>She waited in the dark for Airun’s help to arrive, whilst continually being startled by the footsteps of the passersby and wild animals.</p>
<p>“How much longer do I have to wait…?”</p>
<p>Harin felt humiliated that she had to ask Airun for help, but she had no other choice. She decided that staying alive was more important than her dignity.</p>
<p>She had asked for a sharpshooter. To escape from Arunheim, she had to cross a rugged mountain range.</p>
<p>“Wait, did she…?”</p>
<p>But she couldn’t rule out the possibility that Airun betrayed her. She knew Airun wasn’t the type to go back on her word, but…. Harin put her hands together and prayed for Airun to remember all the good things that the Leon Clan had done for her.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Is that you?”</p>
<p>A voice captured Harin’s attention.</p>
<p>Startled, Harin took a step back and raised her head. She saw in the shadow of the castle wall a man hidden under his robe.</p>
<p>Harin gulped and looked at the man.</p>
<p>“…You are?”</p>
<p>She felt relieved, but only for a moment. The tension in the atmosphere heightened as she began to suspect the man as an assassin sent by the royal family to kill her.</p>
<p>“I’m the receiver of this copperplate.”</p>
<p>The man showed Harin the copperplate she had given to Airun. This was the proof that the mysterious man was on her side.</p>
<p>But Harin still felt doubtful, for she couldn’t deny the possibility that Airun had betrayed her.</p>
<p>“Did Airun send you?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, I’m the pawn.”</p>
<p>“…Pawn?”</p>
<p>Harin felt confused by his word choice, but nevertheless chose to believe him. This was because she knew that if Airun did actually betray her, then she wouldn’t be able to make it to Leores alive no matter what.</p>
<p>“…Nice to meet you. I’m Renha.”</p>
<p>Harin presented an alias and reached out her hand.</p>
<p>“I’m Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>The man also introduced himself and took her hand.</p>
<p>Just like that, she shook hands with the man who would become her bodyguard.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin….”</p>
<p>It was a rather strange name, which made him appear more suspicious.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s me.”</p>
<p>But the man nodded as if he wasn’t suspecting anything, and this made Harin feel a little more comfortable. For an assassin, he did seem too lax, after all.</p>
<p>Harin asked nonchalantly, “I have one horse. Do you know how to ride horses?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Ah, yes, yes, I can.”</p>
<p>“Well then.”</p>
<p>Harin nodded and pulled the horse out of the stable. She was big enough for two people.</p>
<p>“Let’s ride her together. …Ah, but before that,”</p>
<p>Harin suddenly realized that she didn’t know her bodyguard’s rank.</p>
<p>“Are you….”</p>
<p>But she stopped midway through her question.</p>
<p>If this man was a knight, it would be rude for her to ask him about his rank. And if she could actually make it out of Arunheim alive, it was better that they knew nothing about each other.</p>
<p>“…a sharpshooter?”</p>
<p>So she decided to change her question. She wanted to confirm that Airun sent her a sharpshooter.</p>
<p>The man nodded with a smile. “Yes, I’m a sharpshooter.”</p>
<p>That was enough for Harin.</p>
<p>But apparently, not for her bodyguard.</p>
<p>He added another sentence that she would've been perfectly happy without.</p>
<p>“I’m Kim Hajin, an F-rank sharpshooter.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Harin’s mind went blank.</p>
<p>F-rank.</p>
<p>Was this man talking about the F-rank that she knew? The F-rank that was synonymous with trash?</p>
<p>Dumbfounded, Harin looked at the man for a while before asking, “Did you say… F-rank?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Only then did Harin finally get a good look at the man. The way he was dressed was nothing like a knight and more like a common soldier.</p>
<p>Coincidentally— the man even showed her his ID card.</p>
<p>“You can trust me. This is my identification card with my name and my rank.”</p>
<p>[Secret Service Soldier, F-rank Sharpshooter Kim Hajin]</p>
<p>“This is just-”</p>
<p>Trust me? How could I trust you?</p>
<p>Harin stumbled in sudden dizziness. It was stress-induced anemia.</p>
<p>“F-rank….”</p>
<p>She grabbed her head in dizziness. Suddenly resentment overtook her.</p>
<p>‘Airun, how could you? I know I was asking a lot but an F-rank is just too much. He won’t even be able to survive in the mountains I have to cross…..’</p>
<p>“Why….”</p>
<p>Troubled, Harin sank to the floor of the stable.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 319. A New Path (2)</p>
<p>[Lotio Mountain Range, ranging 1400km in length and 240km in width, is a gigantic mountain range located between the Republic of Leores and the Arunheim Kingdom. Each mountain peak has a unique environmental condition and is filled with powerful monsters that prevent human habitation. Keilin Mountain and seven other mountains, which all have a height of over 5000 meters, are all in this mountain range….]</p>
<p>A safe road was constructed from the duchy to the republic, but Harin, the person I had to protect, chose to go over the mountain range. That was enough to tell me what situation she was in.</p>
<p>“…Did you study up?” Harin asked.</p>
<p>I put down the book I was reading and replied with a nod, “Somewhat.”</p>
<p>We were currently in a stable where Harin’s beloved horse was staying. I ran to a bookstore first thing in the morning to pick up a book about Lotio Mountain Range and was now in the middle of reading through it.</p>
<p>“….” Harin gave me an odd look. She was doubting my trustworthiness and most likely lamenting her situation where she had to depend on a mere F-rank soldier.</p>
<p>“…It’s fine if you give up.” After some time, Harin said bitterly. “Lotio Mountain range is infamous. It’s not a place a mere soldier can survive through. I’m confident in my martial prowess with the knight training I received, but I can’t guarantee your safety on such a dangerous trip.”</p>
<p>She spoke honestly. She didn’t blame anyone or complain.</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>I accepted the situation. With my Art, [Parkour], climbing a mountain wasn’t much of a problem. The more obstacles it had, the better my Art would perform. Moreover…</p>
<p>[Harin – Eldest Daughter of Loren Clan, Devil Hunter]</p>
<p>Harin’s status reflected by my gift showed a surprising piece of info – ‘Devil Hunter’. She was clearly someone I should keep an eye on.</p>
<p>“Haa… I wonder where your confidence comes from.” Harin furrowed her brows unhappily before gulping down a bottle of water in one go. “Then let’s make something clear before we set out. If anything happens, I will leave you behind without hesitation.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, I understand.” I nodded my head. “Then shall we go?”</p>
<p>Just as I said that… <em>tzzzt— tzzt—</em> A square box Harin put in the corner of the stable emitted strange noises. The box spat out a piece of paper as though it was a printing machine. Harin snatched up the paper in a smooth motion then began to read it.</p>
<p>“…What’s that?”</p>
<p>Harin responded simply, “I asked my friend to investigate your background.”</p>
<p>“….” Didn’t people usually keep quiet about background investigations? I wasn’t sure whether to call her honest or shameless.</p>
<p>Harin glanced at me and murmured, “Please understand. It’s just to confirm whether your identity is true or not.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, yes.” I was curious what background I had as well, so I just sat still. After a brief moment, Harin’s eyes became a little wider.</p>
<p>“You were an herbalist?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, yeah.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah?” Harin’s eyes turned sharp. I had spoken casually subconsciously.</p>
<p>“Ah, my apologies.”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know when we will say farewell, but please don’t forget about manners.”</p>
<p>Harin gave me a displeased glare before beginning to read the paper again.</p>
<p>“Your family….” But in the next moment, Harin paused. She didn’t finish her sentence. She raised her head slowly, then dropped the paper in a fluster when she met my eyes.</p>
<p>“K-Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Her honest reaction was an obvious giveaway that I didn’t have parents in this world. The co-author sure made that one detail consistent.</p>
<p>“Are you finished?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I want to ask again. Will you really not give up?”</p>
<p>I grinned and nodded my head.</p>
<p>“…Understood. Leines!” Harin let out a light sigh and led her horse, Leines, out of the stable. Meanwhile, I glanced at the paper lying on the floor.</p>
<p>[Lorenzio’s F-rank Knight, Kim Hajin]</p>
<p>[Special Note – Has experience working as an herbalist at the outskirts of the duchy.]</p>
<p>[Training Records – 510 shots, 610 lookouts, 410 close-combat… Has potential to be promoted to B-rank sharpshooter.]</p>
<p>[Family – Orphan. Came to the Lorenzio Temple when he was six and stayed there for ten years before becoming an herbalist.]</p>
<p>At that moment, Harin asked, “Do you really know how to ride a horse? …Ah, I’ll get rid of the report.”</p>
<p>Harin saw that the report was in my hand and burned it using her magic power. Then, she asked again, “Do you know how to ride a horse?”</p>
<p>“…Of course.”</p>
<p>I took the reins and led Leines. The sky above was getting brighter.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Sitting on the racing horse, Harin thought, ‘This sharpshooter, his horse-riding skill is better than I imagined. I’ve never seen anyone handle Leines so well.’</p>
<p>—Hiiing!</p>
<p>With a cry, Leines suddenly came to a stop. Kim Hajin pulled the reins back and spoke, “It seems we’re here.”</p>
<p>“…Already?”</p>
<p>Harin hid her surprise and looked around. A sky-high mountain range filled the distant view. From the duchy to Lorio Mountain Range, only 40 minutes had passed. Their travel speed was incredible.</p>
<p>“You’re right.”</p>
<p>Harin hopped down from Leines’s back and undid the reins and saddle. Knowing what it meant, Leines shook his head and clacked his hooves. Unfortunately, Leines’s journey would end here.</p>
<p>“…You can go now.”</p>
<p>Leines stomped the ground, clearly expressing reluctance.</p>
<p>Harin consoled Leines, “You did well to get me here. You’re a excellent horse, so you’ll be able to live happily with an owner of your choice…”</p>
<p>With that, Harin stood at the entrance of the mountain range. “Let’s go.” She spoke with determination.</p>
<p>I looked at her and nodded my head, “I’ll take the lead.”</p>
<p>The first mountain we had to overcome was ‘Ploriun’. It was just like any other mountain until the 2000-meter mark. Any higher and a bone-chilling cold filled the air.</p>
<p>“Will you?” Harin still seemed to have doubts but asked in a nicer tone than the first time we met.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I have good eyesight.” I answered with confidence.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>24 hours afterwards, 2350-meter mark of Ploriun.</p>
<p>“Haa… Haa….”</p>
<p>I was currently lying on a cold rock halfway up the mountain. Climbing the mountain was easy thanks to Parkour, but the problem was with my stamina. After all, I had climbed the mountain without stopping for 24 hours.</p>
<p>[Your stamina increases by 0.3 points.]</p>
<p>[Your vitality increases by 0.2 points.]</p>
<p>[Your strength increases by 0.2 points.]</p>
<p>[Your stamina increases by 0.1 points.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Of course, my stats were rising rapidly as well. Harin said it would take at least three months to get over the mountain range, so by the end, my stats should be mostly recovered as well.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Harin looked down at me and asked.</p>
<p>I nodded my head silently.</p>
<p>“Your stamina is better than I thought.” Harin murmured. Then, she examined the grass in the area and harvested some of it. She also picked up some sticks that could serve as kindling and put them in her bag.</p>
<p>As I kept staring at her, she even took the time to explain, “We have to gather as many herbs, kindling, and food as possible. The forest will disappear once we get up into the extreme cold.”</p>
<p>“… I see.” I nodded my head and raised my body.</p>
<p>Harin gave me a strange look.</p>
<p>“You’re done resting already?”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Ah, yes, let’s go.”</p>
<p>My stats went up as I used up stamina, so it was better to keep myself a little tired.</p>
<p>We picked up our bags and began to climb the mountain once more. As we got further up, the greenery on the ground disappeared, replaced with icy dirt. The chilling temperature cut into my skin like blades.</p>
<p>But with [Random Consolidation System] boosting the heat-resistant property of my clothes, I was able to endure the cold better.</p>
<p>I looked at Harin. She was enduring the cold with qi reinforcement. Seeing this, I was reminded of her setting, [Devil Hunter].</p>
<p>She was undoubtedly an important character in this world. She probably had an important role in fighting Baal. Without doubt, she was someone I had to keep safe.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa.”</p>
<p>Once we reached the 4000-meter mark, the extreme chill became too harsh to endure. I had no choice but to strengthen my equipment with Stigma’s magic power.</p>
<p>“Are we going the right way? I can trust you, right?” At that moment, Harin asked. Her voice was frigid with cold.</p>
<p>“Yes, just follow me.” I replied confidently. But perhaps my tone provoked the mountain, as snow-white snowflakes began to pour down.</p>
<p>It was a whiteout. Harin shouted immediately.</p>
<p>“It’s a snowstorm! Be careful!”</p>
<p>Harin headed to the opposite direction as she said that. The person who told me to be careful was lost herself. She had lost her sense of direction from the whiteout.</p>
<p>Seeing her heading towards a cliff, I grabbed her wrist and pulled her back strongly.</p>
<p>“Ah! W-Who is it—! Is it you—?!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me. I can hear you fine, so you don’t have to shout. Just follow my lead.”</p>
<p>This snowstorm even had magic power mixed in the air, making it all the more difficult to endure.</p>
<p>“Whew… I see a cave over there.”</p>
<p>Considering how long we climbed without rest, no one would curse us for taking a break here.</p>
<p>I began to walk to a natural cave about 500 meters away.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>28 hours since the beginning of climbing, a cave in Ploriun Mountain.</p>
<p><em>Tk— Tj—</em></p>
<p>A campfire burned as three skewered fish cooked above it. Harin smacked her lips and swallowed her saliva as she watched the fish.</p>
<p>When I stared at her, she murmured as if to give an excuse, “…It’s been a while since I’ve had meat.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Campfires leave behind tracks.”</p>
<p>“Mm… You’ve been on the run for a long time?”</p>
<p>Harin flinched. Her eyes trembled as though they were having an internal earthquake. Soon, she let out a deep sigh and spoke honestly, “…Yes, I’m on the run. That’s why I chose this mountain range.”</p>
<p>“Why are you running away?”</p>
<p>“…It’s better that you don’t know. In case I get captured, that is.”</p>
<p>With that, Harin picked up a skewer. I was a bit disappointed that I didn’t get to hear the full story but gave up and left it for another day. I looked outside the cave. The snowstorm was showing no signs of ending.</p>
<p>I turned back to Harin.</p>
<p><em>Nom, nom—</em></p>
<p>She was busy eating the fish. She finished it in the blink of an eye and then looked at me with satisfied yet suspicious eyes.</p>
<p>“…By the way.” Harin sat tall. Her tone was serious. “Are you really an F-rank soldier?”</p>
<p>I replied with a grin, “You’ve seen the report.”</p>
<p>“…An F-rank soldier can’t possibly endure Ploriun’s extreme cold.”</p>
<p>What she was saying made sense, but I just gave the same answer she did.</p>
<p>“It’s better than you don’t know.”</p>
<p>It was then. A new alert popped up in front of me.</p>
<p>[A core character of this world, Devil Hunter Harin, takes interest in you.]</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Harin closed her mouth. After that, we didn’t talk to each other and just stared at the snowstorm outside the cave. Soon, Harin glanced at me and handed me a skewer. I told her she could have it.</p>
<p>“I have another question.” Harin asked as she nibbled on the fish, “Why did you join Lorenzio’s army?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a question I had the answer to. I wanted to stay quiet, but a good idea suddenly popped up in my head.</p>
<p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
<p>With a cough, I leaned against the cave wall and set the atmosphere. I put on a solemn expression and made myself look a little nervous. Then, in the heavy atmosphere, I muttered.</p>
<p>“To beat up a devil, maybe?”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Harin’s body shook strongly. She stared at me with widened eyes. I wanted to feel out the title [Devil Hunter]. It worked even better than I thought.</p>
<p>“…Devil?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I replied nonchalantly to her question. It didn’t matter what she asked from here. Her investigation found that I was an orphan. No one knew my background before I came to the orphanage. In other words, I was free to make things up as I pleased.</p>
<p>“You….”</p>
<p>Harin swallowed hard and asked again, “Do you believe that devils exist?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, I put on the best act imaginable. I clenched my teeth and fists so that my veins would show and pushed my hair back roughly.</p>
<p>Harin carefully observed my reaction.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I maintained silence and shook my head. It was clear what I meant. Unable to wait, Harin approached me.</p>
<p>“Tell me. Do you believe in the existence of devils?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I gave her a sharper glare, clearly asking her not to ask any further. But Harin didn’t back down. We got into a staring contest for a few minutes, then I muttered as though I was giving up.</p>
<p>“When I turned six… it killed my family.”</p>
<p>Harin’s face turned stiff. She was most likely thinking about the family background she read in the report about me.</p>
<p>“A human turned into a horned monster and killed everyone.”</p>
<p>I tried to act angry.</p>
<p>“Devil is the only way I can describe him.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Harin fell silent. She backed off. In the dark cave, she closed her eyes and pondered. Soon, she nodded her head with a sad expression.</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>She seemed to have reached an understanding as she spoke with confidence.</p>
<p>“I understand now.”</p>
<p>I looked at her. She looked content and was staring at me like looking at a comrade.</p>
<p>“I understand why Airun sent you to me.”</p>
<p>Just like that, she took the bait.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 320. A New Path (3)</p>
<p>[Republic of Leores]</p>
<p>Beyond the Demon Realm Gate was a world full of mystery.</p>
<p>Three kingdoms and one republic stood on the continent of ‘Kruni’. In this unfortunate world soon to be destroyed, Kim Suho was a sword commander of the Republic.</p>
<p>“…So, you’re saying that Baal is going to destroy this world?”</p>
<p>Currently in the office of the sword commander, Aileen, wearing a somewhat worn-out uniform, asked Kim Suho. In this world, she was a maid to a high-ranking politician of the Republic.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“And we have to stop Baal to pass the Gate’s test?”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded and handed Aileen a book. Aileen frowned the moment she saw it.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“It’s an item I got as a reward for clearing a quest.”</p>
<p>“Quest? Oh, right, I have a quest, too. What was your quest?”</p>
<p>“I had to enlighten the president’s daughter in the way of the sword.”</p>
<p>“…What kind of a quest is that?”</p>
<p>Aileen grumbled and received the book. The words [Summary of the Past and the Future to Come] were written across its front cover.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>But the moment she opened the book, her face once again distorted into a frown. There were nothing but blank pages inside.</p>
<p>“What the heck. I don’t see anything.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho widened his eyes in surprise, but soon understood what was going on.</p>
<p>“Ah, I guess I’m the only one who can read it.”</p>
<p>“What? Why?”</p>
<p>“…Here, let me read you the most important chapters.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho recited the book slowly enough for Aileen to understand.</p>
<p>“First of all, this world is also currently under the process of Demon Realm Transformation. Fortunately the people of this world discovered a type of ore called ‘purification crystal’ and the progress has slowed down….”</p>
<p>To summarize the ‘past’ part of the book— the people of Kruni had successfully averted Demon Realm Transformation, all thanks to ‘purification crystals’ and ‘devil hunters’.</p>
<p>“…Devil hunters?”</p>
<p>Aileen opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Yes, they’re humans who are particularly strong against devils. Devil hunters can inflict deadly damage to devils, whether the devil has descended or remains in the incarnation body.”</p>
<p>According to the book, devil hunters of this world had already murdered a total of 8 devils.</p>
<p>Aileen shrugged and said, “Well, to me it sounds like stopping Baal would be awfully easy, then.”</p>
<p>“No. The next part is the important part.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho read the next paragraph out loud.</p>
<p>“…As the damage continued to escalate, the devils decided to stir up divisions between humans. Baal possessed the prince of Arunheim and ousted the clan of Leon, whose members had been devil hunters for generations. The eldest daughter of the Leon clan, Harin Von Leon, attempted to escape to the Republic but failed and was murdered…. Two months later, Baal descended.”</p>
<p>‘Baal’, the strongest devil of all.</p>
<p>In the face of the malicious god armed with overwhelming force, the world without its shield—the devil hunters— crumbled easily.</p>
<p>“Baal…,” Aileen muttered, “So, we only have 2 more months left.”</p>
<p>“Two months and three days. The world was destroyed in 3 days after Baal descended.”</p>
<p>“What? 3 days? Seriously?”</p>
<p>Aileen’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>Even Orden couldn’t have destroyed the world in just 72 hours.</p>
<p>“Yes, it took him 71 hours in total.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Aileen started biting her fingernails subconsciously. Kim Suho let out a small sigh as he watched Aileen chew.</p>
<p>“Aileen-ssi, quit your job and become my maid.”</p>
<p>“…What? Your maid? Are you out of your mind?”</p>
<p>“We don’t have any choice here. The most important thing right now is for us to stick together. Also, we have to restore our power and Gifts.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shrugged. He had only managed to locate Aileen so far, but as sword commander, he could mobilize as many informants as he wanted. That was how he found Aileen in the first place.</p>
<p>With the right composite sketches, he was confident it wouldn’t take him too long to find the others.</p>
<p>“First, I’m going to gather our party and save the eldest daughter of the Leon clan.”</p>
<p>“…Save her? Isn’t she already dead?”</p>
<p>Aileen asked doubtingly, to which Kim Suho grinned.</p>
<p>“Who knows? There are 198 more people like us in this world, after all.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Lotio Mountains, the peak of Ploriun]</p>
<p>We reached the peak of Ploriun. Due to the severe cold of -50 degrees, we felt as if our bodies were splitting in half but got used to it over time. Harin and I exchanged glances and then started going down the mountain.</p>
<p>“Six more peaks this size and we’ll reach the Republic,” Harin said, leaving footsteps across the white snowfield.</p>
<p>I remarked sarcastically, “Thank god.”</p>
<p>“…Hang in there.”</p>
<p>Harin gave a small smile. She seemed much more comfortable around me after the incident back at the cave.</p>
<p>“Oh, and… the one who murdered your family was probably a Djinn, not a devil.”</p>
<p>Harin whisphered, walking closely behind me. Her tone was cautious.</p>
<p>I threw a glance at Harin.</p>
<p>“…You’ve been thinking about what I said this whole time?”</p>
<p>“Of course I was. How could I not?”</p>
<p>Harin smiled, and I continued to walk.</p>
<p>The climb down was much easier than the climb up.</p>
<p>After 3 hours, I could feel the cold dissipate.</p>
<p>Wild boars, hawks, and monsters such as Yeti began to appear, but Harin and I hunted them down with our sword and crossbow. The boars and the hawks were especially great food items, and we stored them in Harin’s spatial pocket.</p>
<p>“…Wait.”</p>
<p>However, when we reached the midpoint, I felt a faint presence.</p>
<p>The owner of the presence was spying on us, so he or she was definitely not a monster. Or a passerby, for that matter. What kind of person would climb this mountain voluntarily?</p>
<p>There was only one conclusion.</p>
<p>“…Take out your sword.”</p>
<p>Harin did as she was told. <em>sssk—</em> The sound of metal colliding against the sword sheath rang out.</p>
<p>I took out my crossbow and fitted a bolt against the bowstring. <em>Kiiik—</em> The sound of bolt and bowstring rubbing against each other rang out.</p>
<p>There was no such thing as a secret in a place so quiet and so open as this mountain range. Just as we noticed their presences, the enemies must have noticed our hostility.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>Six assassins in white robes jumped out from below the snow-covered hills and above the barren trees.</p>
<p>Their target was clearly us.</p>
<p>“…It’s Icarus,” Harin muttered as she glared at the enemies. She sounded angry and troubled.</p>
<p>“Icarus? What’s that?”</p>
<p>“They’re a group of assassins who work for Arunheim’s royal family in secret. Looks like they’ve been waiting for us to arrive.”</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>I nodded and looked at the assassins surrounding us.</p>
<p>It would be hard for me in my current state to handle all of them.</p>
<p>…At that moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly something strange happened. One of the assassins looked at me and began trembling.</p>
<p>Confused, I turned my gaze to the assassin.</p>
<p>The assassin was too small to be a man and had black hair poking out of her robe.</p>
<p>Finally she called my name.</p>
<p>“…Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>My eyes widened. I saw through the assassin’s robe.</p>
<p>The woman underneath the robe, whose eyes were sparkling like obsidians in surprise, was none other than Boss.</p>
<p>“Boss?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes! It’s me!”</p>
<p>She nodded hastily and, one step, two step, three step… slowly approached me.</p>
<p>The other assassins looked bewildered. Surely they had no idea what was happening.</p>
<p>When Boss got near enough, I whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>—What are you doing here?</p>
<p>—…I don’t know. I was with them when I woke up.</p>
<p>—Ah, really?</p>
<p>Boss probably became an assassin the same way I became an F-rank sharpshooter. I glanced at the assassins over Boss’s shoulder. They were still frozen in confusion.</p>
<p>“W-What’s going on? Have you been working with them this whole time?” Harin yelled in shock.</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, of course not, I’m on your side.”</p>
<p>I shook my head and pulled Boss towards me. The fight just went from 2-6 to 3-5. Now everything felt more balanced.</p>
<p>“…Boss?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>I whispered, “Could you take care of them?”</p>
<p>Boss nodded with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“How much of your abilities have your recovered?”</p>
<p>“I’ve still got a ways to go, but….”</p>
<p>Suddenly a dark shadow rose from behind Boss. The shadow turned into sharp blades that resembled the legs of a spider.</p>
<p>“I can take care of them.”</p>
<p>The shadow blades flew towards the assassins, and the assassins stepped back in bewilderment. Only the leader of the assassins came forward.</p>
<p>“…Aiken! Just what are you doing-”</p>
<p>“My name is not Aiken.”</p>
<p>However, Boss had no intention of listening to him.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaak—!</em> She wielded her shadow, and the blades swiftly penetrated the assassins.</p>
<p><em>Chwaak….</em> Scarlet blood splattered on the snowfield.</p>
<p>Watching the scene unfold, Harin dropped her sword by mistake.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>A campsite on Ploriun, 1300 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>We decided to take a break before moving on to the second mountain, 'Lokio.' The tent was stored in Harin's spatial pocket, and it was my responsibility to set it up.</p>
<p>“…How do you two know each other? You called her ‘Boss’. Were you members of the same squad?”</p>
<p>Inside the cozy tent, Harin looked at me and Boss in turn. I could only shrug at her question.</p>
<p>“She’s a friend of mine from home. Don’t worry, she’ll be a great addition to our team.”</p>
<p>Despite my word of honor, Harin still looked uneasy. I glanced at Boss, and she put her hand on Harin’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Worry not. I'll protecteth thee.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Why was she speaking like that? I suppressed my laughter. Harin also frowned in suspicion, but soon nodded with a sigh.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I have a choice…. I’m tired. Let’s get some rest,” Harin remarked bitterly and lay down on the tent floor.</p>
<p>Boss pointed at Harin and mouthed a silent question.</p>
<p>—Who is this woman?</p>
<p>I answered.</p>
<p>—An important client. She’s a devil hunter.</p>
<p>—Devil hunter?</p>
<p>—Yes. I’ll explain the details later.</p>
<p>“Enough with the silent conversation,” I said with a smile, “We should get some sleep, too.”</p>
<p>I was exhausted, which was only natural considering I climbed a 5000m tall mountain in just 3 days.</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>Boss nodded, and I lay down on the tent floor.</p>
<p>“Huaam~”</p>
<p>With a big yawn, I closed my eyes.</p>
<p><em>Ssk— ssk—</em></p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, however, I heard a sound. I opened my eyes and saw Boss spreading her blanket and getting ready to lie down next to me.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Our eyes met, and we stared at each other in silence.</p>
<p>It was Boss who first let out a dry cough and said, “…There’s not much space.”</p>
<p><em>Zzz— Zzz—</em> It was then that we heard Harin snoring. I glanced at Harin to make sure she was asleep and nodded.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, it’s okay. Please lie down. I’m going to let it slide this time.”</p>
<p>“Slide…? …Well then.”</p>
<p>Slightly bothered by my choice of words, Boss lay down next to me sulkily. Just as Boss had said the tent was very small, and my shoulders touched hers as we lay next to each other.</p>
<p>…10 minutes passed by in absolute stillness.</p>
<p>I was tired but couldn’t sleep for some reason. Because I couldn’t sleep, I turned to my side. There, Boss lay straight like a vampire in a coffin, her eyes closed.</p>
<p>“Boss, are you sleeping?”</p>
<p>No answer. She seemed to have fallen asleep as soon as she lay down, even though she said at one point that she didn’t need sleep.</p>
<p>With a smile on my lips, I stared at Boss.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Was it because I hadn’t seen her for long? Or perhaps it was because I met her at such an unexpected place that I felt extra glad to see her? She looked prettier tonight than usual.</p>
<p>I slowly reached for her hair. I brushed the soft, silky strands with my hand.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Still no response from Boss. I proceeded to pinch her cheek.</p>
<p>Streeetch— Her cheek stretched easily. It was so soft and tender that I felt as if I was touching a mocchi. I could get addicted to this.</p>
<p>As I continued to play with Boss’s cheek….</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Boss opened her eyes.</p>
<p>She turned her head to the side and looked at me and my fingers alternately.</p>
<p>I slowly let go of her cheek.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” asked Boss.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh… nothing. It’s just that….”</p>
<p>I smiled at Boss and stretched my hand towards her head. Then I picked up a leaf that had been stuck in her hair.</p>
<p>“You had a little something there.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Still Boss looked at me without a word, and I too looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>Our gazes stayed intertwined for a long time— long enough for me to notice that her hair and clothing were disheveled.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>Her scent penetrated me from a close distance.</p>
<p>I could feel her breath on my nose.</p>
<p>Her red lips came into my view.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I was consumed with a certain desire.</p>
<p>—Gulp.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard.</p>
<p>My heart started beating fast—</p>
<p>And I moved without thinking.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 321. A New Path (4)</p>
<p>I reached out to Boss. My crude hand touched her cheek, and I could feel the softness of her skin on my calluses. Seeing the calluses I got while cocking the crossbow, bitterness rose up within me.</p>
<p>I had gotten more used to this world than I imagined.</p>
<p>With that, the urge within me disappeared, replaced by an unknown stuffiness.</p>
<p>But this time, Boss moved. Her cold yet warm hand grasped mine and kept it from shaking.</p>
<p>We looked at each other with our hand held together. Neither of us said a word, surrounding us in a strange atmosphere.</p>
<p>I slowly approached her, close enough to touch her completely.</p>
<p>My heart beat loudly. I could also hear the beats that didn’t belong to me. Was she just as nervous as I was? I felt a little embarrassed and happy at the same time.</p>
<p>Just as our breath mixed together and our lips were about to touch…</p>
<p>“Kuhum.”</p>
<p>An intentional cough rang out.</p>
<p>The romantic mood disappeared, and we widened our eyes in surprise.</p>
<p><em>Gulp—</em> I swallowed hard and stared at the corner of the tent. Harin was taking up two people’s worth of space. It was only then that I realized how close Boss and I were.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I scooched away with a bitter smile. Boss was still expressionless, but she glared at Harin somewhat aggressively.</p>
<p>“I’m tired~”</p>
<p>I murmured loudly and lied down. I stretched my arms out and stared at the ceiling of the tent. My heart was still thumping, and a smile lingered on my face. Nothing really happened, but I was in a good mood.</p>
<p>I quickly decided to fall asleep while this feeling lasted. With the end not far away, I wanted to enjoy every moment I could.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>But soon afterward, I felt something pressing down my arm. I opened my eyes curiously and saw Boss’s head over my arm. She was using my arm as a pillow.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell whether she was really asleep or just pretending. Regardless, I turned back to the ceiling with a smirk.</p>
<p>It was a bit uncomfortable, but I didn’t mind. Boss’s head was so small that it was barely heavy anyways.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Climbing past the second peak, ‘Lokio’, we arrived at the third peak, ‘Kilata’.</p>
<p>Kilata’s environment was that of a jungle. All sorts of threats, from monsters like giant mosquitos, elemental snakes, crimson monkeys, and king alligators to quicksand swamps and magic-eating plants, filled the mountain.</p>
<p>But with Boss’s strength and my eyesight, the hellish mountain was manageable. I found out that Boss didn’t lose too much of her strength because her background was set as an assassin.</p>
<p>“Kilata really is more difficult than the previous mountains. It’s worse than I imagined.” Harin murmured.</p>
<p>We were currently at the midpoint of the mountain. It had taken us five days to get to the 3500-meter mark. In comparison, Ploriun and Lokio had taken us only two and four days to climb, respectively.</p>
<p>“Just finding a place to stay the night is annoying here.”</p>
<p>Kilata didn’t have caves, and with the sheer number of monsters inhabiting it, sleeping on the ground was impossible. We had to sleep in the sky or not sleep at all.</p>
<p>As my stats recovered to an extent this past week, I could build a shack even with my eyes closed. With plenty of wood around us, I easily built treehouses with a little bit of Stigma’s magic power.</p>
<p>“I’ve already seen it multiple times, but… your craftsmanship really is inhuman…”</p>
<p>Harin muttered as she looked around the shack I built. I laughed inwardly. This one was my best work yet.</p>
<p>“I’m a descendant of the dwarves.”</p>
<p>“Dwarves?”</p>
<p>“Yep, I’m not kidding either.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Harin blinked her eyes in a daze. I wasn’t sure whether she was in disbelief or trying to come to terms with what she just heard, but it seemed she had heard of dwarves as well.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Boss arrived with a strong gust of wind. She was in charge of procuring food, and she arrived with bird meat and berries in her hands.</p>
<p>“Do these look edible?”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>According to Observation and Reading, the bird meat was a delicacy named [Licor], and the berries were simply labeled [Delicious Tropical Fruit].</p>
<p>I seasoned the bird meat and put up a campfire. Once the fire was going, I skewered the bird meat and put it over the fire.</p>
<p>Six skewers finished in the blink of an eye. I gave two to each person and presented the berries as dessert.</p>
<p>We finished the meal in just 15 minutes.</p>
<p>“It’s getting dark.”</p>
<p>Darkness descended early in the swampland. Although it was only five in the afternoon, we were enshrouded in darkness.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the meal. Should we rest a bit now?”</p>
<p>Harin leaned against the wooden wall as she rubbed her belly.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>I spread out the bedding I made with soft leaves I found in the jungle. Harin lied down immediately, I lied down across from her, and Boss lied down next to me. Boss then turned to me and stared at me fixedly. It seemed she was asking to use my arm as a pillow again.</p>
<p>“…You guys.”</p>
<p>But Harin suddenly opened her mouth. Boss and I flinched subconsciously.</p>
<p>“W-What’s up?”</p>
<p>“You said you believed that devils exist, right?”</p>
<p>Harin sounded serious, so I strained my ears. I could tell instnctively that this was an important piece of information.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then do you remember the incident from a month ago?”</p>
<p>“…Incident?”</p>
<p>“The Loren noble clan was destroyed for committing treason. You know, for spreading that the prince was an incarnation body of a devil.”</p>
<p>This was the first time I was hearing about this, but I nodded my head.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>
<p>“…It’s hard not to have heard anything.”</p>
<p>Harin paused and let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“…It’s not a lie.” She continued more seriously than before. “Arunheim’s prince, Krisbell, houses the devil, Baal, in his body.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I listened to Harin quietly and reflected on what she said. Then, something she said caught my attention.</p>
<p>Arunheim’s prince, Krisbell.</p>
<p>Baal’s incarnation body.</p>
<p>Krisbell and Baal.</p>
<p>Kris… ‘bell’.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>I turned to Boss with my eyes wide open. Boss seemed to have realized something too as she had a shocked expression.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Arunheim’s Palace – ‘Arun’]</p>
<p>Arunheim Kingdom was a major superpower in the continent along with the Republic of Leores. Although it advocated a clear caste system, it had something called the Common Promotion System, which allowed talented commoners to rise in status. Some called it ‘the kingdom where the shackles of slaves were the most beautiful’.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stepped into the heart of Arunheim Kingdom – the palace, Arun. She walked through the ostentatious halls of the palace and reached the most decorated place of the palace, the king’s quarters.</p>
<p>“…This is your past?”</p>
<p>Jewels and ornaments adorned the room. Selling just the king’s quarter seemed enough to buy a castle.</p>
<p>“Foolish and arrogant.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered as she looked around the palace. Although she couldn’t protect her country as a king, she had never once let herself loose in luxury.</p>
<p>“Yep, this is me.”</p>
<p>Bell answered, sitting on the corner of his bed. His outfit was different from what he wore on Earth. He had a gown engraved with gold with enchanted bracelets around his wrists and enchanted rings on his fingers. Bell called them the ‘greatest treasures in the kingdom’.</p>
<p>“Royalty from a ruined world and the incarnation body of Baal. That’s who I am. A bit complicated, right?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at Bell and let out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>“…So I have to kill you here?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet.” Bell shook his head. But looking forward to his death, he was full of smiles.</p>
<p>“There are two months left, so you don’t have to rush it. Baal will descend the moment you kill me. I’m sure you need time to prepare.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked around the room again. Although countless treasure and jewels filled the room, none looked used.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned to Bell once again.</p>
<p>“…I’m curious about something.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, go ahead. I’m about to die. As long as I don’t have to repeat the past, I can answer any question you have.”</p>
<p>Bell truly looked relieved.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked in a small voice, “How did you become Baal’s incarnation body?”</p>
<p>Hearing her question, Bell’s face stiffened a bit. However, his smile quickly returned.</p>
<p>“…There was someone I wanted to see one more time, even if I had to sell my soul to a devil.”</p>
<p>“Sell your soul?” Jin Sahyuk frowned.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Humans all have something they want. For you, it would be returning in time.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s eyes widened. Returning in time was a phenomenon that transcended miracles. To go back while maintaining one’s memories, the only person to have done such a thing was Earth’s Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>“…Returning in time?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, I’m a Returner. In exchange for going back in time once, I gave my soul to Baal.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk found it hard to understand. She furrowed her brows and glared at Bell. Meeting her gaze, Bell smiled thinly.</p>
<p>It was then. <em>Kiik—</em> The door opened and another man walked in.</p>
<p>“…So you’re Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned to the direction of the voice. Standing there was a man with a sharp expression. Jin Sahyuk knew he had to be ‘Yi Yeonjun’.</p>
<p>“That’s right. And you’re what… his boyfriend?” Jin Sahyuk smirked and pointed to Bell. Yi Yeonjun frowned, and, unlike himself, Bell shot up with a flustered look.</p>
<p>“No, no, of course not. That’s not even funny.”</p>
<p>Bell pulled on Jin Sahyuk’s shoulders. Until then, Yi Yeonjun kept glaring at Jin Sahyuk and Jin Sahyuk glared back.</p>
<p>“Calm down, both of you. This meeting is so that we can peacefully discuss how to achieve what each of us wants.”</p>
<p>Bell seated Yi Yeonjun and Jin Sahyuk and began something akin to a ‘meeting’.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Same time, in the house of a noble family, ‘Pritun’, located some distance away from Arunheim’s capital, Shin Jonghak and Chae Nayun were together.</p>
<p>“So this Loren Clan spread the false rumor that the prince was a devil?”</p>
<p>“Yes, now you understand.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Chae Nayun finally understood, Shin Jonghak clapped and nodded his head. In this world, Shin Jonghak was a successor of the Pritun Clan, and Chae Nayun was his knight.</p>
<p>“Hm… but why would the Loren Clan spread such a rumor? It’s obvious what would happen to them.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak answered with confidence, “Probably because they were housing a devil. They were about to be found out, so they spread that rumor in a futile attempt to draw the attention away from them. Our clan received orders to kill the devil that escaped from their clan.”</p>
<p>“<em>Our</em> clan? Really?”</p>
<p>“Who cares? It’s nice being a noble.” Shin Jonghak grinned.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun made a vomiting gesture and then asked again, “So… we have to catch the devil that escaped?”</p>
<p>“Right, catching and killing that devil is the first trial of the Demon Realm Gate.”</p>
<p>“Hm… it’s surprisingly simple.”</p>
<p>…Although they were far from the truth, Chae Nayun and Shin Jonghak looked at each other seriously and nodded their heads. From a third-party perspective, their analysis was truly cute.</p>
<p>“Alright, well, now that I know the ultimate goal, I’m going to go train.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh… How much power have you recovered?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak grabbed Chae Nayun as she was about to leave. He didn’t want to let her go. Now that she was a member of his clan, he wanted her to be with him as long as possible.</p>
<p>“I’ll be back to normal in a month.” Chae Nayun answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“Then what’s your quest?”</p>
<p>“Recovering my strength is my quest.”</p>
<p>“And the reward?”</p>
<p>“My weapon, Balmung. …Why are you asking me all this?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, well… because you’re my knight.”</p>
<p>“I think you’re too into this. Snap out of it.” Chae Nayun got up with a scowl.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak wanted her to stay, so he asked another question, “Wait. Have you thought of ways to contact others?”</p>
<p>“How would I do that? This world doesn’t even have a phone….”</p>
<p>But at that moment, Chae Nayun remembered the 8-star card, [Infinite Communication]. She couldn’t help but wonder if it worked in this world.</p>
<p>“No, wait, maybe I do have a way.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun closed her eyes. Then, she focused on sending a telepathic message to the person she was most familiar with – ‘Extra 7’.</p>
<p>—Hey, can you hear me? It’s me, Chae Nayun. Reply if you can hear me.</p>
<p>“…Gulp.”</p>
<p>5 seconds… 10 seconds… 15 seconds… 20 seconds… 1 minute… 3 minutes…</p>
<p>Time passed, and no answer returned.</p>
<p>“…Guess it doesn’t work.” Chae Nayun smacked her lips and turned back. “Looks like we’ll have to go look for them directly.”</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>[Chae Nayun? Is it really you?]</p>
<p>Extra 7 replied.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 322. Break-Even Point (1)</p>
<p>[Mount Kilata]</p>
<p>We reached the summit of Mount Kilata, about 5120 meters high. The view at the top looked nothing like that of other mountains. The rule that ‘the higher the altitude, the lower the temperature’ was ignored due to the magic power phenomena and Kilata maintained a high-temperature humid jungle scene even at its peak.</p>
<p>“…We have 3 more peaks left,” Harin muttered, looking down at the scenery below. This meant that we had to climb 4 more mountains just like Kilata before we arrive at our destination, the Republic. I dragged myself up to my feet with a sigh.</p>
<p>“Should we get going, then?”</p>
<p>Harin glanced at Boss. Boss nodded, looking off into the distance.</p>
<p>“Yes. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>We started walking again, through Kilata’s dense forest and swamps, slaying monsters as they came.</p>
<p>An hour later, the mountain scenery changed a bit.</p>
<p>“…Fog?”</p>
<p>Thick, dense fog blocked our view. It first stayed low around our ankles but soon ballooned in size and covered the entirety of Kilata in less than 30 minutes. Unable to see through the barricade, Harin and Boss stopped.</p>
<p>Harin said calmly, ”It looks like Mirinae’s fog drifted down here.”</p>
<p>“…Mirinae?”</p>
<p>“Yes. ‘Mirinae’, also known as the mountain of fog. I’ve heard of its nickname but never imagined the fog would be this thick….”</p>
<p>Harin bit her lower lip.</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>I grabbed Harin and Boss’s hands.</p>
<p>Not even a fog this thick could stop the Thousand-Mile Eyes. I could see clearly through the fog.</p>
<p>“I’ve got great eyesight.”</p>
<p>I walked on, holding the pair’s hands. Harin followed me awkwardly and Boss let me lead her willingly.</p>
<p>As we descended the mountain, I began to think of this fog as more of a blessing than a curse. The fog not only blocked our view but also that of the countless monsters living on Kilata.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fog, our descent proceeded at a very quick pace. As we advanced the fog became thicker, but it took us less than 3 hours to travel from the peak to the midpoint.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>[Hey, can you hear me?]</p>
<p>I heard a voice.</p>
<p>I stopped with a shudder.</p>
<p>[It’s me, Chae Nayun. If you can hear me, answer me.]</p>
<p>It was Chae Nayun’s voice. My guess was that she was contacting me through her 8-star card.</p>
<p>“…Hajin?”</p>
<p>Confused, Boss and Harin looked at me as I attempted to think up my reply. However, I found it difficult to form sentences in my head. This world’s rejective force was probably disrupting the card’s communication.</p>
<p>I couldn’t form long sentences and barely managed to send a short one.</p>
<p>[Chae Nayun, is it really you?]</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin? Is there something up ahead?”</p>
<p>“Uh, no.”</p>
<p>Boss prodded and I began walking again. After 3 minutes, I received a reply from Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>[Yeah it’s me. You’re also inside the Gate, right?]</p>
<p>I replied as I walked.</p>
<p>[Yeah. I’m on my way to the Republic of Leores with the daughter of the Leon clan.]</p>
<p>Again, it took her 3 minutes to get back to me.</p>
<p>[What? But she’s a devil. Why are you going to Leores? Turn back and bring her here!]</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>‘What the hell is she talking about?’</p>
<p>I tilted my head in confusion.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Republic of Leores, training room in the basement of the presidential residence.]</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked at the woman in front of him holding an iron sword. Her posture was flawless and the magic power surrounding her sword was sharp.</p>
<p>Kim Suho couldn’t help but be amazed by his student’s growth. The president’s daughter instantly absorbed everything he taught her like a dry sponge.</p>
<p>“You’re growing fast.”</p>
<p>Despite Kim Suho’s heartfelt praise, the president’s daughter, Seraine, did not smile and remained focused on her training.</p>
<p>“Hi-yah!”</p>
<p>She swung her sword with all her strength. The magic power from her sword scratched the surface of the floor as it rushed towards Kim Suho, but Kim Suho easily sliced it in half.</p>
<p>“Your magic power is as hard as steel. You’ve really achieved a lot, considering your magic power was just a breeze when we first began.”</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>Without a word, Seraine dashed towards Kim Suho. <em>Tat—!</em> She covered a distance of 100 meters with a single jump.</p>
<p>Seraine slammed her sword down and Kim Suho blocked her attack with his sword. Sparks broke out at the point of contact.</p>
<p><em>Kiik— Kiik—</em></p>
<p>“…I hear you have a favor to ask of me,” Seraine said as their swords clashed.</p>
<p>Kim Suho broke into a smile. His efforts were about to bear fruit.</p>
<p>“Are you finally acknowledging me?”</p>
<p>“…I’m not acknowledging anything—”</p>
<p>Seraine focused her magic power around her arms. This immediately increased her muscle power, but nonetheless, she wasn’t able to push Kim Suho away. Seraine pushed and pushed, hoping to bounce Kim Suho off, but stopped when she realized it wasn’t going to happen.</p>
<p>“Haa…. I’ve merely realized that the rumors were wrong.”</p>
<p>Seraine was known throughout the continent as a prodigy even before she met Kim Suho. In contrast, Kim Suho was rumored to be incompetent. Everyone claimed that he only became the sword commander through connections.</p>
<p>“Is that so? Thank you.”</p>
<p>In the first place, the reason Seraine asked Kim Suho to teach her the sword was that she regarded him as her father’s flaw. She planned to embarrass Kim Suho by beating him in a sword fight, kick him out, and appoint a more fitting person to the position of sword commander.</p>
<p>However, to her surprise, Kim Suho was nothing like what she had imagined— unlike the rumors, he was strong. His sword and magic power couldn’t be more harmonious.</p>
<p>Faced with his flawless way of the sword, Seraine felt the desire to ‘learn’ from somebody for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>“No need. So, what is this favor that you- Ah!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Kim Suho struck the back of Seraine’s foot with his sword. Serraine was thrown into the air.</p>
<p>But she had been in this kind of situation hundreds of times before.</p>
<p>She did a backflip in midair and escaped from Kim Suho’s reach. Her movements were natural as if she was starring in a circus.</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked at Seraine proudly and remarked, “I’ve heard that there’s a clan called ‘Leon’ in the northern kingdom.”</p>
<p>“…Leon?”</p>
<p>Seraine loosened her grip around her sword.</p>
<p>Kim Suho continued calmly, “Yes, they’ve been falsely accused and exterminated in Arunheim.”</p>
<p>“…I know who they are. What about them?”</p>
<p>“The eldest daughter of the Leon clan is on her way to the Republic.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seraine put her sword back into its sheath. For someone who was as head over heels for swords as her to voluntarily withdraw her sword— Kim Suho knew this was not a good sign.</p>
<p>“I understand what you’re trying to say,” Seraine shook her head adamantly and declared, “But no.”</p>
<p><em>Tak—</em> She snapped her fingers. The door of the training room opened immediately and a crowd of knights entered the training room. They were Seraine’s personal bodyguards.</p>
<p>“Surely you’re aware of our history with Arunheim and of all the sacrifices we had to make to achieve peace with them. I can’t betray my father and the people of this country just to save Leon.”</p>
<p>With that, Seraine left the training room. The flock of knights followed her in a hurry.</p>
<p>“…Sword commander.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a knight dressed in black armor and a cape—‘Lekendol’, Seraine’s highest-ranked bodyguard—turned to Kim Suho. His gaze was full of animosity.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so proud.”</p>
<p>“…Of course.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shrugged. Lekendol grilled Kim Suho some more before finally leaving. Soon after, Aileen entered the training room with Kim Suho’s clothes and a towel in her hands.</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you.”</p>
<p>“…Why are they so rude to you? Want me to beat them up?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled at Aileen’s suggestion.</p>
<p>“Please, calm down. Your abilities haven’t been restored completely yet.”</p>
<p>“Still. She said she was gonna grant you a favor but when you actually tell her what you want, she doesn’t listen? What’s with that?”</p>
<p>“…She doesn’t have a choice. I get it. What’s at stake is her country, after all.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Aileen’s conversation continued, and suddenly….</p>
<p>[Hey Kim Suho!]</p>
<p>…Kim Suho heard a desperate voice. Anyone could tell it was Chae Nayun’s voice. Kim Suho listened up in confusion.</p>
<p>[It’s me, Chae Nayun! Kim Hajin’s in this world, too! Where are you? Answer me!]</p>
<p>‘Ah, this is her 8-star card!’</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled upon realization.</p>
<p>‘Answer… how do I answer a message again?’</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and focused his mind.</p>
<p>—I’m at the Republic of Leores.</p>
<p>3 minutes later.</p>
<p>He heard Chae Nayun’s voice again.</p>
<p>[Thank god! Kim Hajin’s on his way to Leores with Leon right now! You have to meet them!]</p>
<p>‘Kim Hajin is coming here with Leon’s devil hunter.’</p>
<p>Kim Suho opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>“Ah, this is, Seraine-ssi—!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho quickly wiped his sweat off with the towel and darted out of the training room.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[500 meters above sea level, the entrance to Mount Mirinae]</p>
<p>We successfully escaped from Kilata and were now climbing ‘Mirinae’, the mountain of fog. The magic fog grew thicker with each step and even I couldn’t see what was ahead now.</p>
<p>With my gaze fixed to the front, I asked, “Harin-ssi, what should we look out for on this mountain?”</p>
<p>“…We need to look out for people.”</p>
<p>“People?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Harin nodded in all seriousness.</p>
<p>As a side note, she had already confessed her true identity—that she was ‘Harin’, the eldest daughter of the Leon clan—back when she told us about Krisbell.</p>
<p>“Mount Mirinae is special because of the magic fog that surrounds it. The fog that blocks climbers’ view also increases the density of magic power in the air. This makes Mirinae the perfect place for training,” walking by my side, Harin continued, “For that reason, this place is crawling with reclusive experts, martial artists who seek to become stronger, and criminals who are on the run from the Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>Her explanation made sense. This mountain was similar to the Himalayas in my setting.</p>
<p>“I understand. For now, let’s keep moving until we find a place to rest.”</p>
<p>I walked cautiously. The farthest I could see now was 100 meters ahead.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge rock appeared in front of us.</p>
<p>The oddly shaped rock was about 30 meters tall.</p>
<p>It was blocking our path completely, and beyond it was a cliff.</p>
<p>I stopped Boss and Harin.</p>
<p>“I think I’m lost.”</p>
<p>“…? You, Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>Boss seemed surprised, but I was quick to admit my mistake.</p>
<p>“Yes. This fog is too thick even for me. There’s a rock up ahead…?”</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, magic power poured out from the rock, and the fog disappeared from the area surrounding it. Now we could see the mountain view clearly. At the same time, we heard a heavy voice.</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>The voice was full of magic power.</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to the top of the rock.</p>
<p>There, a woman was sitting cross-legged with her hands on her knees.</p>
<p>“I asked you a question, you dimwit. Answer me.”</p>
<p>Her long hair was messy and her coat was completely worn out, but the magic power that she was emitting was second to none.</p>
<p>Her voice was wrapped in overflowing magic power. I noticed that Harin had completely froze.</p>
<p>Harin whispered in a daze, “…Shimurin.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>The woman raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Look at you. So you’ve heard of me, huh?”</p>
<p><em>Gulp—</em> Harin swallowed hard and replied, “There’s not a person in this world who doesn’t know you.”</p>
<p>“Mm? Well, I guess that makes sense.”</p>
<p>With a smirk, the woman raised herself to her feet. Even considering the fact that I was looking up at her, she was quite tall.</p>
<p>Harin whispered to us, “That’s Shimurin, the grand magician.”</p>
<p>“…Grand magician?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she’s a magician who used to be active in the Kingdom. But she’s been led astray by her genius and got involved in a strange research….”</p>
<p>“What are you whispering about?”</p>
<p>The grand magician Shimurin looked down at us with vicious eyes.</p>
<p>“Do you really have the time to talk? I could swallow you alive right this minute.”</p>
<p>It was then that a system window popped up before me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Quest]</p>
<p>[Level of difficulty — Highest]</p>
<p>[Summary — ‘Shimurin’ is a magician who studies interdimensional migration. Disillusioned with the secular society, she took refuge on Mount Mirinae. She abhors humans.]</p>
<p>[Goal — Persuade Shimurin to come to the Republic OR survive Shimurin.]</p>
<p>[Reward — Your ‘Aether’ armor]</p>
<p>[Failure result — Probably death]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Level of difficulty— ‘highest’.</p>
<p>Failure result — ‘death’.</p>
<p>Stunned, I turned my gaze to Boss.</p>
<p>Her eyes were also wandering through the air. It appeared she had also received the same quest as me.</p>
<p>“Boss… did you also get a quest?”</p>
<p>“…Mm? Ah.”</p>
<p>I asked carefully, and…</p>
<p>“I did. It says that the level of difficulty is ‘highest.’”</p>
<p>…Boss slowly nodded.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[‘Arun’, the royal palace of Arunheim — VIP room]</p>
<p>The dim light from the crescent moon shone down on the darkness below. In the middle of the night, at the terrace where the leaves trembled in the breeze and the owls cried mournfully, Jin Sahyuk was deep in thought.</p>
<p>She was thinking about Bell, Kim Suho, Kim Hajin, and herself.</p>
<p>‘The end is near….’</p>
<p>That was what Bell had said. She, however, had no idea what Bell’s end would look like. She couldn’t even say with confidence that Bell would keep his promise. All the uncertainties left her confused, but they were not what she was most concerned about at the moment.</p>
<p>“…Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>Bell told her that Kindspring was Kim Hajin, that everything was a mistake born of the distortion of time and space.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk believed this unbelievable fact as she had already witnessed [Synchronization] with her own eyes. She had seen the emotions Kindspring harbored for her inside Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>With a sigh, Jin Sahyuk turned her gaze to the endless darkness ahead.</p>
<p>Cold breeze disheveled her hair. Her royal beauty shone brightly even in the darkness.</p>
<p>Thinking of Kim Hajin, who was imprinted on her brain, and Kindspring, who left a scar in her heart, she came to a decision.</p>
<p>“…If I can go back,”</p>
<p>If she could go back to her kingdom, to the world full of her mistakes, sorrow, pride, agony, love, and regret—</p>
<p>“I’m bringing you with me.”</p>
<p>The synchronization rate referred to the extent to which Kim Hajin was one with Kindspring.</p>
<p>She was confident that the rate would rise drastically if Kim Hajin lived in her kingdom, in <em>their</em> world….</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>With a small sigh, Jin Sahyuk looked down at the invitation on the table.</p>
<p>[Arunheim Nobles’ Gathering]</p>
<p>It was an invitation to a social gathering that Bell had strongly advised her to attend.</p>
<p>She usually loathed the hypocrisy peculiar to the nobility. However…</p>
<p>“…I guess I should at least grant his dying wish,” Jin Sahyuk muttered as she stuffed the invitation in her pocket.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 323. Break-Even Point (2)</p>
<p>[Mirinae Mountain]</p>
<p>The grand magician brought us to her home. It looked no different than a prehistoric hut on the outside, but the inside was far bigger than what we imagined, having enough space to fit twenty-two soccer fields. Shimurin locked us in here and went outside.</p>
<p>“Shimurin was famous as Arunheim’s grand magician.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Harin began to explain Shimurin’s background.</p>
<p>“She became an official magician when she was 8, became a grand magician at the age of 18, and reached the highest realm in history at 28. She was titled ‘The One Closest to the Truth.’”</p>
<p>Harin looked around Shimurin’s abode and continued.</p>
<p>“But 10 years ago, on the year she became 30, she left the kingdom. She disappeared completely. Her juniors reported her saying that she wanted to ‘leave this world’ before disappearing. That’s why the world thought she committed suicide.”</p>
<p>“…But in reality, she’s been hiding here the whole time.”</p>
<p>Harin nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, though I don’t know why.”</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>I checked the quest summary once more.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Quest]</p>
<p>[Level of difficulty — Highest]</p>
<p>[Summary — ‘Shimurin’ is a magician who studies interdimensional migration. Disillusioned with the secular society, she took refuge in Mount Mirinae. She abhors humans.]</p>
<p>[Goal — Persuade Shimurin to come to the Republic OR survive Shimurin.]</p>
<p>[Reward — Your ‘Aether’ armor]</p>
<p>[Failure result — Probably death]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The summary said she was studying interdimensional migration. Her coming here probably had something to do with it.</p>
<p>“To think Shimurin was in Mount Mirinae this entire time… I’m surprised no one noticed all these years.”</p>
<p>“…I’m sure she’s killed everyone who did.”</p>
<p>I said with a shrug, and Harin raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“No one noticed because she killed everyone who saw her. She said it herself when we first met. That she could eat us alive.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Harin’s face froze. But soon, she smiled forcibly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“No way, a grand magician would never—”</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Shimurin returned with a gust of wind. Harin froze immediately.</p>
<p>I stared at Shimurin and saw a book in her hand.</p>
<p>According to Observation and Reading, the book was called [Shimurin’s Magic Book] and contained Shimurin’s research into magic.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Shimurin began to murmur a spell. Her magic power seeped into the book, while Boss instinctively used Shadow Barrier, covering just me and herself.</p>
<p>“W-Wait, what about me—”</p>
<p>While Harin muttered in a fluster, I thought about what to do. The answer was easy. After all, the quest window showed what Shimurin wanted.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and shouted.</p>
<p>“Are you studying dimensional travel?”</p>
<p>Shimurin’s expression immediately stiffened.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Republic of Leores — Underground Prison]</p>
<p>Kim Suho was locked up in a prison. After receiving Chae Nayun’s message, Kim Suho ran to find Seraine, throwing open her door hastily. Seraine screamed and fell, and the knights guarding her had arrested him.</p>
<p>“…Geez, couldn’t you have knocked? You were almost executed for an attempted assassination, you know?”</p>
<p>Thanks to Seraine, he didn’t have to suffer any harsh treatment. Currently, Seraine was staring at him with a dumbfounded look.</p>
<p>Kim Suho said to Seraine from behind bars, “Seraine-ssi, my friend will come here soon with the Loren Clan’s eldest daughter.”</p>
<p>“Then we’ll let Arunheim Kingdom know. That their wanted criminal is in Leores.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Kim Suho clenched his teeth. He looked genuinely angry, and Seraine had to take a step back.</p>
<p>‘I guess I shouldn’t have made that joke.’ Seraine let out a few dry coughs and then nodded her head.</p>
<p>“…Anyways, even if we don’t contact the Arunheim Kingdom, we can’t let her cross the border.”</p>
<p>But Kim Suho refused to give up, “They will be valuable allies.”</p>
<p>“I know that the Loren Clan’s eldest daughter is a powerful knight. I’m sure she has the potential to rise to a high position within Leores. But—”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not talking about Loren’s eldest daughter.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?” Seraine tilted her head in confusion.</p>
<p>Kim Suho spoke with trust and faith in a certain someone, “My friend, who is bringing Loren’s eldest daughter to this place, can stop the war by himself.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You’ll know when you see him.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was well-aware from experience that bullets were far scarier in war than arrows. Kim Hajin could kill a hundred soldiers with a single bullet, which was enough to overturn any battle.</p>
<p>“…But.”</p>
<p>“Lady, don’t listen to him. He’s only here because of his connections.”</p>
<p>Lekendol said as he approached Seraine. But Kim Suho didn’t give up and stared into Seraine’s eyes, and after meeting his gaze for a long time, Seraine had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p>“Whew… fine.”</p>
<p>In truth, what Kim Suho said last won her over.</p>
<p>A man who can stop the war by himself. As someone who had a deep interest in martial arts, she wanted to know what man the sword commander would have such high praises for.</p>
<p>“…I’ll talk to Father and try to deploy a squad secretly. But make sure no one finds out. Otherwise, we will both be killed.”</p>
<p>“Thank you—”</p>
<p>“There’s one more thing.”</p>
<p>Seraine held up her index finger.</p>
<p>“Even if they arrive safely, we’ll test their skills, especially the man you speak of. They’ll have to prove they’re worth the danger we’re putting ourselves in. As for the method…”</p>
<p>Seraine pointed at Lekendol.</p>
<p>“Lekendol will do it.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Lekendol smiled with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Kim Suho let out a sigh of relief, “…Yes, I understand. Let’s do that.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked relieved. He trusted that Kim Hajin would succeed no matter what.</p>
<p>“Good… Okay, we’ll let you out now.”</p>
<p>Seraine eyed Lekendol, and Lekendol promptly opened the cell with a key he brought.</p>

<p>[Arunheim]</p>
<p>A gathering of nobles, Arun Summit, took place before matters of national emergency. In this long tradition of Arunheim Kingdom, all reputable nobles came together at the royal palace to discuss.</p>
<p>“I detested the Republic of Leores at this time.”</p>
<p>On this important day, Prince Krisbell was with Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk seemed to be thinking with her eyes closed, and Bell continued talking as he stared out the window.</p>
<p>“Because the Republic killed someone I loved.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk replied, “Didn’t you say you went back in time to see this person again?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, so I saw her for another six years. She died when she was 20 in the original timeline but died at 26 in the second. It’s almost like death is set by fate. Someone who is fated to die early will die early and won’t live past 30, and someone who is fated to die late will live past 70 at the earliest. Funny, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Bell smiled. But it quickly disappeared and was replaced by a cold voice.</p>
<p>“Anyways, in a month, there will be a transnational peace conference in the Republic of Leores. Representatives from every nation in the world will gather to discuss the spreading Demon Realm Transformation. That’s where I summoned Baal.”</p>
<p>Bell closed his eyes and reminisced the past. The peace conference had transformed into hell at the descent of Baal. After materializing at the heart of the continent, Baal destroyed the world in just four days.</p>
<p>“…So I want you to change that future, Sahyuk. Release me from that fate with death.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t answer and simply stared at the room’s door. Just now, she felt a presence in front of it.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned to Bell and asked, “Did you call someone?”</p>
<p>“…Hm? Oh, is he already here?”</p>
<p>Bell grinned and raised his body. He walked to the door and opened it.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>Standing beyond the door was a nicely dressed Shin Jonghak. When Jin Sahyuk saw him, she scowled immediately.</p>
<p>“Shin Jonghak?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak also noticed Jin Sahyuk and instantly put on a similar face.</p>
<p>“What… crazy bitch, why are you here? Prince, this woman might look pretty, but she’s a psychopath. I’ll hold her back, please escape.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak said as he looked back and forth between Jin Sahyuk and Bell. On the other hand, Jin Sahyuk glared at Bell, not Shin Jonghak. She was demanding an explanation.</p>
<p>Bell shrugged his shoulders. “Characters mentioned multiple times are bound to appear again.”</p>
<p>“What bullshit is that?”</p>
<p>“Bullshit? You’re speaking to the Prince! I see you have no manners in this world either.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak muttered while pointing his finger at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you saying? Don’t you know who this is?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk pointed at Bell. Hearing this, Shin Jonghak observed Bell closely. He should have seen Bell’s face during the Orden Assassination Mission… but he didn’t recognize Bell’s changed appearance and went back to glaring at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Shut up—”</p>
<p>“Alright, now that Shin Myungchul’s grandson is here, why don’t we start the real talk.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>In that instant, Shin Jonghak paused. The name, Shin Myungchul, struck him like cold water.</p>
<p>“…Wait, you….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak finally recognized Bell, who put on a peaceful expression.</p>
<p>“Take a seat. You’re part of the story I’m about to tell.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak frowned. He glared at Bell and didn’t sit. He acted as though that was the last thing he wanted to do.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Bell added another sentence.</p>
<p>“Listen up. This is a story about me and your grandfather… a story about Returners.”</p>
<p>With that, Bell took out a crystal ball and threw it. The ball rolled over to Shin Jonghak’s feet.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak looked down and stared at the crystal ball.</p>
<p>Inside was the face of a young Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Mount Mirinae]</p>
<p>“…What did you do?”</p>
<p>Harin whispered at me as she sent a side-glance at Shimurin.</p>
<p>Shimurin was currently leading us somewhere. Harin seemed to be wondering what I did.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say we came to a mutual understanding.”</p>
<p>I replied with a shrug.</p>
<p>“Mutual understanding?”</p>
<p>“It’s a bit hard to explain.”</p>
<p>When I mentioned dimensional travel 30 minutes ago, Shimurin chased Boss and Harin away to talk with me alone.</p>
<p>First, she asked how I knew about her topic of research.</p>
<p>I answered truthfully, that I came to this world from another dimension.</p>
<p>Shimurin asked for proof. None of the other earthlings would have been able to give proof, but I could since I had Stigma’s magic power.</p>
<p>As a grand magician, Shimurin could feel the inexplicable power contained within Stigma’s magic power. I then utilized Stigma’s magic power to show a projection of the world I came from.</p>
<p>After that, the negotiation was a piece of cake.</p>
<p>“Tell me. What mutual understanding did—”</p>
<p>“Damn it, guys?” At that moment, Shimurin turned around cursing.</p>
<p>Harin, who was about to ask me something, froze in place.</p>
<p>However, what Shimurin said next made the fear within her disappear. “Do we have to keep walking?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?” Harin tilted her head.</p>
<p>Shimurin unleashed her magic power as though she was heavily bothered by all the walking.</p>
<p>“I’m talking about Teleport. Why can’t we use something like it?”</p>
<p>“…N-No, we can. Of course, we can. Why wouldn’t we be able to?” Harin nodded her head fiercely and encouraged Shimurin.</p>
<p>Teleport, an instantaneous method to get out of this mountain range. If it was possible, Harin wouldn’t hesitate to beg on her knees to use it.</p>
<p>“I can? Good, then I’m gonna use it. Is that okay?” Shimurin turned to me and asked.</p>
<p>I nodded my head, and Shimurin’s magic circle immediately enveloped us.</p>
<p>“—”</p>
<p>Shimurin muttered a strange chant only she could understand. The magic circle activated, and Shimurin’s teleportation magic enveloped our bodies.</p>
<p><em>Woong—</em></p>
<p>The world seemed to twist, and a floating sensation spread through my body.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, and soon, my feet touched the ground. I didn’t feel nauseous and wasn’t in pain. It was a perfect teleportation spell.</p>
<p>“You can open your eyes, scaredy cats.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Everyone opened their eyes.</p>
<p>“…Wow.”</p>
<p>An exclamation of awe left my mouth. The mountain fog was nowhere to be seen, and Leores’s buildings were spread out before our eyes. A city resembling modern England. In just three seconds, we had crossed several hundred kilometers.</p>
<p>“Let’s see… HJ?”</p>
<p>Shimurin said, pointing at me.</p>
<p>“Huh? Me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you. Follow me. We’re going to my workshop. You didn’t forget our promise, did you?”</p>
<p>“…Ah, yeah, sure. By the way, it’s Hajin, not HJ.”</p>
<p>“Your name doesn’t matter. I just need your magic power.”</p>
<p>Shimurin began to march forward.</p>
<p>“Um, grand magician-nim, what do you mean by workshop? You have something like that here?” Harin asked as she chased after Shimurin.</p>
<p>Shimurin nodded her head, “Yeah, it’s easy to get a fake identity in the Republic. This country doesn’t have a damned caste system.” Shimurin scowled as she said that final line.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 324. Break-Even Point (3)</p>
<p>Through teleport, we arrived at ‘Thaines’, a small port city in the Republic of Leores. Shimurin guided us to her workshop.</p>
<p>Shimurin’s workshop was located near the coast. On the outside, the workshop appeared to be a huge mansion, like a vacation home owned by a millionaire.</p>
<p>The mansion stood close to the ocean, and the gentle ocean breeze brushed past my ears.</p>
<p>“This way.”</p>
<p>Shimurin deactivated some simple security magic and opened the door. We slowly entered the workshop.</p>
<p>The inside of the workshop looked just as fancy as the outside.</p>
<p>“So this is where you’ve been all these years… in the middle of a city…?” Harin muttered.</p>
<p>With a snicker, Shimurin answered, “Just because I’m a magician, doesn’t mean I have to live in isolation. I only go to Mirinae when I have to meditate or gather materials for my research.”</p>
<p>Shimurin deactivated her transformation. Because she hadn’t taken a shower for a long time, she was filthy and covered in dirt. It only took her 3 seconds to become clean again, however, through a simple ‘cleanse’ magic.</p>
<p>“You must be tired from all that climbing. Pick any room you want and rest. Oh, you can go out and explore the city if you want. Except, you.”</p>
<p>Shimurin pointed at me.</p>
<p>“Hejin, you will follow me to the basement.”</p>
<p>Boss frowned next to me but I simply nodded.</p>
<p>“Hajin. I don’t sense any hostility but be careful. It’s hard to figure out what she’s thinking.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll be fine. Go rest, Boss.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I dismissed Boss’s concern with a smile and followed Shimurin down to the basement.</p>
<p>The basement of the mansion looked more like a typical workshop. There were magic circles everywhere. On her desk was a mountain of scrolls, and strange plants were growing in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>“Is this where you’ve been studying dimensional travel?” I asked casually.</p>
<p>Shimurin suddenly stopped in the center of the workshop and turned around.</p>
<p>She was frowning, and her gaze was as sharp as a blade.</p>
<p>“Oi.”</p>
<p>“…Yes?”</p>
<p>Her voice felt heavy. Overwhelmed by her aura, I backed away.</p>
<p>With a big frown and a piercing glare, Shimurin announced, “I don’t care how you found out about my research.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, magic power flowed out of Shimurin’s body.</p>
<p>“Your strange magic power is no proof that you’re from another dimension. Anyone can create illusions through magic power.”</p>
<p>Her enormous magic power pushed down on me heavily.</p>
<p>It was a bone-crushing, flesh-ripping kind of pressure.</p>
<p>Breathing became harder and I felt as if my organs were twisting inside me.</p>
<p>“The reason I’m still interested in you is this.”</p>
<p>But in the next moment, the pressure disappeared, and I fell to the floor, desperately gasping for air.</p>
<p>“…Because your magic power is close to the ‘truth’.”</p>
<p>I looked up at Shimurin.</p>
<p>Shimurin's gaze was looking through me.</p>
<p>“The pure magic power flowing through that strange scar on your arm…”</p>
<p>Her gaze traveled to my right arm. Shimurin’s magic power had ripped my clothes apart and the Stigma was completely visible.</p>
<p>Staring at the scar-like tattoo, Shimurin continued, “Truth, origin, essence… your magic power contains everything. That’s why I think your magic power could be the key to my grand magic.”</p>
<p>As she finished her speech, Shimurin turned on the lights in the workshop. Under the bright light, I saw a staircase leading deeper below the basement. Shimurin began walking down those stairs.</p>
<p>I asked her, “…Should I go with you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Shimurin stopped and scanned me from head to toe.</p>
<p>“You’re already surrounded in my magic. Rest, and I’ll summon you when I’m ready….”</p>
<p>After the somewhat spooky declaration, Shimurin continued her descent.</p>
<p>It was then that a bunch of system windows blocked my view.</p>
<p>[You have completed a high level quest.]</p>
<p>[You have completed a highest level quest.]</p>
<p>Along with messages informing me of the completion of the quests, I received all of my equipment at once. [Aether], [Desert Eagle], even the complete set of [Black Lotus Uniform], as well as my boxes of bullets including the god-slaying bullet.</p>
<p>“I’ve missed you guys so much….”</p>
<p>Words could not express the joy I was feeling at this moment.</p>
<p>‘Welcome home, my dear friends….’</p>
<p>I armed myself with Aether, the Black Lotus Uniform, and everything else. Then I sent Chae Nayun a message.</p>
<p>[Tell Kim Suho that we arrived at the Republic. We’re in ‘Thaines’.]</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Arunheim — residence of the prince]</p>
<p>The late afternoon sky was lit up with the blazing red of the setting sun.</p>
<p>Inside the prince’s room, which was so spacious that it almost felt empty, Jin Sahyuk muttered in a daze, “…He just left.”</p>
<p>“Haha. Yeah, he did.” Bell shrugged.</p>
<p>He and Jin Sahyuk were alone in this room.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak stomped out of the room as soon as Bell mentioned Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>“Is it okay to let him go?” Jin Sahyuk asked nonchalantly.</p>
<p>For someone as arrogant as him to run away without giving any excuse— Jin Sahyuk hadn’t expected this.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I thought this might happen,” Bell answered.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s beliefs and values were based on Shin Myungchul. Shin Jonghak would continue to evade any discussion of Shin Myungchul, because he’s too afraid to doubt his beliefs.</p>
<p>“…I’m curious. Can’t you just tell me?” Jin Sahyuk muttered.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul was a legend known by everyone. His fame aroused her interest.</p>
<p>Bell gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“About Shin Myungchul?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul had accomplished a lot in life.</p>
<p>He recaptured Seoul with Chae Joochul, drove many Djinns out of the Korean Peninsula, established the ‘Hero Association’ with his colleagues, founded the ‘Jinsung’ Group and saved millions of lives at the expense of his own.</p>
<p>Another name for Shin Myungchul was One True Hero.</p>
<p>He was the living embodiment of virtue, referred by many as the last hope of humanity.</p>
<p>“He and I were similar.”</p>
<p>Bell, however, knew everything about Shin Myungchul, including his past life.</p>
<p>“…Similar?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk couldn’t make sense of Bell’s words.</p>
<p>How could Bell, who she knew was trash before, and Shin Myungchul, a respectable hero, be similar?</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, Bell recalled Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>He recalled their first encounter.</p>
<p>Long, long ago.</p>
<p>Bell had warned Shin Myungchul about the Regression Stone, that it was a cursed stone that lured in devils, that the Ghost of Regression, ‘Baal’, would most definitely destroy him and his world in return for him going back in time.</p>
<p>But, as everyone knew, love could easily blind a person.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul readily sold his soul and the world he lived in to the devil for a chance to meet the person he loved once again.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” Jin Sahyuk responded nonchalantly.</p>
<p>“You don’t sound very surprised. That’s the truth about the legendary hero, Shin Myungchul.”</p>
<p>“I’m more interested in Baal. Just what is he?”</p>
<p>To this, Bell simply announced, “He’s just a pervert who likes to collect different worlds.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You know, some people collect books, figurines, things of that sort. Baal’s the same. He collects worlds for pleasure.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk felt anger boiling inside her as she listened to Bell.</p>
<p>She clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>“Then-”</p>
<p>“For your information, Baal didn’t meddle with your world. Akatrina was purely a self-inflicted downfall.”</p>
<p>Bell answered Jin Sahyuk’s question before she even said it out loud. Slightly embarrassed, Jin Sahyuk let out a dry cough and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“I-I wasn’t gonna ask. That’s not what I was…. So, what’s the Demon Realm Gate, then?”</p>
<p>“This place? This place is just a ‘condition’.”</p>
<p>“Condition?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s sort of like a contract. You know, because a great force requires an equally great restraint. Kind of like Newton’s third law.”</p>
<p>Baal’s existence transcended reality. In order for Baal to descend, he had to first go through a proper process.</p>
<p>“The Demon Realm Gate is not an ordeal given to men by Baal.”</p>
<p>Baal chose the ‘Demon Realm Gate’ as the solution.</p>
<p>“It’s an ordeal Baal placed on himself to descend.”</p>
<p>To reenact the first world he descended in in the form of the ‘Demon Realm Gate’ and use that as a medium to transfer himself to another dimension— this was the method Baal chose to descend to Earth.</p>
<p>“So, if you can stop Baal in this world, Baal won’t be able to descend to Earth.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk did not say a word. She stared at Bell in silence. Bell, too, stared back at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Their staring contest lasted for quite a while.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Downtown Thaines]</p>
<p>I went downtown with Harin and Boss. The ocean breeze blew gently in the bustling harbor city.</p>
<p>We toured the place, enjoying food vendors and shops. There was something refreshing about seeing a world I didn’t create myself.</p>
<p>“Hajin.”</p>
<p>While I was examining scrolls being sold at a magic shop, Boss called me.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Look at that.”</p>
<p>Boss pointed at a stall.</p>
<p>[Stuffed Dolls. Starting from just 8 Shillings.]</p>
<p>It was a shop selling dolls. Boss was looking at a stuffed bear in particular.</p>
<p>“Do you like bears, Boss? I guess that explains why you liked that bear helmet so much.”</p>
<p>“No, I wouldn’t say that… Do you have money?”</p>
<p>She asked like a delinquent.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I do.”</p>
<p>With a grin, I gave her a gold coin. It was part of the money I got to escort Harin.</p>
<p>“Mn, thanks.”</p>
<p>Boss walked up to the stall and picked up the stuffed bear. But it seemed one wasn’t enough, as she picked up a stuffed cat with her other hand.</p>
<p>I watched her with a smile before turning my gaze to another stall.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>Robed men suddenly appeared and surrounded me. Their bodies were huge, as though they were fully armored underneath their robes, and they each had a sharp sword hanging on their belt.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The assassins from Arunheim were already here?</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>Boss quickly returned to me, emanating her magic power. I also took out the Desert Eagle.</p>
<p>At that moment, the man, who seemed to be the leader, said in a respectful tone.</p>
<p>“…Kim Hajin-ssi, correct? We’ve come to pick you up under the order of Sword Commander Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Republic of Leores - Basement of Seraine’s Mansion]</p>
<p>Seraine received a message from Kim Suho that Harin and her companions had arrived in Thaines.</p>
<p>She was surprised that they were able to enter the Republic without being noticed by the border guards, but in any case, she ordered her knights to summon them.</p>
<p>“According to our investigation, he is an F-rank sharpshooter from Lorenzio Duchy.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>However, the Republic’s investigation only showed that the man highly praised by the sword commander was an F-rank sharpshooter.</p>
<p>“There’s no way… Perhaps he’s staying at F-rank on purpose?”</p>
<p>“Potentially. He is a rookie who only joined the army one year ago.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seraine fell silent and turned to look at the man inside the glass prison. It seemed he didn’t know he was in a prison cell, as he was yawning nonchalantly in his chair.</p>
<p>“What about the others?”</p>
<p>“We’ve confirmed the identity of Loren Clan’s daughter, but the other one cannot be identified. There’s no record of her whatsoever.”</p>
<p>“Hm….”</p>
<p>Seraine furrowed her brows and rubbed her chin.</p>
<p>An F-rank sharpshooter stopping the war by himself? It was the funniest joke she’s heard.</p>
<p>She didn’t believe that this sharpshooter was hiding his strength either. He looked dumb, and she couldn’t feel any magic power from him either. All powerful beings leaked magic power. Not even Kim Suho could prevent it.</p>
<p>‘Does Lekendol even need to test him? …Did Sword Commander lie?”</p>
<p>Just as Seraine was judging Kim Hajin…</p>
<p><em>KWANG-!</em></p>
<p>The basement door burst open, and a knight shouted urgently.</p>
<p>“Lady, a Monster Pathway has opened in the capital!”</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>Seraine immediately scowled. The knights guarding Kim Hajin ran out immediately, and Seraine was left staring at Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>‘He looks like an ordinary F-rank soldier no matter how much I observe him. It would be fine to leave him here alone, right? No, but what if Father finds out?’</p>
<p><em>Koong- Koong- Koong-</em></p>
<p>“Kyak!”</p>
<p>At that moment, the man inside the glass prison began to knock on the glass wall.</p>
<p>“Geez, you surprised me… What is it?!”</p>
<p>Seraine jumped in surprise and then realized that the man was saying something.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>She walked up to the wall with a frown. Seeing the man’s mouth from a closer distance, she could make out what he was saying.</p>
<p>—If they’re ordinary monsters…</p>
<p>—No matter how many there are…</p>
<p>—I can take care of them…</p>
<p>—Alone…</p>
<p>“What is he saying…?”</p>
<p>Just as Seraine murmured, the man held up a strange machine. It was the Desert Eagle, which only looked like a lump of metal in Seraine’s eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Seraine asked.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin grinned and replied.</p>
<p>—A weapon specialized for slaughter.</p>
<p>“…Slaughter?”</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>Simultaneously, a large ringing sound rang out. An artificial earthquake erupted, and a large hole appeared in the ground.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa….</em></p>
<p>Strange noises rang out from the hole. It was a mix of monsters’ cries.</p>
<p>A long time had passed since a ‘Monster Pathway’ was created so close to the capital.</p>
<p>Seraine clenched her teeth and pulled out her sword.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Then, she looked at Kim Hajin. He was staring at her like an innocent child, knocking on the glass wall.</p>
<p>When their eyes met, Kim Hajin spoke.</p>
<p>—Let me out.</p>
<p>He looked too relaxed.</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAA—!</em></p>
<p>The cries of monsters became louder.</p>
<p><em>Koong, Koong, Koong.</em></p>
<p>And the man inside the glass prison urged her continuously.</p>
<p>—Just let me out. I’ll take care of them for you.</p>
<p>Reading his mouth, Seraine’s frowned.</p>
<p>“Hmph, if you’re so confident, why don’t you just break out?!”</p>
<p>Though that’s what she said, Seraine pushed the button to open the prison.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>The door of the glass prison opened.</p>
<p>The man walked out leisurely. Staring at Seraine, he muttered arrogantly.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be charged for destruction of property.”</p>
<p>And at that moment…</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAA—!</em></p>
<p>Demonic monsters shot up from the hole in the ground.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 325. Transnational Peace Conference (1)</p>
<p>[Leores Sword Institution — Commander’s Office]</p>
<p>Kim Suho was pacing back and forth in his office.</p>
<p>He informed Seraine of Kim Hajin’s arrival as soon as he heard the news from Chae Nayun. He was still worried, however, about Seraine’s declaration that she would test Kim Hajin’s skills.</p>
<p>“…Why are you so worried? Kim Hajin knows how to take care of himself,” Aileen said. She was slouching in a chair in the corner of the office and yawning.</p>
<p>Kim Suho awkwardly scratched the back of his neck and sat in a chair.</p>
<p>“Will he be okay?”</p>
<p>“How should I know? But, as we all know, he’s not a kid.”</p>
<p><em>Mnnn~</em> This time, Aileen stretched.</p>
<p>“By the way, I found more people.”</p>
<p>“What? Really?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho widened his eyes.</p>
<p>With a smirk, Aileen answered, “Yup, 3 more. Rachel, Yoo Yeonha, Yi Jiyoon.”</p>
<p>“Wow!” Kim Suho exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>But then he remembered ‘her’ and his heart sank.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>He knew that she had also been dragged into this world.</p>
<p>Just where was she now?</p>
<p>“The three of them are running a business together in a local city.”</p>
<p>“…A business?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho tilted his head in confusion, and Aileen handed him a crumpled piece of paper. It was a document outlining Yoo Yeonha, Rachel, and Yi Jiyoon’s current status.</p>
<p>Kim Suho began reading the document in silence.</p>
<p>…As Aileen had said, Yoo Yeonha was indeed running a business in this world.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of a merchant. Her family had been running local businesses for generations. Rachel was Yoo Yeonha’s maid, and Yi Jiyoon was a local aristocrat.</p>
<p>“Looks like they’ve joined hands. Apparently they’re making tons of money.”</p>
<p>“…It’s hardly surprising. Yoo Yeonha is the kind of person to thrive anywhere.”</p>
<p>She'd even survive being dumped on an uninhabited island. Kim Suho put the document down with a smile.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had settled in ‘Lecor’, a provincial metropolis.</p>
<p>‘I should pay her a visit as soon as I finish taking care of the current matter regarding Kim Hajin…’ Kim Suho thought.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>—Emergency! Emergency! It’s a Monster Pathway!</p>
<p>The siren wailed through the speakers in the office.</p>
<p><em>Koong, Koong—!</em></p>
<p>Kim Suho immediately rose from his seat and ran out of the office.</p>
<p>“Ehew….”</p>
<p>Aileen sighed, then stretched and yawned once more before chasing Kim Suho.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[The basement of Seraine’s mansion]</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Seraine couldn’t believe her eyes, even though she was standing in the middle of everything.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>The gigantic hole on the surface of the ground. The flood of monsters traveling through the hole.</p>
<p>But neither was more unrealistic than the man who was extinguishing the monsters.</p>
<p><em>Tudududu…</em>.</p>
<p>The man was aiming a strange looking machine at the monsters. On the outside, his shooting seemed unruly. Surprisingly, however, his attack knocked the monsters out one by one with stunning precision.</p>
<p>There was no exception.</p>
<p>Monsters that had been struck by the bullets died as their heads and hearts exploded. Every single bullet was more powerful than Seraine at her best.</p>
<p>“Wow, this is endless,” Kim Hajin muttered with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Was it because he hadn't shot for a while? Excitement and thrill made his heart race.</p>
<p>But he knew he shouldn’t waste bullets out of excitement. This was not Earth, and the supply of bullets was limited here.</p>
<p>And so, Kim Hajin took out the grenade he had ordered from Essential Armory. It was made using ‘Dimensional Entropy’.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin upgraded this grenade with [Bomber]—the Trait he earned from the Tower of Wish—as well as his Gift [Random Consolidation System] and a streak of [Stigma].</p>
<p>The grenade was only as big as a baseball.</p>
<p>Its impact, however, would exceed most bombs.</p>
<p><em>Roll—</em></p>
<p>Kim Hajin threw the grenade into the hole through which the monsters traveled.</p>
<p>Then he turned to Seraine and said, “Cover your ears.”</p>
<p>Seraine flinched and covered her ears as instructed.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>The grenade exploded immediately.</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>The giant explosion shook the ground, and white pillars of light shot out from the hole.</p>
<p>They were caused by the light attribute attached to the grenade.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Silence descended after the huge explosion.</p>
<p>Buried in a solemn stillness, Seraine ran her fingers through her hair.</p>
<p>“Keuk-”</p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt a severe headache coming.</p>
<p>‘What is this? What am I seeing?’</p>
<p>Her head was about to explode in confusion.</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>In comparison, Kim Hajin moved calmly and looked inside the hole.</p>
<p>Everything was completely wiped out as he expected. All the monsters had disappeared without a trace, dismantled by the light.</p>
<p>“This place is safe now.” He declared proudly and picked up the Desert Eagle, which was in the shape of a machine gun. He then asked, “Excuse me, Seraine-ssi, does this place have a rooftop?”</p>
<p>“…Rooftop?” Still dazed, Seraine swallowed her saliva and asked back.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin answered, “Yes. There’s more of them outside, right? I want to go to the rooftop and shoot all of them.”</p>
<p>“There… is.”</p>
<p>That was good enough confirmation for Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>He surrounded himself in Aether.</p>
<p>Aether and Parkour increased his physical abilities.</p>
<p>“I’ll go on ahead.”</p>
<p>He stepped on the walls and quickly climbed to the rooftop like a spider.</p>
<p>“That’s a lot.”</p>
<p>He looked down at the ground below from the windy rooftop.</p>
<p>Monsters that had escaped out into the world were raising a ruckus on the streets of the city.</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>He gave a small sigh and grabbed the machine gun.</p>
<p>With Thousand-Mile Eyes, he estimated the number of monsters to be roughly around 20,000.</p>
<p>This meant he had to kill at least 30 monsters with a single bullet.</p>
<p>“…Will it work?”</p>
<p>Because the power of his Gift had been reduced, he didn’t think that the speed and movement of his bullets would be as accurate as before.</p>
<p>But then again, these were just monsters.</p>
<p>He mounted Desert Eagle, now in the form of a machine gun, on his shoulder.</p>
<p>He then aimed at multiple targets simultaneously, calculated the trajectory of bullets, and pulled the trigger without hesitation.</p>
<p><em>Dudududu….</em></p>
<p>From the rooftop of the mansion— bullets began to rain.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[2 hours later, Leores Sword Institution]</p>
<p>I went down to the basement with Harin. Seraine, Kim Suho, and a number of knights were waiting for us there.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>Harin greeted them. Seraine looked at Harin in silence. Only when Kim Suho signaled her, did she finally nod.</p>
<p>“…Yes. Nice to meet you, Lord….”</p>
<p>Seraine stopped midway through the sentence.</p>
<p>No one here was supposed to know that Harin was a member of the Leon clan. The Leons had been officially annihilated.</p>
<p>“Harin-ssi.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for taking me in, Lord Seraine.”</p>
<p>Harin wasn’t offended by the way she had been called. In fact, she could bow down to Seraine for saving her life.</p>
<p>“Yes, and….”</p>
<p>Seraine turned to me. The way she looked at me was completely different from when we first met.</p>
<p>She, however, turned her gaze to Kim Suho without saying a word to me.</p>
<p>Seraine stared at Kim Suho for a while before finally opening her mouth.</p>
<p>“Seems like everything you say is true, Commander.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s expression brightened up.</p>
<p>His lips began to twitch. Unable to contain his joy, he put his hand over his mouth before bursting into laughter.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha. Didn’t I say so? So, how was my friend?”</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Seraine gave a small sigh. Then she took out a document.</p>
<p>“According to the statistics, the number of monsters that came out of the hole were 15912 low-intermediate ranks, 6534 intermediate-ranks, and 301 high-ranks. This was nothing short of a grand invasion. Originally, we would have suffered a serious loss in both life and property, and spent at least 3 days subjugating the enemies. However….”</p>
<p>Seraine stopped and looked at me. I knew by instinct that this was the right time for me to shrug.</p>
<p>“We brought everything under control in 2 hours. With the help of a mysterious weapon.”</p>
<p>“A weapon? You mean a person.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho quickly corrected her.</p>
<p>Seraine gave him a dirty look and nodded.</p>
<p>“Sure. With the help of a person.”</p>
<p>Seraine crossed her arms. She reminded me of Yoo Yeonha, except that she was much more sloppy and inexperienced. This thought made me smile.</p>
<p>“…Excuse me, what are you laughing at?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh, no, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Ssp… anyways,” Seraine pouted and asked, “How did you do it?”</p>
<p>“That’s….”</p>
<p>How should I explain?</p>
<p>‘One bullet killed at least 30 monsters. My bullets also serve as guided missiles. As long as the altitude is high enough, I can shoot just about anything. I still have more than 3,000 bullets left.'</p>
<p>“Regardless of the number, if the enemies are weak, I can kill them all with a pull of a finger…”</p>
<p>I condensed the complicated explanation into a very short but accurate sentence.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…30 minutes later.</p>
<p>I officially reunited with Kim Suho in the office of the sword commander. Harin left to speak with Seraine, and Boss returned to Shimurin’s mansion. We had to keep our relationship hidden from others, after all.</p>
<p>“I got this from a quest.”</p>
<p>[Summary of the Past and the Future to Come]</p>
<p>The first thing Kim Suho did was to hand me a book he received as a quest reward. It contained the summary of this world’s past and future.</p>
<p>“Can you see what’s written inside, Hajin?”</p>
<p>I opened the book.</p>
<p>But I saw nothing but blank plages.</p>
<p>“No, I can’t.”</p>
<p>"Ah. I guess I'm really the only one who can read it,” Kim Suho muttered regrettably and skipped to the last page, “This book ends with a description about the Transnational Peace Conference, which will be held in a month and a half.”</p>
<p>“Transnational Peace Conference?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. This is the last sentence of the book. [A grand calamity descended on the day of the Transnational Peace Conference].”</p>
<p>[A grand calamity descended on the day of the Transnational Peace Conference.]</p>
<p>I stroked my chin, deep in thought.</p>
<p>‘I’ll have to ask the Book of Truth about the conference once my Stigma is restored.’</p>
<p>“I think it’s clear that something’s going to happen at the Transnational Peace Conference,” said Kim Suho.</p>
<p>I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>“…I’ll look into it later,” I answered and turned my gaze to Kim Suho, “More importantly, did you find the others?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right. We found Yoo Yeonha, Rachel, and Yi Jiyoon.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>My lips curved into a smile.</p>
<p>I’ve been dying to meet them again— well, maybe not Yi Jiyoon, but definitely Yoo Yeonha and Rachel.</p>
<p>“Yeah. And they’re not far from here.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho beamed.</p>
<p>“Yeah? What have they been up to until now?”</p>
<p>“Business. Yoo Yeonha already has influence over a local metropolis.”</p>
<p>“Pfft. Really?”</p>
<p>I immediately burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“As expected of Yeonha, right?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked jokingly and I nodded.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Then… how about we go meet them right now?” suggested Kim Suho as he put on a coat.</p>
<p>I also straightened my clothes and raised myself from the chair.</p>
<p>“Good idea. You know the way, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you can count on me.”</p>
<p>We stood in front of the door of the office together.</p>
<p>Kim Suho grabbed the door knob but stopped as if he just remembered something.</p>
<p>“…Oh, before we leave,”</p>
<p>All of a sudden Kim Suho cast an affectionate look, and… pulled me by my arm.</p>
<p>“It’s good to see you again.”</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was in his arms. They were as big and sturdy as I remembered them.</p>
<p>“…What? O-Oh….”</p>
<p>“So good.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Um… sure. It’s good to see you, too.”</p>
<p>Confined(?) in Kim Suho’s arms, I patted Kim Suho on the back.</p>
<p><em>Tak, tak, tak.</em></p>
<p>Three times. It was to signal him to let me go.</p>
<p>It appeared that Kim Suho had mistaken my intention, however. He began squeezing me even harder….</p>
<p>“…<em>sniff, sniff</em>.”</p>
<p>As uncomfortable and awkward as it was, I couldn’t help but think that he smelled good.</p>
<p>This was probably a main character trait as well.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks to his fragrance, the hug wasn’t too bad.</p>
<p>Thinking so— I waited for Kim Suho to release me.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 326. Transnational Peace Conference (2)</p>
<p>[Megacity, Lecor]</p>
<p>In this megacity known as the second capital of Leores, Yoo Yeonha was fully utilizing her skills.</p>
<p>[Merchant Group – Lotus Flower]</p>
<p>The merchant group Yoo Yeonha’s clan owned, Lotus Flower. In a mere month, Yoo Yeonha had turned this small merchant group into the most famous group in the area. The people around her were critical in helping her achieve this.</p>
<p>First was Rachel. She was Yoo Yeonha’s slave… or servant, technically. The power of her elementals was amplified in this world as the world’s nature and mana were richer than Earth’s.</p>
<p>Rachel’s elementals had various uses, such as speeding up carts, slowing down easily decaying items, and collecting herbs automatically.</p>
<p>Next was Yi Jiyoon. She was the daughter of the Prin Clan, a renowned clan in the area. Although the caste system had been abolished in the Republic of Leores, the Prin Clan was recognized by the citizens as ‘nobles’.</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon invested her clan’s money to Yoo Yeonha’s merchant group and even let her borrow the clan’s name.</p>
<p>As the Prin Clan had a spotless reputation, Yoo Yeonha’s merchant group had no trouble earning the trust of others.</p>
<p>“Wow, the profit margin is even bigger than I thought….”</p>
<p>In the office of the Lotus Flower Merchant Group, Yi Jiyoon muttered in surprise as she stared at the group’s financial statement.</p>
<p>“What are you going to do with all this money?”</p>
<p>Hearing Yi Jiyoon’s question, Yoo Yeonha shrugged.</p>
<p>“First, establish a force. We don’t know what will happen from now.”</p>
<p>She did not forget that she was inside the Demon Realm Gate. She planned to have everything ready for the future, whether it be military force or money.</p>
<p>“Our Chief Officer sure is amazing~”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon snuggled up to Yoo Yeonha and praised her.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em> At that moment, someone knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Kuhum.” Yi Jiyoon let out a dry cough and put on a stern expression befitting a noble.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smirked and muttered, “Come in.”</p>
<p>The door opened. The guest was Rachel, who was holding a long, rod-like object wrapped in a red veil.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here, Rachel?” Yoo Yeonha welcomed her, and Rachel walked in with a smile and put down the item she brought.</p>
<p>“Oh, that must be that.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha unwrapped the item without hesitation. Inside was an ornamental sword emanating a clear aura.</p>
<p>“What’s this?” Yi Jiyoon asked.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha picked up the sword. The blade of the sword was entirely blue. This sword was a treasure Yoo Yeonha bought for Rachel.</p>
<p>“…Here, take it.” With a smile, Yoo Yeonha gave the sword to Rachel.</p>
<p>Rachel, who was standing quietly, widened her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“It’s a sword that apparently raises the power of elementals. Our world doesn’t have treasures like this since elementalists are so rare, but this world unexpectedly has many. This sword is named Wisp.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha put the sword in Rachel’s hands. Having received an unexpected present, Rachel dropped her head with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>It was then. <em>Kwang—!</em> The office door burst open, and a guard drenched in sweat came running in.</p>
<p>He shouted, “Demonic monsters! Demonic monsters appeared!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The moment the group heard the message, they ran out of the office.</p>
<p>They came out of the merchant group’s building and looked around. To their surprise, the city was too peaceful for demonic monsters to have invaded.</p>
<p>“Where are the demonic monsters?”</p>
<p>“I… don’t know.”</p>
<p>“It didn’t look like he was lying….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha, Rachel, and Yi Jiyoon each muttered. As the three of them were tilting their heads curiously, a robed man approached them.</p>
<p>“Demonic monsters~?”</p>
<p>With a familiar voice, the man stood next to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha furrowed her brows and stared at the man.</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“They were here, but not anymore.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Hearing the familiar voice, Yoo Yeonha bent down a bit and peaked under the man’s hood.</p>
<p>“…Ah!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha pointed her finger at the man and shouted, “You!”</p>
<p>The man, Kim Hajin, smiled.</p>
<p>“Yo, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why is Kim Hajin here?”</p>
<p>“Ha, Hajin-ssi?”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon and Rachel were also shocked and stared at Kim Hajin in a daze.</p>
<p>“I’m here too~”</p>
<p>A small child peeked her head out from Kim Hajin’s back.</p>
<p>The small child was, of course, the Spirit Speech Master, Aileen.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Priton Clan’s Castle]</p>
<p>The eldest son of Priton Clan, Shin Jonghak, was lying in his bed, sighing.</p>
<p>“That bastard….”</p>
<p>What the prince said lingered in his head.</p>
<p>“What does he know about Grandfather? And how?”</p>
<p>Anxiety and curiosity mixed together to form chaos.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>As Shin Jonghak was rumpling his hair in agony, someone knocked on his door.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak didn’t want to see anyone at the moment, but the knock was only a formality as a certain woman opened the door and walked in.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shin Jonghak.”</p>
<p>As expected, it was Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“…Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak let out a deep sigh and stared at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Currently, Chae Nayun had an antenna on her head.</p>
<p>A few days ago, she muttered, ‘wouldn’t this make communication faster~?’ and had an ahoge hairstyle every time she wanted to use Infinite Communication.</p>
<p>“Have you heard of the Transnational Peace Conference?”</p>
<p>“…Transitional Peace Conference?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak furrowed his brows at the sudden question.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“…I’ve heard of it. It’s exactly what it sounds like too.”</p>
<p>“When is it?”</p>
<p>“Next month. Why?”</p>
<p>“Ah~ Kim Suho says something will happen on that day. He told us to raise our strength in preparation for it.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun sat on the corner of the bed, while Shin Jonghak stared at her fixedly.</p>
<p>“…Kim Suho said that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, should I contact him again?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun closed her eyes and began to shake her body.</p>
<p><em>Brrr— Brrr— Brrr—</em></p>
<p>Her strange actions were nothing but cute in Shin Jonghak’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Haha.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t a special reason Shin Jonghak came to like Chae Nayun. Just looking at her melted away the dark emotions in his heart. How could he not fall for her?</p>
<p>“Chae Nayun.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun opened her eyes and stared at him.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak stared into her eyes and asked about the matter that had been bothering him.</p>
<p>“What do you think about Regressors?”</p>
<p>“…Regressors?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking about that all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“…Well, you’ve heard about my grandfather being a Regressor, right?”</p>
<p>In truth, Shin Myungchul being a Regressor was a rumor Shin Jonghak didn’t want to admit. In his mind, it diminished his achievements and sacrifice.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>After much thought, Chae Nayun recalled what she heard from Yoo Yeonha in the past.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha said that Kim Hajin was a Regressor. Of course, she repeatedly said it was only speculation… but Chae Nayun was still forced to think about the topic.</p>
<p>“Mm… well.”</p>
<p>The answer was simple.</p>
<p>“I’m jealous. I also want to go back in time.”</p>
<p>“…No, not that. Haha.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak laughed and shook his head.</p>
<p>‘It’s my fault for asking Chae Nayun’, he thought.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun frowned. “What? Aren’t you jealous? If there really are Regressors, I think that’s amazing. Think about it. It’s not like we’re in a novel. You would have to be incredibly lucky and powerful to have a chance of going back in time.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“That’s what I think, at least. And to that effect, who cares if your grandfather is a Regressor or not? Do people hate him because he’s rumored to be a Regressor? No. Everyone respects him. His name is written in practically every history textbook in the world, his biography is a best-seller, and there are statues of him everywhere. Why would you even worry about that?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>He simply stared at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>A smile that he couldn’t hold back broke out on his face.</p>
<p>“Pft… haa.”</p>
<p>With a low sigh, Shin Jonghak muttered, “This is why I love—”</p>
<p>“Oi.”</p>
<p>But Shin Jonghak’s confession was cut short. Someone had appeared outside his bedroom window.</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun quickly clad herself in qi reinforcement, and Shin Jonghak quickly grabbed his spear from the corner of his room. Only after preparing themselves for battle did they confirm who the intruder was.</p>
<p>“How are ya?”</p>
<p>It was Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>She was sitting on the windowsill, staring at Chae Nayun and Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“You wench… where do you think you are…”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun cursed and formed a sword with magic power.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said something completely unexpected.</p>
<p>“Let’s join forces.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Dumfounded, Shin Jonghak and Chae Nayun both stared at Jin Sahyuk frozenly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jin Sahyuk continued with a stern face, “There’s a crazy bastard named Yi Yeonjun we need to stop….”</p>
<p>“Hmph, as if we’ll believe you—!” Chae Nayun shouted.</p>
<p>But just as she was about to release her magic power, another figure leaped into the room and stopped her.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared at the man who suddenly appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>A giant, muscular body that was as strong as steel.</p>
<p>“Uhahaha, it’s been a while, brat.”</p>
<p>The cheerful voice undoubtedly belonged to Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Office of Merchant Group Lotus Flower]</p>
<p>After joining up with Yoo Yeonha, we began to discuss the upcoming Transnational Peace Conference.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what will happen exactly,” Kim Suho said. He was certain that a disaster would break out during the Transnational Peace Conference, but that was the extent of his knowledge.</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon asked, “Can’t we stop the conference itself?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s too late to cancel it. It took three years just to get all nations to agree on a date. Declaring that the conference is canceled would be no different than declaring war.”</p>
<p>As the sword commander, Kim Suho had a good idea about the politics of the world.</p>
<p>While focusing on the meeting, I glanced at Rachel, who was seated next to me. She was also staring at me. We both smiled.</p>
<p>“What are you two doing?”</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha caught us. She glared at us with narrowed eyes, then, <em>chak!</em>, suddenly clapped her hands.</p>
<p>“You can say hi later. Focus on the meeting for now. Kim Suho, are Nayun and Jonghak ready?” Yoo Yeonha asked Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Let me ask. Hold on, this thing has a small delay.” Kim Suho closed his eyes. After about two minutes, he nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, they said they’re ready. Hm…?”</p>
<p>But it seemed he received another message as Kim Suho tilted his head and stared into the air.</p>
<p>And, in the next moment…</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s expression froze.</p>
<p>“What? What happened?”</p>
<p>Aileen urged him.</p>
<p>Kim Suho clenched his teeth and murmured.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk and Cheok Jungyeong are with Chae Nayun.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Harbor City, Thaines]</p>
<p>On a late, full moon night.</p>
<p>I returned to Thaines, where Boss and Shimurin were staying. Since Boss must be feeling lonely, I was sure she would be happy to know that we found Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>But when I arrived at Shimurin’s workshop, I was caught off guard by a surprising sight.</p>
<p>“Right, that’s how you use magic power. Your ability is excellent, but your connection with magic power isn’t delicate enough. It’s because you’re using your Gift with your instincts rather than magic power.”</p>
<p>Boss didn’t look lonely at all. She didn’t even look bored.</p>
<p>“Imagine putting magic power into your shadow. Then it becomes magic. Magic isn’t anything special. Transforming magic power into the attribute you want, that’s what magic is.”</p>
<p>She was being tutored by Shimurin. Perhaps because of the grand magician’s teachings, Boss’s shadow was no longer black.</p>
<p>It was blue, like ice.</p>
<p>She had imbued an attribute into her shadow.</p>
<p>“Boss?”</p>
<p>I called her carefully. Boss, who was eagerly training, turned her head and faced me.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here, Hajin.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, I’m back.”</p>
<p>I replied in a daze, and Shimurin also looked at me. She blinked her eyes a few times, then she rubbed her finger under her nose.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re back early. My dimensional magic isn’t ready yet.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, well, there’s something I need to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>I approached them slowly and stood next to Boss.</p>
<p>Boss stared at me with the same expressionless face she always had.</p>
<p>“Boss, I—”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hajin.” Boss cut me off. Then, she said with a slight smile, “I met Jain.”</p>
<p>“Jain? Great! I found Cheok Jungyeong.”</p>
<p>“That’s Jain.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>I tilted my head. The Cheok Jungyeong I found was Jain?</p>
<p>“Jain is disguised as Cheok Jungyeong right now. You sent Gyeong to the Tower of Wish’s 9th floor, remember?”</p>
<p>“…Oh right.”</p>
<p>I finally realized what she meant. Indeed, I had sent Cheok Jungyeong to the 9th floor.</p>
<p>“Then you won’t be lonely once Jain comes.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Boss frowned a little.</p>
<p>“What? Who said I was lonely?”</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t laugh.”</p>
<p>Boss glared at me with a scowl, but it wasn’t scary at all.</p>
<p>I smiled like a kid and placed my hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hm. You two….” But at that moment, Shimurin looked back and forth between me and Boss and asked, “What’s your relationship?”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>We both tilted our heads at the sudden question.</p>
<p>“What’s your relationship? It doesn’t look like you’re just friends. Especially you.” Shimurin pointed at Boss and asked again.</p>
<p>Boss didn’t answer and simply looked up at me. She probably wanted to hear my answer.</p>
<p>Staring at her, I smiled.</p>
<p>I turned to Shimurin again and said what I wanted to say, “As I said, she’s my boss…. I like her a lot.”</p>
<p>At the same time, I imbued Stigma’s magic power into my eyes. My eyesight expanded, and I could observe Boss from the side.</p>
<p>Though she wasn’t aware of it herself, she was blushing noticeably.</p>
<p>“…Kuhum.”</p>
<p>She even coughed in embarrassment. She really couldn’t be cuter.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 327. Transnational Peace Conference (3)</p>
<p>I bought dinner ingredients at a grocery store near Shimurin’s workshop. I then used the recipe from a Michelin 3 star restaurant to cook broiled calves and dumplings.</p>
<p>The smell of delicious food began to spread throughout the mansion and Shimurin, who initially claimed to be uninterested, came to the table. Shimurin kept asking, “What’s this? What’s that?” as she popped a bit of every dish into her mouth. Eventually she sat down and ate with us.</p>
<p>“…Mm. <em>Gulp.</em> I see.”</p>
<p>Afraid that Shimurin would steal from her plate, Boss hurriedly swallowed the last dumpling and nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I had just finished explaining to Boss everything about the Transnational Peace Conference, my reunion with Yoo Yeonha, Rachel, and the others, and the fact that the last major event of my setting, Baal’s Descent, would take place at the Conference.</p>
<p>“Hmmm….”</p>
<p><em>Nom, nom</em></p>
<p>Chewing a mouthful of dumplings, Boss fell into deep thought.</p>
<p><em>Nom, nom</em></p>
<p>A lot must be crossing her mind right now.</p>
<p><em>Nom, nom</em></p>
<p>She’s probably thinking about Bell’s true identity, and his relationship with Yi Yeonjun and Baal….</p>
<p><em>Tak—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Shimurin put down the fork.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>Shimurin looked at us in turn, then gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“So, your claim that you’re from another world seems to be true. You know about this world’s future, and your magic power is clearly different from ours.”</p>
<p>Boss and I stared at Shimurin in silence.</p>
<p>Neither of us were surprised. We acknowledged the fact that Shimurin was far more knowledgeable than we could imagine. She was, after all, a grand magician.</p>
<p>I suddenly recalled ‘Oh Jaejin’, the Nine Stars member and a 10-star magician. I used Setting Intervention to make pills that could cure his Gift’s side-effect. He took it, then ran away with his wife.</p>
<p>Of course, that didn’t mean I could devalue everything Oh Jaejin had done for humanity. Still, I couldn’t help but feel somewhat disappointed about the fact that I had lost the help of someone who probably was as knowledgeable as Shimurin.</p>
<p>“So, how much time does this world have left? Is this world going to end soon?” Shimurin asked.</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment but soon nodded. I wouldn’t be able to fool her even if I tried. I decided it was a better bet to be honest and just ask for her help.</p>
<p>“Yes, probably.”</p>
<p>“…’Probably’. That’s a tricky word,” Shimurin muttered so as she rose from the chair.</p>
<p>“I said ‘probably’, because it can be stopped,” I remarked earnestly.</p>
<p>Still, Shimurin remained expressionless and glared at me with cold eyes.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter to me anyway. Didn’t I tell you that my goal is to migrate to another world?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>My heart sank.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t say anything.</p>
<p>This world had fallen long ago.</p>
<p>What I was seeing now was nothing more than Baal's reconstruction of the fallen world.</p>
<p>Dimensional Travel was naturally impossible, since Shimurin was, in the end, a mere reflection of the dead.</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>In the end, that was all I could say.</p>
<p>Shimurin stared at me for a long time, then turned and went down to the basement.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[The Capital of the Republic of Leores]</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>Seraine was roaming the streets of the capital. As the daughter of the President, she liked to study public sentiment up close from time to time. No one recognized her underneath her disguise.</p>
<p>So, she walked with confidence. The streets were full of men traveling in and out of tall brick buildings and women in antique coats. The city was as busy and vibrant as ever.</p>
<p>“Extra! Extra!”</p>
<p>It was then that she heard a boy shouting. He was handing out newspapers to the passersby.</p>
<p>Seraine widened her eyes. She had heard of this phenomenon before. Sometimes, when there’s a newsflash, newspaper companies would print extra copies of newspapers in the evening. She heard it happened sometimes, but this was her first time seeing it in person, and she was amazed.</p>
<p>“Come find out the truth about the monster massacre from 3 days ago~”</p>
<p>The boy shouted, and only then did the passersby finally show interest in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Seraine hesitated for a second before grabbing a copy herself.</p>
<p>She turned her gaze to the front page, and….</p>
<p>[Monster massacre from 3 days ago — The hero who wiped out monsters was an ‘F-rank sharpshooter from the Lorenzio Duchy?]</p>
<p>“…What the.”</p>
<p>Seraine opened her eyes wide and clenched her fists.</p>
<p>The article was about Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>She had gone through so much trouble to keep all of this strictly confidential. How did they find out about Kim Hajin?</p>
<p>[…Three days ago, the people of the Republic witnessed an unforeseen phenomenon. The fifth largest ‘Monster Pathway’ in history appeared in the Republic’s capital city.</p>
<p>However, damage was nonexistent, thanks to the mysterious hero.</p>
<p>At around 8:37 p.m., a rush of magic power gracefully descended from the roof of Lady Seraine’s mansion and wiped out all the monsters on the ground. 30,000 monsters were annihilated in just two hours.</p>
<p>As a result, President Zucri declared the complete subjugation of the pathway at about 11:29 p.m. He, however, declined to comment about the mysterious hero.</p>
<p>But the next day at 7:33 a.m., according to an anonymous source…]</p>
<p>“Dammit…!”</p>
<p>Seraine crumpled the newspaper. But she was too late. Already everyone in the street was reading this article.</p>
<p>—F-rank sharpshooter?</p>
<p>—Seriously? They’re joking, right?</p>
<p>—This is interesting. I’m gonna show it to my son.</p>
<p>The murmur of the people alarmed her.</p>
<p>This was beyond bad.</p>
<p>At this rate, it wouldn’t be long until Arunheim hears about Kim Hajin. He came here with the daughter of the Leon clan. And there was only a month left until the Transnational Peace Conference….</p>
<p><em>Bzzzz—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Seraine felt a vibration in her pocket. It came from her portable crystal which she used for long distance communication. Seraine took out the crystal in a hurry and picked up the call.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me.”</p>
<p>—Miss, we just received a message from Lorenzio. It’s Airun. She claims to be in charge of the military unit Kim Hajin belongs to. She wishes to speak to her subordinate.</p>
<p>Seraine bit her lower lip. Of course she knew Airun. She was currently the most famous knight in Kruni, and one of the leading candidates for the title of the current era’s Strongest Swordsman.</p>
<p>“Tell her we don’t know.”</p>
<p>—…Pardon?</p>
<p>Even though the Transnational Peace Conference was just around the corner, Seraine was unwilling to give Kim Hajin up.</p>
<p>‘A man who can single-handedly stop a war.’</p>
<p>That was Kim Suho’s description of Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>At first, Seraine was skeptical. But now, after witnessing Kim Hajin’s power in person, she had come to consider Kim Suho’s assessment of Kim Hajin an underestimation.</p>
<p>He was the ultimate weapon, much more valuable than a knight; an army of a single man that could replace hundreds of thousands of soldiers.</p>
<p>Seraine also learned from Kim Suho the reason Kim Hajin was so strong. That the source of his strength were his ‘equipment’. More specifically, it was his ‘gun’, a weapon that Kim Hajin invented on his own.</p>
<p>Arunheim probably wouldn’t allow him to carry such a weapon. The Kingdom had strict restrictions on the manufacture of illegal weapons.</p>
<p>“Make up a credible excuse. Tell her that he suddenly disappeared, or better yet, that he’s already left for the Kingdom.”</p>
<p>How dare they label a man of such talent F-rank and wish to get him back?</p>
<p>Talent was like a jewel buried in mud; it belonged to a discerning eye.</p>
<p>—Ah, yes. Okay.</p>
<p>“And please request for correction of the news article and prepare a new ID,” Seraine said with a smile.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-26]</p>
<p>“…Listen carefully.”</p>
<p>In the basement of Shimurin’s workshop, I was currently in the middle of an intense lecture.</p>
<p>If I had to name this lecture— it would be something like ‘How to utilize Stigma’s magic power (by Grand Magician Shimurin)’.</p>
<p>“Your Stigma is a mysterious power indeed. It seems to be in touch with the end of the world,” Shimurin muttered as she stared at my Stigma. Her expression soon stiffened, however, and she remarked flatly, “But there’s something wrong with the way you’re using it.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>This took me by surprise. I thought I’d been using it pretty well until now.</p>
<p>“The way you use magic power is far from efficient. You use it without control, like you’re borrowing it from the outside, like you’re turning water on a faucet, for example. Just like the absolute majority of people,” Shimurin explained.</p>
<p>She then gathered magic power in her right hand. Her magic power clung together to form a distinct ball. It buzzed and vibrated like it would during an ultimate skill.</p>
<p>Next, she gathered magic power in her left hand.</p>
<p>This time, however, her magic power appeared dim. There was no vibration whatsoever.</p>
<p>“Observe the difference. Both contain the same magic power, but their shapes are different.”</p>
<p>“Mm…. Let me try.”</p>
<p>I gathered magic power in my hand as Shimurin had done.</p>
<p>Then, something strange happened. The amount of my magic power was similar to that of Shimurin, but mine seemed faint and less distinct.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>This was the way that I’d been using Stigma my whole life. So how could I be wrong?</p>
<p>Wasn’t Stigma the power to make my wish come true?</p>
<p>“You’re not completely wrong. This is just my way of doing it.” Having noticed my confusion, Shimurin continued with a smirk, “It’ll take a while for you to understand. Most magicians and knights ‘exert’ magic power, but I carefully assemble and ‘place’ magic power….”</p>
<p>As Shimurin’s explanation continued, I decided to use [Setting Intervention] to accelerate my learning.</p>
<p>Taking classes and learning something over a period of time was just unnecessary for someone like me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>▷Arts (3/3)</p>
<p>1. 「Parkour」</p>
<p>2. 「Charming Voice」</p>
<p>3. 「Exuberant Spirit Power Utilization Technique」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I deleted the second Art, 「Charming Voice」, and added a new Art in the empty slot.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>▷Third Art (3/3)</p>
<p>「Shimurin’s Teachings」</p>
<p>[Calculating rank… High-intermediate]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Since I was in the process of learning this Art directly from Shimurin, my guess was that the amount of SP required wouldn’t be as much.</p>
<p>[The original cost is 6,500 SP. However, you’re currently learning this technique from a teacher (Shimurin).]</p>
<p>[The required cost is 3,500 SP. Would you like to save?]</p>
<p>3,500 SP.</p>
<p>It was more than I expected. Fortunately, I had 3,546 SP on me.</p>
<p>Because I’d been earning SP even inside the Gate, the amount was just barely enough.</p>
<p>[Saving Arts.]</p>
<p>[…Your luck activates!]</p>
<p>[Shimurin’s Teachings has increased to high-rank!]</p>
<p>At that moment, knowledge, experience, practice, function, and ideas began to flow into my head and my body.</p>
<p>“…Do you understand? If a typical magician wishes to use magic through the process of ‘assembly’, it will take her at least 10 minutes per spell. But I, with my efficient assembly skill-”</p>
<p>“I think I get it.”</p>
<p>Though Shimurin hadn’t finished speaking, I announced confidently.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Shimurin frowned.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are?”</p>
<p>“Huhu.”</p>
<p>I smiled confidently, and— just like Shimurin’s Teachings explained, I assembled Stigma ‘inside my body’ and released it outward.</p>
<p><em>Guooo….</em></p>
<p>Though I had used the same amount of magic power as before, it was much more clear and flawless, vibrating and resonating violently like an earthquake.</p>
<p>Shimurin’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shimurin was speechless.</p>
<p>She couldn’t take her eyes off of my ball of magic power. She was clearly shocked beyond belief.</p>
<p>“I learned something new. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Sincerely grateful, I bowed to Shimurin.</p>
<p>I had never thought to assemble Stigma ‘inside my body’. Shimurin wasn’t called the grand magician for nothing.</p>
<p><em>Tok tok—</em></p>
<p>It was then that we heard a knock.</p>
<p>I opened the basement door instead of Shimurin who had frozen up like a statue.</p>
<p>“Who… huh?”</p>
<p>In front of me were familiar faces.</p>
<p>First was Leon Clan’s Harin, who had climbed the mountain range with me, and second was Seraine, the daughter of the Republic’s president.</p>
<p>“Have you been well?”</p>
<p>Harin greeted me first.</p>
<p>From her relaxed smile, I could tell things had gone well for her.</p>
<p>“I have. Are you done with your verification procedure?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it went well. Harin-ssi will be staying here at the Republic,” Seraine answered my question this time.</p>
<p>She showed me an ID card.</p>
<p>[Citizen — Seyeon]</p>
<p>“This is Harin’s new identity.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>“And this…”</p>
<p>Seraine took out another card.</p>
<p>“…is yours. Your new identity, Hajin-ssi.”</p>
<p>I tilted my head in confusion and looked closely at the ID card.</p>
<p>[Head of Presidential Security Service — Heiji]</p>
<p>“…Heiji?”</p>
<p>“It’s your new name. If you want to stay in the Republic-”</p>
<p>“No, not that.”</p>
<p>Head of Presidential Security Service.</p>
<p>The word ‘head’ confused me. My initial status in this world was an F-rank sharpshooter.</p>
<p>“The head?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s your new position. To get things done properly, you need to be in a position of power, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Seraine looked at my dumbfounded face and smiled.</p>
<p>“Now, please stay here at the Republic. I promise you 10 times, no, 100 times the treatment you received at Arunheim.”</p>
<p>No matter how much I thought about it, her smile looked too much like Yoo Yeonha’s.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-25]</p>
<p>The burning afternoon sun was beating down on the backyard of the Priton Mansion.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk poured a bucket of cold water on Shin Jonghak who had collapsed after their duel.</p>
<p>“Uhohuh—!”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak sprang up with a strange scream.</p>
<p>“What the hell is wrong with you? Do you wanna die?”</p>
<p>Despite Shin Jonghak’s threat, Jin Sahyuk just smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who said losers don’t get to complain.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak laid back on the ground without a word, for it was true that he had lost to her.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glanced at Shin Jonghak and asked, “Have you thought about it?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>A few days ago, Jin Sahyuk proposed a plan to Shin Jonghak. He had yet to answer her.</p>
<p>“…We don’t have much time. Everything will be over in 3 weeks.”</p>
<p>“3 weeks is a long time.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned at Shin Jonghak’s nonchalant answer.</p>
<p>“Loser.”</p>
<p>“Asshole.”</p>
<p>“…Why are you acting so childish?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s face distorted into a frown.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>From the far corner of Priton’s backyard…</p>
<p>“Hey—!”</p>
<p>…the person who was the reason for Shin Jonghak’s childishness appeared.</p>
<p>“Fight me! I got all of my equipment back. You’re so dead!”</p>
<p>It was Chae Nayun, holding a longsword in her hand.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 328. Transnational Peace Conference (4)</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-24]</p>
<p>I was at the President’s residence located at the heart of the capital. To be exact, I was at the office of the President’s Secret Service Institute. It was imposing but had substance and was well-cleaned.</p>
<p>With a director’s suit hanging in the closet, a teakwood desk, and a clearly luxurious black chair, the room was the perfect director’s office.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>I ended up becoming Head of Presidential Secret Service. I tried sitting on the chair. It was comfy.</p>
<p>I picked up the nameplate on the desk with the words, [Director of the Secret Service Heiji], written on it. It was heavy.</p>
<p>“Hm….”</p>
<p>Seraine told me that my job was the protect the core members of the Republic, including the President and other high-ranking officials. Now that I recovered my stats to a certain degree, it wasn’t so difficult.</p>
<p>—You’re at work?</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice rang out from the desk. Startled, I stared at the desk. The crystal ball standing on a miniature pedestal at the corner of the desk was shaking.</p>
<p>“…Ah, yes, I am.”</p>
<p>I replied.</p>
<p>—Great. Your job as the director is simple. All you have to do is protect my father and I during the upcoming Transnational Peace Conference. Oh, and also other high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>Seraine mentioned the Transnational Peace Conference. For a moment, I stood still without replying. If Baal would really descend that day, I wasn’t sure if I could annihilate him, who was the strongest devil in existence.</p>
<p>—Your subordinate will arrive soon. The Secret Service is something we quickly formed, so it doesn’t have many employees.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>Someone knocked on the door at the perfect timing.</p>
<p>—Ah, that person must be here. Then please take care.</p>
<p>The crystal ball stopped shaking, and Seraine’s voice cut off.</p>
<p><em>Tokk, tok—</em></p>
<p>The knocking continued.</p>
<p>I walked to the door and opened it myself.</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>I saw an unexpected face.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>Her mouth curled up into a beautiful smile, and her blue eyes shone radiantly like jewels.</p>
<p>“My name is Rachel.”</p>
<p>My first subordinate was the elementalist swordswoman, Rachel.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-23]</p>
<p>I went out on a business trip with Rachel. The goal was to inspect the Plaza of Glory, where the Transnational Peace Conference would take place.</p>
<p>“The plaza is spacious, but I hear the conference will take place in that small temple-like place.”</p>
<p>I nodded my head at Rachel’s explanation.</p>
<p>The Plaza of Glory was located in the Republic’s capital. The place was too open to properly protect a large number of people, but the ‘International Summit’, the most important part of the conference, would take place in the small temple at the corner of the plaza. Since there was a high ground in the center of the plaza to serve as a watchtower, seeking out threats should be easy.</p>
<p>“…The problem is that there’s only one enemy.”</p>
<p>But we already knew there weren’t multiple enemies.</p>
<p>There was only one, the world’s strongest evil god and the rank 1 devil, Baal.</p>
<p>“I’m sure we can win.”</p>
<p>Rachel encouraged me with a smile.</p>
<p>“Well, we can only hope that’s the case….”</p>
<p>Just as I was about to smile back at her…</p>
<p><em>Jiing—</em></p>
<p>I felt a strange, penetrating gaze on me.</p>
<p>Feeling the intensity of it, I paused and tracked the source of the gaze. The Thousand-Mile Eyes easily spotted the person glaring at me.</p>
<p>“…What.”</p>
<p>My thoughts cut off for a moment. The culprit was someone I knew. In fact, it was someone I was very close to.</p>
<p>The woman named Yi Byul was hiding behind a wall, glaring at me.</p>
<p>Has she been following me this entire time?</p>
<p>“Hajin-ssi? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Uh… nothing. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>I walked through the plaza with Rachel and checked up on Boss at the same time. She was still following us while hiding her presence.</p>
<p>“…I am a bit worried. I hope she’s doing well.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Rachel spoke up. She was talking about Evandel.</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly and nodded my head.</p>
<p>“I’m sure she is. She has Hayang and Ah Hae-In-ssi with her.”</p>
<p>Plus, Spartan should be playing with her as well. Both Ah Hae-In and Spartan were people I could trust.</p>
<p>“…Yes, I think she’ll be as cheery as always. She’s like me, after all.”</p>
<p>Rachel said proudly.</p>
<p>“You’re right.”</p>
<p>I stared at Rachel and laughed. Then, I remembered something.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, Rachel-ssi, what happened with Lancaster?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah… I’m not really sure.”</p>
<p>“…You don’t think he followed you all the way here, do you?”</p>
<p>I said jokingly. Rachel also took it as a joke and laughed.</p>
<p>“Haha, what if he really is? Lancaster might…”</p>
<p>Rachel replied light-heartedly. But as I thought more about it, a chill went down my back. This wasn’t something to laugh about. If Lancaster was alive, he most definitely would have followed Rachel to this world….</p>
<p>“Well, there’s no use worrying about ifs.”</p>
<p>To be honest, I was more worried about Boss, who kept following us secretly. Her gaze also seemed to carry more and more killing intent as time passed.</p>
<p>“Should we go back now?”</p>
<p>“Go back?”</p>
<p>“There isn’t much to inspect, and there’s something I need to do.”</p>
<p>Rachel stared at me for a moment and then smiled like she knew what I meant.</p>
<p>“Ah~ I understand. Then let’s do that. See you later.”</p>
<p>Rachel spun back. <em>Ssk—</em> The nearby trees shook, as if to react to her movements, and a cherry blossom-like flower fell on her shoulder.</p>
<p>I said to her back.</p>
<p>“See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>After sending Rachel off…</p>
<p>I assembled Stigma’s magic power according to Shimurin’s teachings.</p>
<p>I planned to use ‘Teleportation’ to appear behind Boss’s back.</p>
<p><em>Woong—</em></p>
<p>My feet seemed to float. In the next moment, my surrounding scenery shifted.</p>
<p>“…Where did he go?”</p>
<p>Boss peeked her head out like a meerkat and stared at the spot I disappeared from. I placed my hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Startled, Boss turned around.</p>
<p>“What….”</p>
<p>Her eyes, nose, and mouth widened when she saw me. I gave her a grin.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Uh… nothing.”</p>
<p>Boss pushed her hair back and coughed.</p>
<p>I stared at her fixedly. Boss was wearing casual clothes and not the robe she usually wore. Frankly, she was even more beautiful in casual clothes.</p>
<p>“Nothing much… just….”</p>
<p>“Just?”</p>
<p>I smiled faintly and grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re not busy, why don’t you go on a walk with me?”</p>
<p>With the plaza being so beautiful, I wanted to stroll around with Boss openly.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-16]</p>
<p>“…I won—!”</p>
<p>In Priton Mansion’s backyard, Chae Nayun’s voice cut through the air. Lying on the ground next to her was a pair of man and woman. One was Shin Jonghak, who had already fainted, and the other was Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>The surrounding area revealed that a fierce battle had occurred.</p>
<p>“Whew… I’m exhausted.”</p>
<p>With a faint sigh, Chae Nayun staggered until she plopped down on the ground. Jin Sahyuk turned her head slightly sideways and stared at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“…Aren’t you embarrassed?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun flinched for a split second before she turned to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>She had certainly won against Jin Sahyuk. But the problem lied in the process. Chae Nayun had teamed up with Shin Jonghak to fight Jin Sahyuk. Right, it was a 2 on 1 battle.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun dodged Jin Sahyuk’s gaze without replying.</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk smirked and raised her body.</p>
<p>“Eh? You can still stand? I thought you were out!”</p>
<p>What Chae Nayun didn’t know was that Jin Sahyuk’s Authority gave her an insane rate of recovery.</p>
<p>“I’m different from you.”</p>
<p>“…Ha, there you go again, being annoying. Just wait. I’ll be ready to go in three minutes—”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk ignored Chae Nayun and entered the mansion. A maid greeted her.</p>
<p>“Shall I prepare your meal?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was staying in the mansion as Shin Jonghak’s guest. She walked up the stairs to her room on the fourth floor.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>But after she opened the door…</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>She was faced with an unexpected guest. A robed man stood tall in her room. The sword on his waist was taller than him, and Jin Sahyuk easily recognized his appearance.</p>
<p>“Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho had come to see her.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at Kim Suho and smiled.</p>
<p>Kim Suho took off his robe and faced her with a stiff expression.</p>
<p>The tension broke when Jin Sahyuk spoke.</p>
<p>“You’re finally here.”</p>
<p>“…You knew I’d come?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s eyebrows went up at how confident she was.</p>
<p>“…I came to hear your plan.”</p>
<p>“Oh? That’s a surprise. You’re going to trust me?”</p>
<p>“I know you’re not a liar.”</p>
<p>This time, Jin Sahyuk’s stiff expression changed. The corner of her mouth twisted up.</p>
<p>“Right, right. I don’t lie. But….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glanced behind Kim Suho. The person she was looking for wasn’t here.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin’s not here?”</p>
<p>“Hajin? I didn’t think I needed to bring him with me.”</p>
<p>“…Tsk, useless.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk clicked her tongue, then pushed Kim Suho to the side and sat down on her bed.</p>
<p>Kim Suho glared at Jin Sahyuk and said imposingly.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you know and what you’re planning to—”</p>
<p>“There’s 16 days until Baal’s descent.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk interrupted Kim Suho and said with a serious face.</p>
<p>“Before then, you need to kill Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Priton Mansion after Kim Suho’s departure.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at the ceiling on her bed. It was already dark outside, and a cool breeze entered the room through the opened window.</p>
<p>“…It’s almost time.”</p>
<p>She murmured quietly as the night made her a bit more emotional.</p>
<p>“The return to my beloved home. The ending I strived for my entire life. Soon, my life’s purpose will be fulfilled….”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice that wasn’t Jin Sahyuk’s rang out.</p>
<p>The voice arrived suddenly with no trackable source.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk even wondered if the voice came from her heart.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>But she knew that couldn’t be the case. She blankly raised her head.</p>
<p>“I’m going to ask again.”</p>
<p>A man was standing next to her bed.</p>
<p>The moment Jin Sahyuk saw him, a smile emerged on her face.</p>
<p>“…It’s you.”</p>
<p>A black robe inscribed with a lotus flower covered his body, and his face was fully covered by a mask. Still, Jin Sahyuk knew who the man was.</p>
<p>“You told Kim Suho that we had to kill Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>He was the infamous Black Lotus, but his real name was Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“Explain to me in detail.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at Kim Hajin. Perhaps because it had been a while since she last saw him, she felt happy. She wanted to keep staring at his eyes.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“How long have you been watching me?”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin didn’t answer. He had followed Kim Suho secretly and had watched his conversation with Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“A while ago.”</p>
<p>Just as Kim Hajin was about to speak…</p>
<p>—HEY!</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>A loud shout rang out, and Jin Sahyuk’s door burst open. Chae Nayun stomped in from the other side.</p>
<p>“Is it true that Kim Suho came and le…?”</p>
<p>But Chae Nayun couldn’t finish her sentence. She noticed the robed man standing in Jin Sahyuk’s room.</p>
<p>“Uh….”</p>
<p>Her eyes naturally fell on the lotus symbol on his robe. A jet-black robe with a lotus symbol.</p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun jumped slightly. The robe was clearly a symbol of Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“Who’s….”</p>
<p>Black Lotus was well-known by both Heroes and Djinns. Some worshipped him like an idol and some despised him. Some called him the world’s strongest man, and some criticized him as the world’s worst criminal.</p>
<p>He was both an anti-hero and a villain.</p>
<p>Seeing Black Lotus up front, Chae Nayun’s eyes widened to a full circle.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kim Hajin was drenched in cold sweat under his robe. He was flustered to the point his thoughts temporary stopped, but he quickly regained his calm.</p>
<p>Even with Chae Nayun’s incredible intuition, there was little chance she would figure out his identity. After all, the Black Lotus Uniform was designed to hide his identity.</p>
<p>Even Chae Nayun’s sharp senses shouldn’t be able to see through the equipment made with Dwarf’s Dexterity…</p>
<p>“…Puhaha.”</p>
<p>While Chae Nayun and Kim Hajin were standing in a daze, Jin Sahyuk burst into laughter and got up.</p>
<p>“Looks like even an idiot like you knows who he is.”</p>
<p>“…Idiot?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun scowled. Jin Sahyuk grabbed Kim Hajin by his collar and said to Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“Let me introduce him. He’s my friend, Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 329. Ten Days (1)</p>
<p>“Let me introduce him. He’s my friend, Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said as she grabbed Black Lotus by his collar. Black Lotus immediately threw her a sharp gaze, and Chae Nayun looked back and forth between Jin Sahyuk and Black Lotus.</p>
<p>“…Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun muttered quietly.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin still kept his mouth shut. Now that the Art that allowed him to change his voice was gone, he feared there was a chance he might be discovered if he talked.</p>
<p>Staring fixedly at Black Lotus, Chae Nayun asked in a stiff tone.</p>
<p>“Oi, why did you invite a thief?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk tilted her head.</p>
<p>“What thief? Isn’t he a legend to you?”</p>
<p>“Legend my ass. Now that I think about it, Jin Sahyuk, you’re with the Chameleon Troupe! Like Cheok Jungyeong that bastard….</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk smirked at Chae Nayun’s aggressive tone.</p>
<p>“Think what you want.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk let go of Black Lotus’s collar. Black Lotus promptly took a step back.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said to Chae Nayun, “Alright, well I have something to discuss with Lotus.”</p>
<p>“…Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Chae Nayun left the room with protest.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>She purposely shut the door hard, but it was obvious she intended to eavesdrop from the other side. After all, a mere wall shouldn’t be able to block her sharp hearing if she focused.</p>
<p>“Now then….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk must have noticed Chae Nayun’s intentions too. But with a mischievous smile, she continued on from before.</p>
<p>“Are you going to kill Yi Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin didn’t answer her. Jin Sahyuk stole a glance at the door and continued.</p>
<p>“Yi Yeonjun is trying to become Baal by succeeding the position of the incarnation body. But if that crazy bastard returns to Earth as Baal, it’s obvious what will happen to it. He’s far more evil than Bell will ever be.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was without doubt the most evil human being Jin Sahyuk knew. He was someone whose very root of existence was pure evil.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk knew this. That Yi Yeonjun was currently infatuated with Baal.</p>
<p>“So… Lotus, are you going to kill Yi Yeonjun? Or….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk paused for a moment. The corner of her lips twisted up.</p>
<p>“Will you let Kim Hajin kill him?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>…Brrrr.</p>
<p>Both Kim Hajin and Jin Sahyuk felt someone’s presence outside the room. It was obviously Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glanced at the door once more and continued.</p>
<p>“You should know what this means. It doesn’t matter which one of you kills Yi Yeonjun, but one of you must do it.”</p>
<p>Kill Yi Yeonjun yourself— That was what Jin Sahyuk was saying.</p>
<p>“But if I were to guess… I’d say Kim Hajin will be the one to kill him.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sniggered and released her magic power. It slowly wrapped around Kim Hajin’s body, but as it carried no hostility or killing intent, Kim Hajin stayed still.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk opened her mouth in that state.</p>
<p>“If you look at it from a bigger picture, it’s Yi Yeonjun’s fault that Kim Hajin had no choice but to kill Chae Jinyoon.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s sudden nonsensical comment was one that Kim Hajin couldn’t ignore. His eyes immediately shot open, and shock emerged from his pupils.</p>
<p>“Like I said, if you look at it from a bigger picture.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said mischievously. But their conversation was forced to a stop then. Chae Nayun, who was eavesdropping from the outside, burst into the room again.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>The door opened roughly. Chae Nayun was glaring at them with a shocked expression.</p>
<p>“Hey! What did you mean by—”</p>
<p>But Kim Hajin couldn’t hear the rest of her sentence.</p>
<p><em>Woong….</em></p>
<p>When Jin Sahyuk activated her Reality Manipulation, her magic power stuck to Kim Hajin reacted. <em>Chwaaaa—</em> A brilliant light shot out.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin closed his eyes momentarily before opening them again. Surprisingly, he found himself standing in the middle of a forest.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had teleported him far away from Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea, Seoul]</p>
<p>After the opening of the Demon Realm Gate, large-scale calamities descended one after the other.</p>
<p>First, Demon Realm Transformation sped up rapidly. Previously, it was confined to Manchu and the Ural Mountain Range. Now, it had spread to Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Northern Europe. Over 20% of Earth became corrupted.</p>
<p>Of course, humanity didn’t just sit around and wait.</p>
<p>Researchers around the world discovered that mana stones delayed the progress of Demon Realm Transformation. Next, with the power of [Dimensional Entropy], Essential Dynamics succeeded in creating more mana stones. As a result, the speed of Demon Realm transformation diminished noticeably.</p>
<p>However, another problem arose due to Djinns and demons.</p>
<p>When Pandemonium partially went through Demon Realm Transformation, demons took over the land, and the Djinns that were chased out went into human society, causing chaos.</p>
<p>The politically moderate argued that ‘Djinns served different devils, and there were non-hostile Djinns who served non-hostile devils’. They encouraged distinction between evil and non-evil Djinns, but their opponents argued that Djinns were fundamental evildoers who belonged in prison.</p>
<p>And so, the current political climate was charged with chaos and anger.</p>
<p>[Tower of Heroes], the headquarter of the Hero Association.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Two noble guests, Chae Joochul and Heynckes, were staring at each other. Chae Joochul was just as expressionless as always, while Heynckes shrugged his shoulders as if he had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>“Are you finished?”</p>
<p>A gentle voice flowed into their ears. Chae Joochul and Heynckes both turned to the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>Standing there was a woman who had died once but now had revived.</p>
<p>“I can leave then, right?”</p>
<p>The first Descender – Medea.</p>
<p>She didn’t cower in the slightest in front of Chae Joochul and Heynckes, two of Earth’s strongest fighters. In fact, she treated them like children and laughed at their actions.</p>
<p>“What kind of life do you plan on leading from now?”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul stopped Medea and asked.</p>
<p>Medea stared at Chae Joochul, as if she were looking at a cute puppy, and touched her lips with her finger.</p>
<p>“Let me think… Since I’m the first Descender….”</p>
<p>The First Descender. Medea liked this title. Athena, Lü Bu, and others were looking for opportunities to descend, but she knew they were far from ready.</p>
<p>“I’m going to live beautifully. I heard Seoul is the richest and most powerful city. So I’m going to build a huge mansion in Seoul. I’ll have my workshop in the basement and have about a hundred servants serving me.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul and Heynckes exchanged glances once again. For someone who was called a witch, the lifestyle she wished for seemed too simple.</p>
<p>Once the brief exchange between the two men was over, Heynckes opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“We can do that much for you. But—”</p>
<p>“By the way, when will you two stop using casual speech? I’m a couple thousand years older, you know?”</p>
<p>Medea furrowed her brows unhappily.</p>
<p>With a peeved look, Heynckes nodded his head.</p>
<p>“…We can grant you that. But, will you be willing to help us in return?”</p>
<p>Heynckes didn’t argue and used polite speech with her. A smile immediately bloomed on Medea’s face.</p>
<p>“You’re saying the same thing as that man.”</p>
<p>Heynckes furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>“That man?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you don’t need to know. He’s far more delicate and valuable than you two.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Hearing this, even Chae Joochul frowned a little. Neither him nor Heynckes could think of any man who would fit that description.</p>
<p>“Well, anyways.”</p>
<p>Medea smirked.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. I don’t want the world I’m going to live in to be dirtied either.”</p>
<p>She spun around and flapped her ceremonial dress. This heavenly dress was the epitome of perfection, crafted by the successor of the dwarves, Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“My true name is Medea. As an ancient demigod and a sorceress, I shall lend you my strength.”</p>
<p>Immediately, suppressed magic power rose up from Medea’s body. Her insurmountable magic power swirled inside the room.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>In that instant, both Chae Joochul and Heynckes stared at each other.</p>
<p>Heynckes said with his eyes, ‘Looks like things worked out, friend.’</p>
<p>Chae Joochul replied with his eyes, ‘Indeed.’</p>
<p>It was a very Chae Joochul-like response.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-10]</p>
<p>Only ten days were left until the Transnational Peace Conference. I looked out of the window of the director’s office and sighed. Birds flew in the clear, blue sky. Everything seemed peaceful.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>But my mind was far from peaceful. I recovered my strength and reclaimed my equipment, including the Godslaying Bullet, yet my worries stayed with me.</p>
<p>Both Baal and what Jin Sahyuk said lingered in my head.</p>
<p>—If you look at it from a bigger picture, it’s Yi Yeonjun’s fault that Kim Hajin had no choice but to kill Chae Jinyoon.</p>
<p>Why did Jin Sahyuk say that? Was it just to provoke me and Chae Nayun? Or did she hear something from Bell?</p>
<p>I managed to find out Yi Yeonjun’s relationship with Boss thanks to Yoo Jinhyuk, but there was still a lot I didn’t know about Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>What could Chae Nayun be thinking about right now?</p>
<p>What could she have talked about with Jin Sahyuk that day?</p>
<p>I was curious, but Chae Nayun had cut off communication with me.</p>
<p>“Is something on your mind?”</p>
<p>Harin asked at that moment.</p>
<p>I turned my head and glanced at Harin. Under the false name of ‘Yurin’, she had joined the Secret Service four days ago. In other words, she was now my subordinate.</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing. What about you? Are you feeling better?”</p>
<p>“Yes, except that I still can’t get used to my name.”</p>
<p>Harin laughed out loud. I smiled bitterly and nodded my head.</p>
<p>“The Transnational Peace Conference is in ten days, but don’t worry too much.”</p>
<p>Harin calmed me down. Frankly, having her with me really was relieving. She wasn’t a half-assed devil hunter like me, but a real one inheriting the lineage of exorcists. She was sure to be a valuable asset in combating Baal.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave it to you, Harin-ssi.”</p>
<p>“…Mm, but I can’t get used to having you be my superior. You used to be the one protecting me.”</p>
<p>“You can talk casually if you want.”</p>
<p>“No, no, it’s fine. I’m not nobility anymore. I’m more comfortable the way things are now.”</p>
<p>Harin smiled calmly as if she found peace in her heart.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok.</em></p>
<p>It was then. Someone knocked on the door.</p>
<p>“Hm? Is it Rachel?”</p>
<p>I tilted my head curiously and opened the door.</p>
<p>“Rachel…?”</p>
<p>On the other side of the door were guests I wasn’t quite expecting.</p>
<p>“Haha… It’s been a while, Hajin.”</p>
<p>A woman scratched her head with an awkward laugh.</p>
<p>“It really has been! Wow!”</p>
<p>And a muscular man tried to hug me with a wide grin.</p>
<p>It was Yun Seung-Ah and Yi Yeonghan.</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>I stared at them blankly. Yun Seung-Ah offered an explanation.</p>
<p>“We were in Krovon Kingdom, which is below the Republic of Leores. We heard from Suho that you were here and came to see you.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>When I nodded my head in a daze, Yi Yeonghan smacked my arm and said loudly.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, there’s someone else who came with us.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“Hey, get over here!”</p>
<p>Hearing Yi Yeonghan’s voice, a large man walked out from behind the wall. When I saw him, I couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p>
<p>He was someone I had a mild conflict with back when I was in Cube.</p>
<p>To be exact, he was beaten up one-sidedly and made his exit early.</p>
<p>“Kuhum… H-Hey, it’s… been a while.”</p>
<p>Because I haven’t seen him in so long, I was somewhat touched.</p>
<p>The man was Shin Jonghak’s old lackey – Kim Horak.</p>
<p>“Yeah, really.”</p>
<p>I grinned and offered him my hand.</p>
<p>Kim Horak flinched, but he smiled in embarrassment and took my hand.</p>
<p>“Yeah… I’m happy to see you.”</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen each other since Cube, right?”</p>
<p>“Y…Yeah.”</p>
<p>I shook hands with Kim Horak. As expected of a close-quarter combatant, his hand was full of calluses.</p>
<p>“Whoa, you have a lot of friends.”</p>
<p>Harin approached us with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. My name is Yurin, the third most influential person of the Secret Service.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Ah, yes, hello. I’m Yun Seung-Ah.”</p>
<p>“Yun Seung-Ah-ssi! What a pretty name. What about you?”</p>
<p>“I’m Yi Yeonghan.”</p>
<p>“Ah~ Yi Yeonghan-ssi.”</p>
<p>Like a true social extravert, Harin greeted the new faces warmly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 330. Ten Days (2)</p>
<p>I contacted Kim Suho and asked about the sudden arrivals. He responded that he sent people that he discovered from Earth to me.</p>
<p>With that, the Secret Service now had seven members – Harin, Aileen, Rachel, Yi Yeonghan, Kim Horak, Yun Seung-Ah, and me.</p>
<p>“…Really~”</p>
<p>Inside the director’s office, the Spirit Speech Master, Aileen, murmured with her legs crossed.</p>
<p>She was originally Kim Suho’s maid but had now been promoted to the Manager position of the Secret Service. That was one thing that the newly created institution made convenient.</p>
<p>“Yes, so to sum it up again, we need to work together to defeat Baal.”</p>
<p>Rachel summarized the plan once more.</p>
<p>“And there’s something else.”</p>
<p>I planned to add one more goal to our mission.</p>
<p>“Something else?”</p>
<p>Aileen, Rachel and the others all turned their attention to me.</p>
<p>I showed them a portrait.</p>
<p>“This person.”</p>
<p>It was the portrait I made using the Book of Truth.</p>
<p>Aileen and Yun Seung-Ah seemed to know him, as they raised their eyebrows, and the other five tilted their heads curiously.</p>
<p>“Who is… this?”</p>
<p>Rachel asked me, but Aileen was the one who answered.</p>
<p>“He should be the previous boss of the Chameleon Troupe, back when the group wasn’t well-known. He was a criminal on the Hero Association’s Blacklist. From what I remember, he was the first person to be placed on the Blacklist as a single entity. Now, it’s a lot different with Wicked and the other Nine Evils.”</p>
<p>With that, Aileen leaned against the back of her chair.</p>
<p>“Blacklist…?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonghan asked somewhat nervously.</p>
<p>The Association’s Blacklist was reserved for the most heinous villains and Djinns. It was believed that one had to at least be a Master-rank Hero to have any chance of killing a Blacklisted target. There were even rumors that the requirement for a high-rank Hero to rise to the Master-rank was to kill a Blacklisted target.</p>
<p>“Yep. Back in my time, the Chameleon Troupe was a lot more vicious than they are now. They used to abduct and sell people, take on assassination requests practically every week… Huaam.”</p>
<p>Aileen yawned. She stretched her arms out and then continued.</p>
<p>“But now, they aren’t that vicious. They’re still considered a group of bandits, but not only do they reject unnecessary murder and massacre, they even got themselves off the Association’s wanted list after helping them with the Orden Incident. And the reason the Chameleon Troupe changed so much is…”</p>
<p>Aileen paused and held up the portrait.</p>
<p>“Because this man isn’t their leader. He died a long time ago, and the Chameleon Troupe was reborn under a new leader.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Aileen tapped on the portrait and continued.</p>
<p>“So, since he’s dead, we can’t find him even if we want to.”</p>
<p>“She’s right, Hajin.”</p>
<p>I chuckled. Everyone who knew a thing or two about the Chameleon Troupe would think the same way as Aileen and Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>“No, that man is alive.”</p>
<p>So I spoke firmly. I had confirmed that Yi Yeonjun was alive with my own eyes. According to Jin Sahyuk, he had been ‘frozen’ all this time.</p>
<p>“His name is Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>I pointed at the portrait and continued.</p>
<p>“He faked his death and he is now in this place. He should be in the Arunheim Kingdom, but he will eventually come to the Republic.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Aileen and Yun Seung-Ah’s expressions turned serious.</p>
<p>“We have to kill Yi Yeonjun before Baal’s descent.”</p>
<p>“No, wait, I don’t understand. How can he be—”</p>
<p>“You can understand slowly. For now, we have to get ready.”</p>
<p>Leaving behind Aileen who was still in shock, I turned to Harin. She didn’t seem to follow what we said, as she was taking down notes.</p>
<p>“Yurin-ssi?”</p>
<p>“…H-Huh? Ah, yes.”</p>
<p>Harin quickly paused and looked up at me.</p>
<p>I smiled at her as gently as possible and made a request.</p>
<p>“Please teach us how to hunt a devil.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Arunheim Kingdom – Guest Room]</p>
<p>The sky was both dark and bright as if the stars were about to fall out of the sky. On this cold, winter night, Jin Sahyuk came to see Yi Yeonjun. Jin Sahyuk asked to talk to him, and Yi Yeonjun happily obliged.</p>
<p>The two of them sat across each other at the table in the guest room balcony. The stares they exchanged were cold, and neither side revealed a hint of weakness.</p>
<p>“…Let me ask you one thing.”</p>
<p>In this tense atmosphere, Jin Sahyuk sparked the conversation.</p>
<p>“It can be more if you’d like.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked without even the slightest change in her expression.</p>
<p>“Why do you want to be with Baal?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Isn’t that question a little—”</p>
<p>“All Baal can do is destroy Earth. If Earth is destroyed, you won’t be able to obtain anything. Since you aren’t the true incarnation body, you won’t be able to form an equal relationship like Bell and Baal. You will just end up being Baal’s slave.”</p>
<p>Bell had lived for hundreds of years as Baal’s incarnation body. As Bell was incapable of dying, he had the ability to resist Baal. Once Baal successfully descended, perhaps Bell might even return to being ‘human’.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the case for Yi Yeonjun. If he accepted Baal… he would become Baal’s slave and rampage until death.</p>
<p>“…It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>But Yi Yeonjun replied that it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk threw a question.</p>
<p>“Mm… Who knows?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun thought about the environment he grew up in and the events that shaped his personality.</p>
<p>A baby who was born an orphan.</p>
<p>A child who was only used by adults.</p>
<p>A youth who became vicious in order to appear strong.</p>
<p>Even at a glance, the world was nothing but a target of anger and resentment to Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“It will be destroyed even without me, so I want to destroy it myself.”</p>
<p>“…Pft, what a petty answer.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it? I fully agree.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun replied honestly to Jin Sahyuk’s snarky comment.</p>
<p>But at the same time, memories of the past flashed inside his head.</p>
<p>The violence and abuse he suffered in the orphanage.</p>
<p>His friend and lover’s betrayals.</p>
<p>The time he killed the two people who abandoned him with his own hands.</p>
<p>…And the days of his youth where he constantly told himself, “it’s this damned world who made me this way.”</p>
<p>“You realize how stupid that is, right?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun chuckled at Jin Sahyuk’s question.</p>
<p>“Of course, I do. I do, but…”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun paused. Then, he remembered what once used to be his – the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>Bell and Rumi.</p>
<p>Byul and Jain.</p>
<p>The days he spent with them and the rest of the troupe could perhaps be called fond memories.</p>
<p>But those days belonged to <em>his</em> Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>“But….”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun clenched his teeth. Now, those memories had all lost their light. Byul had inherited the Chameleon Troupe, and she had been dirtied by someone he didn’t know.</p>
<p>“I have nothing left.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of death.</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid of being forgotten.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“So I have no choice but to destroy it all.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t accept his ‘belongings’ being stolen from him.</p>
<p>“…You’re insane.”</p>
<p>In that instant, Jin Sahyuk couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun glared at Jin Sahyuk and continued.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have anything to do with you anyways. I promised you that I’d open a dimensional portal to Akatrina. That promise will stand even if I become Baal.”</p>
<p>As he said this, Yi Yeonjun calmly stared at Jin Sahyuk. Then, he continued with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Becoming one with Baal and putting myself in an endless loop of destruction and death. That seems like a wonderful end to my pitiful life.”</p>
<p>Looking at him like this, Jin Sahyuk thought Yi Yeonjun resembled her. To be exact, her past self before she met Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>A bitter taste lingered in her mouth.</p>
<p>“…Let’s stop here.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sighed and rose from her seat.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Same time, Arunheim Kingdom’s Priton Mansion.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was racking her head with Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“So, for whatever reason, Kim Hajin and Black Lotus are fighting,” Chae Nayun explained.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak frowned and tilted his head.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin is fighting Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>“Well, something like that. I know they’re both competing to kill Yi Yeonjun or something.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun demanded a more detailed explanation from Jin Sahyuk, but Jin Sahyuk remained silent in matters regarding Kim Hajin and Black Lotus’s relationship.</p>
<p>…In truth, Jin Sahyuk gave Chae Nayun a chance. That she would tell her if Chae Nayun beat her in a one-on-one fight.</p>
<p>But Chae Nayun couldn’t defeat Jin Sahyuk. Most likely, she wouldn’t be able to until the end of the Transnational Peace Conference. Just as Shin Jonghak said, her compatibility with Jin Sahyuk was the absolute worst.</p>
<p>“Yi Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak asked again.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Kim Hajin is trying to kill Yi Yeonjun. As for why….”</p>
<p>—If you look at it from a bigger picture, it’s Yi Yeonjun’s fault that Kim Hajin had no choice but to kill Chae Jinyoon.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s voice constantly lingered in Chae Nayun’s mind.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>“…It might be related to Oppa.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak didn’t say anything. He simply nodded his head. He knew how sensitive Chae Nayun was when it came to Chae Jinyoon.</p>
<p>“Anyways!”</p>
<p><em>Chak—!</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun clapped all of a sudden.</p>
<p>“I was thinking, we should brainstorm together.”</p>
<p>“…Brainstorm what?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak scratched his head.</p>
<p>“You know, let’s think and come up with theories. How Kim Hajin, Black Lotus, and Yi Yeonjun are related, why Black Lotus is trying to kill the former leader of his group, and why Kim Hajin is trying to kill Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun put down a notebook on the table. It was filled with notes on the theories she came up with.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. If we rack our heads together, there’s nothing we can’t solve.”</p>
<p>“…If you want.”</p>
<p>“Great. Then let’s begin!”</p>
<p>Just like that, Chae Nayun and Shin Jonghak sat together and fell in thought. Several theories flew around their heads and notes.</p>
<p>As a result…</p>
<p>“N-Nayun, the person who planted the Devil’s Seed in your older brother…. What if that was Yi Yeonjun?”</p>
<p>…Shin Jonghak arrived at a shocking hypothesis…</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>…And Chae Nayun’s eyes widened like a frightened rabbit.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-7]</p>
<p>Only a week remained until the Transnational Peace Conference.</p>
<p>The Republic’s night brightened up with artificial nights, and the sound of civilization rang out both day and night from the countless people who came to the Republic of Leores to watch or participate in the Transnational Peace Conference.</p>
<p>—Can you see well from there, Director?</p>
<p>As Director of the Secret Service, I was overseeing a part of the security operations for the conference. Looking down from the watchtower in the middle of Leores Plaza, I kept my eyes out for terrorists.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Kim Horak, there’s a suspicious individual wearing a black hat to the northwest of where you’re standing. He has bombs on him too.”</p>
<p>—Understood.</p>
<p>Kim Horak followed my command. He approached the man and quickly subdued him and took away his ‘bombs’.</p>
<p>…Seeing Kim Horak who did exactly as he was told, I realized why Shin Jonghak ordered him around like a loyal dog.</p>
<p>—Here, take him away.</p>
<p>Kim Horak handed the man over once other security forces arrived.</p>
<p>“Good job. Looks like there’s nothing else to worry about within a 3-kilometer radius, so it looks like we can rest….”</p>
<p>Just as we were communicating through a crystal ball, I suddenly caught sight of someone.</p>
<p>“…Wait, attention.”</p>
<p>There was an individual wearing a grey robe.</p>
<p>However, my Thousand-Mile Eyes easily penetrated his robe and saw the face hiding underneath it. As expected… it was Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>‘Found him.’</p>
<p>I smiled in satisfaction. It was then. My expression stiffened once again.</p>
<p>—Director? What happened?</p>
<p>—Oi, Director?</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell them Yi Yeonjun was nearby.</p>
<p>Boss was with Shimurin just a short distance away.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 331. Ten Days (3)</p>
<p>“I….”</p>
<p>I studied the situation from the watchtower. Boss and Shimurin were munching on snacks from a street stall, and Yi Yeonjun was wandering about nearby.</p>
<p>Not causing a huge commotion seemed to be most important.</p>
<p>“I found Yi Yeonjun.”</p>
<p>—What? Really?!</p>
<p>Aileen’s surprised voice rang out from the crystal ball.</p>
<p>“Yes, but we need to act reserved. For now, I’m just going to keep an eye on him.”</p>
<p>I would never let Yi Yeonjun meet Boss. At least, not until I killed him.</p>
<p>—The plaza <em>is</em> filled with tons of people right now… Can you keep tracking him, Hajin?</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that.”</p>
<p>I answered and slowly released my spirit power. With my stats fully recovered, my ability to wield spirit power returned as well. I should be able to use ‘Miracle Creation’, the ability engraved into my spirit power as the original author.</p>
<p>「Observer」</p>
<p>[Summary – Summons a small bird to monitor a target]</p>
<p>[Activation Condition – User must call the ‘Observer’ directly.]</p>
<p>[Consumption Value – 1% of Kim Hajin’s spirit power per 24 hours.]</p>
<p>[Effect – The Observer can conceal itself while watching its target. It also shares what it sees with Kim Hajin]</p>
<p>I created a Miracle with my spirit power. Since I didn’t have Spartan with me, I needed something to replace it.</p>
<p>“Observer.”</p>
<p>The moment I called its name, spirit power leaked out of my body. The minuscule amount of spirit power formed a small bird which smiled at me.</p>
<p>—Coo.</p>
<p>The cute fuzzball resembled a Korean crow-tit.</p>
<p>I strengthened it with [Random Consolidation System] and set its target to Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“Fly.”</p>
<p>—Coo.</p>
<p>The Observer left my hands and flew into the sky. I closed my eyes and shared the Observer’s vision.</p>
<p>It began to track Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“It’s all good now.”</p>
<p>—I don’t know what that means… but fine. Just to be sure, Yi Yeonjun really is alive?</p>
<p>Aileen’s high-pitched voice rang out from the crystal ball.</p>
<p>I replied with a bitter smile, “Yes, he is. You don’t believe me?”</p>
<p>—I believe you, of course. It’s just that… Ehew, fine, fine…. Huh? No, I ordered a chicken kabob. No, not spicy….</p>
<p><em>Tk.</em> The communication cut off in the middle. It seemed Aileen was busy eating street food as well.</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>I let out a chuckle and went back to observing Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>However, my face went stiff when I saw what happened next.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Boss was staring in a daze with a kabob in her hand. She was looking at a spot 500 meters away, where Yi Yeonjun was standing. Yi Yeonjun had his back toward her. With the grey robe covering him, Boss shouldn’t be able to recognize him.</p>
<p>I quickly took out the crystal ball connected to Boss.</p>
<p>“Boss.”</p>
<p>I called her. Boss flinched for a second and then took out a crystal ball from her pocket.</p>
<p>“Boss, where are you right now?”</p>
<p>—Me? I’m…</p>
<p>Boss took a look around and continued.</p>
<p>—…in front of a street vendor.</p>
<p>“And you haven’t spotted anything strange?”</p>
<p>—No, nothing. What about you? Are things going well?</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>I continued to drag out the conversation until Yi Yeonjun grew farther away from Boss. Thankfully, Yi Yeonjun didn’t see Boss, as he left for somewhere else.</p>
<p>I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Boss.”</p>
<p>—Hm?</p>
<p>“…I think you should go home for today. I think Aileen is near you. Also, contact Jain for me.”</p>
<p>I heard that Jain was now a general for the Arunheim Kingdom.</p>
<p>—Sure, what do you need?</p>
<p>Boss answered. But her complexion seemed dark. The grey-robed figure she saw must be bothering her.</p>
<p>“…Ask her when she’ll arrive at the Republic. You should go back home for now.”</p>
<p>Boss hesitated for a moment and looked around her surroundings. But Yi Yeonjun had already disappeared, and Boss had no choice but to agree.</p>
<p>—Got it.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Sword Commander’s Office]</p>
<p>At the same hour, Kim Suho was in a meeting with Yoo Yeonha about Baal.</p>
<p>“We’ve recovered our strengths for the most part… but Baal’s strength is on a level of its own.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha said seriously.</p>
<p>“There’s no way for us to confirm stories about Baal, but according to Jin Sahyuk, he destroyed the world he descended upon in just four days.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded his head.</p>
<p>An evil god capable of destroying the world in just four days was shocking to hear, to say the least, but that didn’t mean he could sit around and do nothing. If Baal wasn’t stopped here, he would undoubtedly descend on Earth.</p>
<p>“So after hearing about this, I started looking into items used in history for exorcisms. I figured we would need these powerful artifacts to combat such a powerful foe.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha took out a catalog from her desk. Listed on the book were ancient artifacts used for exorcisms that she found out through her merchant group’s connections.</p>
<p>Kim Suho glanced at the catalog, which showed pictures of a sword, bow, spear, talisman, fan, and others.</p>
<p>“Contact the president’s daughter and ask her if she can find any of these.”</p>
<p>“…Seraine-ssi, you mean?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I would buy them myself if I could, but they’re too expensive. We’ll need assets on the level of a nation to acquire them.”</p>
<p>“Mm… I’ll try to ask her.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yoo Yeonha scowled.</p>
<p>“Don’t just <em>try</em>. We <em>need</em> these items. There’s only one week left.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was more serious than ever, and Kim Suho knew he shouldn’t be indecisive.</p>
<p>“…Okay, I’ll ask her even if I have to risk my position.”</p>
<p>“Perfect.”</p>
<p>It was then. Just as the duo were discussing their plans, <em>Tok, Tok—</em> someone knocked on the door.</p>
<p>Speaking of the devil, Seraine’s voice rang out from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>—Sword Commander, it’s me, Seraine.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha stared at each other in bewilderment. Then, they both grinned and nodded their heads.</p>
<p>“Come in, Lady Seraine~ I’ve wanted to see you so much~”</p>
<p>“Aiya! If it isn’t Lady Seraine, the future of our Republic~”</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p>The duo warmly welcomed the ‘guest’ into the office.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Late night.</p>
<p>I returned to Shimurin’s workshop after a long day’s work. Boss and Shimurin were waiting for me at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>“You’re late.”</p>
<p>Boss spoke first, then Shimurin slammed her fist down on the table.</p>
<p>“Right, you’re too late. We almost died of hunger, waiting.”</p>
<p>“…Why didn’t you eat?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Shimurin’s face distorted viciously.</p>
<p>“This is your fault. Because you’re too good at cooking, everything else tastes horrible. So—”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll make you something.”</p>
<p>I chuckled and walked to the kitchen. Shimurin smiled in satisfaction, and Boss’s shoulders danced as well.</p>
<p>Today’s meal was spicy rice cakes, dumplings, and tempura.</p>
<p>After I finished cooking in 15 minutes, Shimurin put a third of it on a plate and went downstairs. She clearly wanted to continue her magical research while eating.</p>
<p><em>Poke, poke, poke.</em> Boss sat on the kitchen table and ate spicy rice cakes with chopsticks. I sat down next to her. When I stared at her, she began to look at me strangely. Her chopsticks slowed, and her munching turned into tiny nibbles. Eventually, she couldn’t hold back her curiosity and asked.</p>
<p>“Do you have something to say?”</p>
<p>“…Something to say?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>I did have something I wanted to say.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask what she would do if she found out that Yi Yeonjun, the man she trusted the most, was someone who messed with her life.</p>
<p>“…Boss.”</p>
<p>And I wanted to know what she would think if I killed that man.</p>
<p>“It’s just an if, but….”</p>
<p>I tried to be indirect.</p>
<p>“What would you do if the person you trust the most disappointed you?”</p>
<p>This question was meant to have two meanings. One was Boss finding out about the real Yi Yeonjun. The other was her finding out that I betrayed her by killing him.</p>
<p>“…Disappoint?”</p>
<p>Boss’s expression turned cold. Seemingly having lost her appetite, she put down her chopsticks and stared at me.</p>
<p>“Mm… I don’t think you will ever disappoint me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so I’m the person you trust the most?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Boss’s frozen expression softened. She coughed in embarrassment and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Did something happen? Why are you asking me that?”</p>
<p>“…No reason.”</p>
<p>I thought carefully about what to do. If I told Boss the truth about Yi Yeonjun… she would probably try to kill him herself. And if she did, she might be struck with sadness, regret, and anger.</p>
<p>“I was just curious.”</p>
<p>This was my duty anyway. Telling Boss the truth could wait until I killed Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“I asked because I like you. That’s the sincere truth.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p><em>Crack!</em> At that moment, the chopsticks in Boss’s hand snapped in half. She stared at me, with her shaking hands holding the chopsticks. Her eyes widened like a cartoon character.</p>
<p>“W-W-What are you s-saying. I-It’s obvious that a subordinate should l-like his boss… I’m leaving. Kuhum! Kuhum!”</p>
<p>Boss got up in a fluster and scurried away to her room, leaving behind the food she liked on the table.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-5]</p>
<p>Five days remained until the Transnational Peace Conference.</p>
<p>In a magic practice area inside the Secret Service Institute, Harin was teaching us how to hunt a devil.</p>
<p>“I am from a clan of exorcists.”</p>
<p>Harin released her magic power to demonstrate exorcism. Her magic power bloomed with a clear, red hue. This color represented the exorcist power that critically wounded ‘evil’ beings.</p>
<p>“As I explained before, a clan is determined by ‘bloodline’. When members of our clan hunt devils, we mix our magic power with our blood. Follow after me.”</p>
<p>We took out blood packs that Harin made with the help of Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Borrowing the power of exorcism was surprisingly simple. We just had to imbue our magic power into the blood pack and let the two mix.</p>
<p>Kim Horak and Yi Yeonghan had trouble with this process, but Yun Seung-Ah, Rachel, and Aileen easily accomplished it.</p>
<p>“My magic power will mix with this blood and become an exorcising magic power.”</p>
<p>Aileen just had to say a single sentence. It was the same for me, as I just had to command Stigma’s magic power. It was then.</p>
<p>[Blood of the Devil Hunter Clan partially assimilates into you.]</p>
<p>[Your Authority, ‘Devil Hunter’, becomes stronger!]</p>
<p>[Partial Devilization – Devil’s Arm becomes stronger!]</p>
<p>[An incredible luck erupts! By absorbing the power of an exorcist’s blood, you received a part of their genes!]</p>
<p>[You obtained a new Gift, ‘True Exorcism’! An auspicious event may happen with an astronomically low chance!]</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>A series of system alerts popped up in front of me. I blinked my eyes and stared at the windows. While I was standing in a daze, Aileen talked to Harin.</p>
<p>“By the way, don’t we have to tell Kim Suho about this?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I will go to Sword Commander and teach him later.”</p>
<p>“Ah, okay.”</p>
<p>“Then, next!”</p>
<p><em>Chak—</em> Harin clapped her hands. The loud noise woke me up, and I turned my attention to her.</p>
<p>“Let’s start learning exorcism!”</p>
<p>But Harin’s words didn’t enter my head. For some reason, I felt like I obtained a huge hint.</p>
<p>Harin’s blood and Stigma’s magic power that assimilated with it.</p>
<p>My Authority, ‘Devil Hunter’, which was strengthened as a result.</p>
<p>“Um, Yurin-ssi?”</p>
<p>As I called Harin… <em>Bzzzz—</em> The crystal ball in my pocket suddenly vibrated.</p>
<p>“Kuhum, please turn off your crystal ball during lessons.”</p>
<p>Harin glared at me.</p>
<p>“…Ah, sorry.”</p>
<p>I took out the crystal ball with a wry smile. It was the one I received from Jin Sahyuk when I went to Arunheim.</p>
<p>“Hold on a minute.”</p>
<p>I left the area and picked up the call.</p>
<p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>When I whispered, Jin Sahyuk said something strange.</p>
<p>—It’s important. There are things we need to settle and things we need to confirm, so come meet me at 1 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<p>—Don’t be late, and don’t even think about not showing up.</p>
<p><em>Tk—</em></p>
<p>“…The hell?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk hung up without even waiting for my reply. I furrowed my brows and glared at the crystal ball.</p>
<p>“Hajin-ssi, what are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Hajin, you’re the one who said we didn’t have much time.”</p>
<p>Rachel and Yun Seung-Ah voiced their complaints.</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, I had something to take care of.”</p>
<p>I scratched my head and ran back to them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 332. One Step (1)</p>
<p>“My blood reacts when it is exposed to demonic energy. I guess you can say it boils.”</p>
<p>In the Secret Service Institute’s training room that Shimurin constructed with the help of Seraine’s funding, I was listening to Harin’s explanation.</p>
<p>“When my blood mixes with magic power, it transforms into a new power. My clan calls it Exorcism. Although it’s incredibly effective against demons, it cannot be used at all against those who aren’t.”</p>
<p>“Mm.”</p>
<p>Listening to her explanation, I looked at the Gift I obtained through luck.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[True Exorcism]</p>
<p>—Blood of an Exorcist</p>
<p>*Increases all variable stats by 1~100% when facing demonic beings. The stat increase is proportional to the power of the demonic being.</p>
<p>—Abyss</p>
<p>*Strengthens Partial Devilization</p>
<p>—Exorcism</p>
<p>*Connects with your Authority, ‘Devil Hunter’, and greatly ignores the demonic energy of demons.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>As I was slowly reading through the Gift’s description, the training room door burst open, and Yun Seung-Ah and Aileen barged in, fuming from their nostrils for some reason.</p>
<p>Harin and I stared at them in confusion.</p>
<p>“Argh, how annoying. Seung-Ah, are we allowed to be ignored like this?”</p>
<p>“…People just aren’t friendly to new faces.”</p>
<p>Aileen stomped the ground as soon as she walked in, and Yun Seung-Ah simply sighed.</p>
<p>“Those weak idiots… Arrrgh—!”</p>
<p>Aileen was on the verge of exploding, raising her hands in frustration. Seeing her like this, I asked in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>“…Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Ah, you guys are still here.”</p>
<p>Aileen quickly sizzled down. She scratched the back of her head in embarrassment before placing her hand on her hip and staring at us. She was clearly readying herself to vent her frustration.</p>
<p>“Listen, we went to the higher-ups because there were things we needed to do. But the employees there didn’t answer any of our questions and just ignored us. When we gave up and turned back to leave, they openly shit-talked us about how we got in through connections and whatnot….”</p>
<p>Aileen paused for a moment and grabbed the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>What happened to them made sense. They were equivalent to Korea’s grade-5 public officials, and it was perfectly clear that we got in through connections.</p>
<p>“Ah, my blood pressure…. I’m too old for this.”</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>A chuckle escaped my mouth. It felt strange seeing Aileen say that with her high schoolgirl-like appearance.</p>
<p>“Did you just laugh?”</p>
<p>Aileen immediately sent a death glare my way.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t….”</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>It was then that a knock saved me from a difficult situation. We simultaneously turned to the door, and Aileen opened it before I even mentioned it.</p>
<p>“Hello! …Oh? Aileen-ssi?!”</p>
<p>“…Ah?! Who are you guys?”</p>
<p>Beyond the door were Essence of the Strait’s Kim Youngjin, Yohei, Shen Yuan, Yi Jin-Ah, and some others who entered the Demon Realm Gate.</p>
<p>“Ooh, familiar faces!”</p>
<p>It seemed they entered the Secret Service as new members.</p>
<p>Aileen seemed to have found a new toy to play with as she greeted them with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“Welcome, my juniors~!”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>1 a.m., a time when the stars illuminated the sky’s dense darkness.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin came out to the Republic’s nameless forest, alone. Jin Sahyuk had chosen this secluded place, but it actually seemed to be a trail for walks, as long benches were placed around the forest here and there.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin sat down on a bench and looked up at the sky. The full moon radiated cold light, and stars surrounded it as if to protect it. He couldn’t help but gaze at this beautiful scene.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Just like that, he looked at the calm scenery in a daze. After about ten minutes…</p>
<p>“I thought you’d be late.”</p>
<p>A woman’s voice rang out from the darkness.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin turned his head sideways, where Jin Sahyuk was trudging out of the darkness.</p>
<p>Her long hair was tied in a ponytail, and she was full of confidence as always.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin asked without even the slightest change in his expression.</p>
<p>“…Why’d you ask me to come?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stopped in front of Kim Hajin’s bench. Naturally, she ended up looking down on him.</p>
<p>“There’s something I need to ask one last time.”</p>
<p>“…Last?”</p>
<p>Last… The strange connotation of the word raised Kim Hajin’s eyebrows.</p>
<p>“That’s right. This is the last time I’ll be seeing your ugly face.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk retorted nonchalantly and sat down on the bench.</p>
<p>“…Ku, Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Despite acting so imposing, Jin Sahyuk found that she was at a loss for words when she sat down.</p>
<p>Rather, she didn’t know how to start a conversation. When she was a king, she had always been straightforward with her words. That was the only way she knew to talk.</p>
<p>That had not changed even now.</p>
<p>“It’s about Kindspring.”</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin smirked from the abrupt skip to the chase. Jin Sahyuk stole side-glances at him and continued her question.</p>
<p>“What is your relationship with Kind—”</p>
<p>“I don’t know either.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin didn’t want to talk about Kim Chundong. To explain everything, he would need to accept once again that this world was a novel he wrote.</p>
<p>But this world wasn’t a novel but a true, real world.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin chuckled and turned to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details. I came here from another world, just like you, and Kim Chundong… went to your world and became Kindspring. That’s it.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk received Kim Hajin’s gaze with a stern expression.</p>
<p>“I already know everything, so don’t try to hide anything. Bell looked into your memories—”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t tell you even if I knew.”</p>
<p>“What did you say, you bastard?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk frowned. Kim Hajin simply shrugged his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I won’t tell you. No matter what.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was dumbfounded, but it really didn’t look like Kim Hajin would spill anything, especially about Kindspring and ‘Synchronization’.</p>
<p>After all, what idiot would reveal his weakness openly?</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>With no other choice, Jin Sahyuk heaved out a sigh. She then got up from the bench and shot a look at Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“I called you here for nothing then.”</p>
<p>“…That was it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you piece of shit.”</p>
<p>Disappointed, Jin Sahyuk was about to take her leave, when she suddenly grew angry and turned back.</p>
<p>“Oi, we won’t meet again after this, so wanna fight me one last time?”</p>
<p>“Fight?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked for a fight, and Kim Hajin got up without a moment of hesitation. Jin Sahyuk immediately flinched, albeit slightly. She didn’t expect Kim Hajin to fall for such an obvious provocation. Did he have a lot of pent-up stress?</p>
<p>“W-W-What? You’re down? F-Fine, come at me.”</p>
<p>Unlike Jin Sahyuk, who was brandishing her arms and legs clamorously, Kim Hajin simply raised his hand and…</p>
<p><em>Tak—</em>.</p>
<p>…gently placed it on Jin Sahyuk’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Why would we? We’re friends now, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk could feel warmth and sincerity from the smile on Kim Hajin’s face.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>In that instant, Jin Sahyuk’s mind turned blank, and she blinked her eyes in a daze. Her vision seemed to blur as if a hammer had struck her head.</p>
<p>“I’m leaving then. See you again.”</p>
<p>But Kim Hajin didn’t give her much time to recover, walking past her like the fleeting wind.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stood frozen. She simply waited until Kim Hajin’s footsteps got farther away.</p>
<p>The word ‘friend’ shocked her.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had never heard this word until now. She never even considered the possibility that she had a friend. After all, a king didn’t have any friends….</p>
<p><em>Shoooo—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, magic power condensed on the bench Kim Hajin was sitting on. The magic power swirled together and formed the shape of a human being. Jin Sahyuk knew who it was without having to wait.</p>
<p>“…You came to like him?”</p>
<p>The figure’s voice awakened Jin Sahyuk’s mind.</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth, you damned—”</p>
<p>“What, didn’t you say you were going to bring him to Akatrina? You just let him go! I told you how to switch Kim Hajin with Kindspring.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Bell’s words made Jin Sahyuk speechless. Just like he said, Jin Sahyuk planned to bring Kim Hajin to Akatrina, even if she had to forcefully abduct him.</p>
<p>That was, until she heard the word ‘friend’.</p>
<p>“He…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk scratched her head and spat out an excuse.</p>
<p>“He made me remember the past.”</p>
<p>Of the many memories she had with Kim Hajin, she recalled the Recorded Past, where she saw her younger self, Prihi, interact with Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>In the Recorded Past, Prihi and Kim Hajin were close. Prihi learned many things from Kim Hajin, relied on him, and even declared that she would one day ‘become like him’.</p>
<p>There was no problem calling Prihi and Kim Hajin ‘friends’.</p>
<p>‘…If, if I also met someone like Kim Hajin when I was young…’ Jin Sahyuk pondered.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t care either way. I just don’t want you to be lonely, and you’re going to be lonely without me.” Bell added playfully.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glared at him and shot back, “I don’t need you. Shut the hell up.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Bell gave a bright smile and turned into a wisp of magic power.</p>
<p>“I’ll go on ahead. Don’t be late~”</p>
<p>“I’m not going back today, retard.”</p>
<p><em>Shoooo—</em> Bell flew away with the wind. Left alone, Jin Sahyuk plopped down on the bench and looked up at the night sky.</p>
<p>The same sky Kim Hajin was just looking at entered her sight. The lone full moon shone in the dense darkness, but it didn’t look lonely thanks to all the stars surrounding it.</p>
<p>“I….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered slowly as she gazed into this sky.</p>
<p>“I’m used to being alone.”</p>
<p>The words she muttered to herself disappeared into the cold air without reaching Bell or Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference D-1]</p>
<p>One day before the Transnational Peace Conference, 11:40 p.m.</p>
<p>Everyone from the Secret Service made our way to the Leores Plaza. Citizens from all over the world were gathered to spectate the opening ceremony that would soon take place.</p>
<p>We began to survey the area for any potential threats.</p>
<p>“I don’t see anyone suspicious but stay on your toes.”</p>
<p>I looked down at the plaza from the watchtower and communicated with the rest of the Secret Service.</p>
<p>—Got it.</p>
<p>—Okay~ Tell us if anything happens.</p>
<p>Members of the Secret Service answered from all across the plaza. They were waiting with their senses heightened to detect any surge of demonic energy.</p>
<p>It was then. <em>Tap, tap-</em> The sound of footsteps rang out from the staircase to the watchtower.</p>
<p>I put the crystal ball in my hand down and turned back.</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>A familiar voice rang out. The unexpected guest was Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Here you are.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked around the watchtower with her arms crossed. I could tell that the dusty junk at the corner bothered her quite a bit.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here, Miss CEO? Aren’t you busy running your business?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Yoo Yeonha furrowed her brows and walked closer to me.</p>
<p>“It will be the day of the Transnational Peace Conference in less than 20 minutes. Ah, I’m sure you know this already, but the Transnational Peace Conference is a 2-week event. The first ten days are no different from a festival, and the real conference is on the last four days. Unfortunately, we don’t know when Baal will descend.”</p>
<p>“He’ll try to descend on the last day, if possible.”</p>
<p>I answered with certainty. From what Jin Sahyuk told me, Baal would wait until the end of the event to make his move.</p>
<p>“…I see. I trust you.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded her head without asking more questions.</p>
<p>The amount of trust she had in me was hard to come to terms with. I smiled at her, trying to appear cool, and asked my own question.</p>
<p>“Did you finish your preparation?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I gave each member of the Secret Service an exorcism weapon. We’ll have to wait to find out how effective they will be though…. Oh right, this is yours.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha held up the long, wooden case in her right hand.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“A bow. We couldn’t buy it even with the Republic’s treasury, so we stole it.”</p>
<p>“…You stole it?”</p>
<p>For a second, I doubted my ears.</p>
<p>“Open it.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I tilted my head and opened the case.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em> Inside the screeching case was a wooden bow that looked completely ordinary on the outside.</p>
<p>“How is it?”</p>
<p>I couldn’t answer Yoo Yeonha’s question.</p>
<p>“…Whoa.”</p>
<p>An exclamation of shock left my mouth.</p>
<p>Until now, I never imagined that there would be a bow surpassing the Black Lotus Bow, the synthesized result of Temujin’s Bow and Horus’s Bow.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Ancient Hero Leoricus’s Exorcism Bow] [Pinnacle-grade] [Legendary Artifact]</p>
<p>—The bow used by Hero Leoricus to combat devils.</p>
<p>—Contains several legacies of Leoricus’s exorcist power.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>But now, I had a ‘legendary’ pinnacle-grade bow. This Leoricus had to be on the same level of fame that Yi Sunshin had in Korea.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing.”</p>
<p>Hearing me murmur in a daze, Yoo Yeonha smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“But you have to return safely and give it back, okay? There’s a fake replica in the museum now.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Uh….”</p>
<p>‘I don’t know if I can return this…. If I fuse this bow with the Black Lotus Bow, I can’t begin to imagine what the result will be….’</p>
<p>“S-Sure, I’ll return it safely.”</p>
<p>But I nodded my head anyway.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>—The Transnational Peace Conference starts now!</p>
<p>Midnight seemed to have struck, as fireworks went off with a loud announcement.</p>
<p>Both Yoo Yeonha and I turned to the fireworks.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t focus on the scenery, as I was forced to stare at the series of messages popping up in front of me.</p>
<p>[The final episode, Daybreak, begins.]</p>
<p>[You are now only a single step away from the end.]</p>
<p>[Remember. You have the right to ask me a question or request something from me.]</p>
<p>Looking at the messages, I closed my eyes. I focused on the sound of exploding fireworks and the cheering of the people. Suddenly, my heart turned cold, and a thought surfaced in my mind.</p>
<p>“…No matter how this episode ends…”</p>
<p>I sent a message to the co-author.</p>
<p>“Let’s butt heads once everything’s over.”</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha thought I was talking to her and tilted her head curiously.</p>
<p>“Huh? Butt our heads?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>I laughed, and Yoo Yeonha pouted like a kid.</p>
<p>Then, to my surprise, the co-author messaged back.</p>
<p>[Understood.]</p>
<p>[Whether Baal dies or you die]</p>
<p>[Once this episode is over]</p>
<p>[I will invite you.]</p>
<p>[Then, I wish you the best of luck.]</p>
<p>I now had another reason I absolutely had to win.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 333. One Step (2)</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and Shin Jonghak arrived at the Republic to attend the Transnational Peace Conference.</p>
<p>They traveled by carriage. The place where they would stay for the next 2 weeks was the mansion of the well-known billionaire ‘Larin’. He had formally invited them to his home, as Shin Jonghak came from a respectable family by the name of ‘Priton’.</p>
<p>“Mm….”</p>
<p>This grand mansion was located in the capital city of Leores, where the price of land was extremely high.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty big. I’d say it’s about the size of my room.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s assessment of the mansion, however, was rather brutal. She was born and raised in Chae Joochul’s hanok, so it was only natural that she regarded this mansion mundane.</p>
<p>“Nothing really stands out….”</p>
<p>Her gaze roamed across the room and landed on Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“…Dude. What’re you doing?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak was reading a small notebook. When Chae Nayun called him, he raised his head and turned to her.</p>
<p>“I’m looking at the list of guests.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“There are other people staying in this mansion besides us. Airun, Draven…. Apparently, they’re all famous nobles in the Kingdom. I figured I should at least have their names memorized.”</p>
<p>“…Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun didn’t care much about networking, so she went out to the balcony. Her whole body ached, presumably because she’d been inside a carriage all day.</p>
<p>“…Hmmm.”</p>
<p>She leaned against the balustrade and gazed into the distance. Her eyes captured the view of the street below. The scenery, which was just the right combination of the past and the present, appeared quite mysterious.</p>
<p>“Mm…?”</p>
<p>As Chae Nayun continued to watch the busy street, an upside down face of a woman appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She stared at the face for 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds….</p>
<p>“…Fuuuck!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun yelled in surprise, fell backward and rolled into the room.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>The woman who appeared like a ghost, Jin Sahyuk, walked into the room with a proud laugh.</p>
<p>“D-Dammit. You asshole, why’d you do that for—?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun flew at Jin Sahyuk like an angry bull, but Jin Sahyuk stopped her with chains of magic power.</p>
<p>“Argh! These chains again?!”</p>
<p>“Shh. I need to tell you something, so listen up. You too, Shin Jonghak.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s voice sounded somewhat forlorn.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[The Republic of Leores — The first day of the Transnational Peace Conference]</p>
<p>Late night.</p>
<p>I had fallen asleep on the watchtower but suddenly woke up.</p>
<p>—Are you watching me?</p>
<p>It was because of the voice that was flowing into my ears.</p>
<p>At first, I thought Chae Nayun was trying to reach me.</p>
<p>—Answer if you’re watching me.</p>
<p>But this voice undoubtedly belonged to a man. It was also full of animosity and murderous intent.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>—Some nerve you have to follow me like this.</p>
<p>“What… ah.”</p>
<p>Only then did I realize what was happening. I shared my vision with the Observer.</p>
<p>—It looks like you can see me now.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was right in front of me. With the Observer in his hand, he glared at me with his dark eyes.</p>
<p>—Answer me.</p>
<p>“…How did you find out?” I asked.</p>
<p>The Observer delivered my question to Yi Yeonjun, who promptly scoffed.</p>
<p>—Did you really think that your cheap trick would work against me?</p>
<p>“Mm…. So what?”</p>
<p>—…What?</p>
<p>I tried to stay as calm as possible.</p>
<p>“This might actually be better. Why don’t we meet up right now? It’s pretty clear that we dislike each other.”</p>
<p>Now that I had access to my Gifts and weapons, I was confident that I could defeat Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>—…Haha.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun only laughed. Was he scared? Or was he making fun of my boldness?</p>
<p>—Fine. See you in four days.</p>
<p>The latter seemed to be the case. He nodded in satisfaction and announced the date.</p>
<p>“And the location?”</p>
<p>—I’ll notify you through this bird when the time comes. I’ll be keeping it with me until then.</p>
<p>“…Go ahead.”</p>
<p>—I will.</p>
<p>Immediately, the vision of the Observer darkened and Yi Yeonjun’s voice stopped as well.</p>
<p>“…Tsk. All this right after I wake up?”</p>
<p>I swept my hair and sighed. I hadn’t expected my Observer to get caught. Thankfully, I managed to play it cool….</p>
<p>“Hajin-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Uaaak!”</p>
<p>I jumped 5 meters into the air.</p>
<p>“Woah!”</p>
<p>Rachel also threw her hands in the air out of surprise.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After the moment of surprise, we stared at each other awkwardly before I finally let out a dry cough.</p>
<p>“W-When did you get here, R-Rachel-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Ah, it’s nothing important. It’s just that, Hajin-ssi….”</p>
<p>But we didn’t get to hold a conversation.</p>
<p>—Emergency, emergency! This is Yi Younghan! Several demons have infiltrated this place! We need help!</p>
<p>The crystal vibrated wildly, crying for backup.</p>
<p>Rachel and I jumped through the window of the watchtower at the same time. The watchtower was 130 meters tall but shrouded in magic power, we had nothing to fear.</p>
<p><em>KOOOONG—!</em></p>
<p>After the landing we darted forward, enduring the soreness in our calves.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Five minutes later.</p>
<p>We arrived at the location where Yi Younghan had sent the backup request.</p>
<p>It was the capital’s underground sewer system.</p>
<p>Surrounded in darkness and humidity, Kim Horak and Yi Younghan were fighting dozens of demons.</p>
<p>“What happened here?” I asked.</p>
<p>Kim Horak answered, “We’re not sure. We followed the trail of demonic energy and found them here.”</p>
<p>Kim Horak had started addressing me more politely after our first meeting. I didn’t know why. Apparently, he just felt like it.</p>
<p>“They look fairly strong. Will the four of us be enough?” Yi Younghan muttered worriedly. He wiped the sweat off his forehead and grabbed his gauntlet.</p>
<p>“Well….”</p>
<p>I scanned the demons and tried to guess.</p>
<p>[A total of 24 demons awaken your instinct.]</p>
<p>[In the face of huge demonic presences, all your variable stats have increased by 49%.]</p>
<p>Increased by 49%.</p>
<p>“I think we can pull it off.”</p>
<p>The situation wasn’t as bad as it seemed.</p>
<p>“Uhahaha—!”</p>
<p>At that moment, the sound of hearty laughter resonated across the sewer.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap—</em></p>
<p>A demon who looked like a mummy came forward.</p>
<p>“You make me laugh, human.”</p>
<p>Saying so, the demon gathered demonic energy in his hand. The other demons did the same, gathering demonic energy in their hands, mouths, and chests.</p>
<p>Soon, stifling demonic energy filled the entire sewer.</p>
<p>“You strive to work together to defeat us, but it’s no use. You won’t stand a chance against the Duke of Hell!”</p>
<p>The demon shot condensed demonic energy towards me.</p>
<p>“Return to dust, human…?”</p>
<p>The energy flew at me in the shape of a boomerang, and I easily grabbed it with my hand.</p>
<p>[‘Exorcism’ has been activated. The power of demonic energy has been reduced by 90%.]</p>
<p>[The amount of reduction is affected by your luck.]</p>
<p>“I see you have a trick up your sleeve, human.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Oh no, this isn’t-”</p>
<p>“Kill him!”</p>
<p>The demon who seemed to be the leader shouted, and this time all of the demons released their demonic energy at the same time.</p>
<p>The energy waves from 23 different demons merged into one as they flew straight towards me. I held out my hand.</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAAA—!</em></p>
<p>The explosion of demonic energy shook the earth.</p>
<p>All the water in the sewer evaporated. The atmosphere heated up and poisonous gas began to fill the air. The energy wrecked everything surrounding it and swallowed me whole….</p>
<p>“Kuhahaha…?”</p>
<p>The demon laughed again.</p>
<p>But his laughter stopped midway.</p>
<p>It was only natural because even after being struck by the enormous mass of demonic energy, I was standing still, completely intact.</p>
<p>“…Huhu. This….”</p>
<p>With a smile, I checked the system window.</p>
<p>[Gift Exorcism has been activated. The power of demonic energy has been reduced by 95%.]</p>
<p>“…doesn’t hurt at all.”</p>
<p>An astounding 95%.</p>
<p>“…What did you say, human?”</p>
<p>“Well well, it seems that,” I continued cheerfully, ”You won’t be able to lay a finger on me.”</p>
<p>I was more suited to fighting demons than anyone else.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Earth - Tower of Heroes]</p>
<p>—Rank 3 Vassago, Rank 14 Leraje, Rank 29 Astaroth, Rank 62 Valac. So far, we were able to identify these four devils.</p>
<p>An emergency meeting was taking place at the Tower of Heroes located in Gwanghwamun, Korea. Demon Realm Transformation, which humans thought they had successfully put off, was beginning to spread again due to the appearance of devils with incarnation bodies.</p>
<p>—Valac and Astaroth are the more aggressive of the four.</p>
<p>The organizer of today’s meeting was Yi Gongmyung who had brilliantly led the Orden Annihilation Mission not so long ago.</p>
<p>“Then…”</p>
<p>The audience was comprised of Heynckes the Lord of Steel, Chae Joochul the Immortal, and the Association’s chairmen, Yi Yookho and Kim Sukho.</p>
<p>All four participants had great influence over the Association.</p>
<p>“Does that mean the other two aren’t aggressive?”</p>
<p>—Vassago and Leraje aren’t.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung answered Heynckes.</p>
<p>—I’m not sure whether they’re building up power or simply not interested in fighting. I’ve only heard rumors about them. But we do know for certain that they’re not involved in Demon Realm Transformation currently.</p>
<p>“Rumors?” Kim Sukho asked with a frown, “What kind of rumors?”</p>
<p>—These are the rumors regarding the devils.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung immediately pulled up the slide about the rumors as if he had been expecting Kim Sukho’s question.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Season 5 Gladiator of the Century Official Ranking]</p>
<p>1. Lijengyi — 393 official matches, 391 wins and 2 draws</p>
<p>2. SpamMachine — 584 official matches, 404 wins, 170 losses and 10 draws</p>
<p>3. …</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Gladiator of the Century?”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho rubbed his temple in confusion.</p>
<p>—This user right here who goes by the username Lijengyi is rumored to be Leraje.</p>
<p>“…Oi, Yi Gongmyung. Are you trying to be funny?”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho raised his voice, but Yi Gongmyung remained calm.</p>
<p>—That was my initial reaction as well. But I contacted the capsule developers and investigated Lijengyi’s account. And the result-</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung changed the screen again. This time, it showed a record of all the games Lijengyi had ever played and the amount of time she had spent playing each game.</p>
<p>Not just Gladiator of the Century but also Grand Theft Auto, Three Kingdoms, Become a Legend, etc… Lijengyi had spent a total of 4000 hours playing different games.</p>
<p>—An astounding 4000 hours. If we take into account the date her account was created, this means that she’s been playing games almost nonstop ever since.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho let out a dumbfounded laugh.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to say that this devil is a game addict?”</p>
<p>—Yes, at least according to the rumors.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung nodded slightly and changed the screen.</p>
<p>—While Leraje is busy playing games, Valac, the most aggressive of all, is….</p>
<p>The video showed the part of the Sahara that had been completely transformed into the Demon Realm.</p>
<p>In it, monsters were moving in an orderly fashion under Valac’s command.</p>
<p>—As you can see, Vakac is creating an army.</p>
<p>“…So it seems.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>At that moment, Chae Joochul, who had been quiet all along, opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“I heard there’s a remarkable summon magician in England.”</p>
<p>His comment didn’t seem at all related to the contents of the meeting. His voice was as emotionless as always.</p>
<p>—Yes, that is correct.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung answered, not shaken by the sudden change of subject.</p>
<p>—She’s Lady Ah Hae-In’s pupil.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho frowned.</p>
<p>“Ah Hae-In?”</p>
<p>—Yes. However, because Lady Ah Hae-In was very secretive, I couldn’t find out the details.</p>
<p>“…Good. Let’s not meddle with Ah Hae-In.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho let out a dry cough and lowered his head. The position of a 9-star magician was simply too great. The Association could probably handle one 9-star magician; what they really feared was the opposition from other magicians that revered 9-star magicians.</p>
<p>—I understand. And, this is my last report for the day. A strange phenomenon occurred last week at a beach in Vladivostok.</p>
<p>The long meeting was finally coming to an end.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung showed the security footage of Vladivostok from 3 days ago.</p>
<p>—Please take a look.</p>
<p>All four VIPs turned to the screen.</p>
<p>…The word ‘strange’ well suited the 5-second-long footage.</p>
<p>“What was that? I didn’t get a clear look.”</p>
<p>Even Chae Joochul and Heynckes, who had been sitting comfortably until now, leaned forward. Yi Gongmyung played the footage one more time.</p>
<p>…Chwaaaa..</p>
<p>What happened was fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>A number of monsters appeared off the shore of Vladivostok. Suddenly a gust of wind raved across the sea and all the monsters were dead.</p>
<p>That was all there was.</p>
<p>“Can’t you play it more slowly?”</p>
<p>Heynckes seemed quite perplexed as well.</p>
<p>It was quite obvious that this wind was not a natural phenomenon, but because it had moved so fast, he couldn’t identify its source.</p>
<p>—It has already been slowed down to the limit. The Russian Government handled the remains of the monsters. They said that the bodies were cut by something sharp.</p>
<p>“…Is this also the work of the devils?” Heynckes asked.</p>
<p>—Nothing is for certain, but… I don’t believe the Devils were involved in this.</p>
<p>“And what’s your reason?”</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung nodded and continued.</p>
<p>—We took a look at the flow of magic power in Vladivostok and its vicinity and discovered the pulsation of a certain type of magic power. We found this pulsation familiar.</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho interrupted Yi Gongmyung and waved his hand impatiently.</p>
<p>“If it’s not the devils, then what is it?”</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung fell silent for the first time today.</p>
<p>He looked at Kim Sukho, then Chae Joochul, then Heynckes, then Yi Yukho, and….</p>
<p>—I believe it’s…</p>
<p>He uttered a name that didn’t belong to any devil.</p>
<p>His declaration startled even the Immortal.</p>
<p>—‘Orden’.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 334. One Step (3)</p>
<p>Ever since the rampant activities of demons 10 years ago, the position of the Republic’s Anti-Demon Bureau rose to the top. Its mission was ‘to purify the demonic’, and its members took pride in subjugating demons and demonic monsters.</p>
<p>Today, a rather troublesome guest visited them.</p>
<p>Airun, the famous knight and commander of Arunheim, wished to meet the Anti-Demon Bureau’s Deputy Director Seraine, and Seraine agreed after much thought.</p>
<p>“One wrong step and the matter might have become an international issue.”</p>
<p>Airun said as she walked through the Bureau’s hallway with Seraine.</p>
<p>“Issue? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Seraine tilted her head, pretending to be oblivious. Airun’s brows went up sharply.</p>
<p>“…I’m talking about the F-rank sharpshooter, Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>“Uh… Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Seraine blinked her eyes as if she was racking her head to remember the name.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin… who was that again…? Mm….”</p>
<p>However, she only mumbled confusedly, and Airun bit her lips in response.</p>
<p>“He recently made headlines in the Republic’s newspapers.”</p>
<p>“Ah~!”</p>
<p>Seraine clapped her hands with a straight face. She recalled seeing the headline, [F-rank Sharpshooter Kim Hajin]. Although she did her best to suppress the news from spreading, she couldn’t stop the rumors from spreading.</p>
<p>“I see what you mean now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, so where is he? He should return to the army now that he’s done with his mission.”</p>
<p>“Who knows? I’ve seen his name in the news, but that’s all I know… Ah, I heard it was a misreport. I mean, how could an F-rank sharpshooter decimate demonic monsters?”</p>
<p>Airun glared at Seraine, who was scratching her cheek innocently.</p>
<p>“…So you’re saying you don’t know?”</p>
<p>“No, but I’m sure he went back to his home country.”</p>
<p>“No, he didn’t come ba… huu.”</p>
<p>Airun was troubled. She was certain that Kim Hajin safely escorted Harin to the Republic, but she couldn’t dig into the matter any deeper. If she did, the Kingdom might find out that she was the one who helped Harin escape. Even Airun was afraid of punishment from the Arunheim’s tyrannical ruler.</p>
<p>“From what I hear, the Republic established a new institute called the Secret Service.”</p>
<p>Without any other choice, Airun changed the subject. She suspected that Kim Hajin also had something to do with the Secret Service, but there was nothing she could do to confirm her suspicions.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say it’s a new institute. We simply reinstated an old agency for the Transnational Peace Conference.”</p>
<p>The subject must have made Seraine nervous as her voice trembled slightly.</p>
<p>“I see… The director’s name was Heiji, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, we were lucky enough to pick up an excellent talent. We promoted him to the position of director to put a tight leash on him.”</p>
<p>“Picked up, you say….”</p>
<p>Airun stopped. Seraine also halted and turned her gaze to Airun.</p>
<p>“Are you sure he didn’t walk in himself?”</p>
<p>Airun wasn’t looking to take Kim Hajin back. She simply wanted to meet with him and make sure he wouldn’t tell anyone about his escort mission. After all, Airun’s position was at stake.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Seraine didn’t answer. Instead, a condescending smirk escaped her mouth. She found it funny that Airun, who was known as the paragon of knights, lived in fear for her life in her own country.</p>
<p>“Well, maybe he did.”</p>
<p>—Demon invasion! Demon invasion!</p>
<p>Just as Seraine was about to answer, an alert rang out from the speaker above their heads. Seraine and Airun both paused and looked at each other.</p>
<p>—25 demons appeared in the northeast sewage system of the capital!</p>
<p>25 demons. The moment they heard this number, they put their prodding on hold and dashed out of the Anti-Demon Bureau. The other members of the Anti-Demon Bureau followed them.</p>
<p>With magic power incorporated into their movements, the group moved like a flying hawk and arrived at their destination in just five minutes.</p>
<p>But when the 133-member group entered the sewage system, what greeted them was an entirely different sight than expected.</p>
<p>“…Hm? Oh, you’re finally here.”</p>
<p>25 demons were tied up with ropes, and some members of the Secret Service were sitting on their backs.</p>
<p>“A bit late, but I guess it’s fine.”</p>
<p>Seraine immediately recognized Kim Hajin, Kim Horak, Yi Yeonghan, and Rachel. The members of the Anti-Demon Bureau stood with dazed expressions as Kim Hajin smiled leisurely and gave them the demons.</p>
<p>“Take them.”</p>
<p>Hearing Kim Hajin, one woman was shocked speechless. She recognized the man’s face, but she couldn’t believe her eyes. After all, who would believe that an F-rank sharpshooter could defeat 25 demons?</p>
<p>“We’ll be taking our leave then.”</p>
<p>Airun didn’t know what to say. It seemed Kim Hajin hadn’t noticed her, as he left the sewage system with a relaxed smile.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Transnational Peace Conference, Day 5]</p>
<p>“The pride of the Republic… Director Heiji and his subordinates… subjugates 25 demons….”</p>
<p>The Secret Service received special treatment for their recent achievements. All personnel affiliated with the group received commendation from the President and were guaranteed a hefty reward. Naturally, the agency’s name became the talk of the city.</p>
<p>The fact that they subjugated ‘25’ demons was simply too amazing. Demons were well-known for their incredible individual strength, and the united force of all demons was said to be powerful enough to topple any nation in a few days.</p>
<p>In any case, I returned to the director’s office after being congratulated by the Republic’s citizens.</p>
<p>“Congrats.”</p>
<p>Boss came to visit me at the office. Well, she was intruding, technically speaking.</p>
<p>“Don’t tease me. By the way, how did you get in? I couldn’t sense you at all.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, good. My ability has been improving recently.”</p>
<p>Boss strutted with her chest out proudly. Then, she transformed into a shadow. Her body melted down, becoming a puddle of darkness on the ground. Her presence also disappeared completely.</p>
<p>“Wow, that’s impressive.”</p>
<p>—Huhu.</p>
<p>Boss laughed contently and transformed back. The way Boss shot up from her shadow was both amazing and creepy at the same time.</p>
<p>“So, what are you going to do next?” Boss asked.</p>
<p>I was about to answer her but suddenly thought of something funny and offered her my hand.</p>
<p>“Grab my hand.”</p>
<p>“H-Hand? Why?”</p>
<p>“Just take it.”</p>
<p>Boss grabbed my hand hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Now close your eyes.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p><em>Gulp—</em> I could hear her swallowing hard. Boss closed her eyes. Then, I shared our vision with Observer No.2, which I dispatched not too long ago.</p>
<p>The scenery from the heart of the capital appeared before our eyes.</p>
<p>Although the sun had already set, the capital was bustling with foreign tourists and domestic visitors. The Observer looked down at this scenery from the sky and spotted three people who stood out among the crowd.</p>
<p>—…Baal’s will will probably descend on the 13th.</p>
<p>It was Jin Sahyuk. She had a sweet chicken skewer in her hand.</p>
<p>—So we have 8 days then.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was also there. Boss squeezed my hand with hers when she spotted Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Chae Jinyoon’s sister and Chae Joochul’s granddaughter. Boss knew who she was.</p>
<p>—Prepare yourself until then. Don’t just eat like a pig.</p>
<p>—…You’re the one eating like a pig!</p>
<p>Chae Nayun growled and reached forward to grab the skewer in Jin Sahyuk’s hand. Jin Sahyuk easily blocked her, and Chae Nayun sighed with a frown.</p>
<p>—Aren’t you on that Bell guy’s side anyway? Why don’t you just convince him to stop Baal’s descent?</p>
<p>—That’s impossible.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shook her head resolutely.</p>
<p>—If left alone, Baal will tear Bell’s body apart and descend on his own on the 14th. That’s why Bell hastened the descent by a day… so that he can save himself through death.</p>
<p>With that final line, Jin Sahyuk chewed on the skewer. I turned to Boss.</p>
<p>“Hear that? Bell will die soon.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Boss squeezed my hand without replying. Boss no longer felt hatred towards Bell. She realized she didn’t need to now that she knew Bell never killed Yi Yeonjun. In fact, she felt sorry.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Her belated mumbling was cold and bitter.</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t much time left.</p>
<p>Arunheim and Leores’s ending.</p>
<p>Earth and this world’s ending.</p>
<p>And my own ending.</p>
<p>There really wasn’t much time… until then.</p>
<p>When that day came, what choices would I make?</p>
<p>What choices <em>should</em> I make?</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>I disconnected our vision with Observer No.2. When I opened my eyes, I could see Boss’s face. She still had her eyes closed, frowning from the Observer’s vision cutting off.</p>
<p>Her beauty was hard to describe with words, but there was one thing I always thought whenever I saw her cute, clumsy side.</p>
<p>‘I want to be with her for a lot longer.’</p>
<p>But at that moment, a voice flowed into my ears, as if to explicitly stop this train of thought.</p>
<p>—Come here tomorrow at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was talking to me through Observer No.1.</p>
<p>He was summoning me to a secluded alleyway somewhere in the Republic.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England – Chameleon Troupe’s Sanctuary]</p>
<p>When Pandemonium showed signs of being swallowed by Demon Realm Transformation, members of the Chameleon Troupe returned to their base in the underwater cave of the English Channel.</p>
<p>The underwater sanctuary was clean and well-kept thanks to Kim Hajin’s modifications. Each member unpacked their belongings in their rooms and gathered in the lobby.</p>
<p>“…Hah? Orden is alive? Are you positive?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong asked with a scowl on Kim Hajin’s handcrafted couch.</p>
<p>“Yep, that’s what Droon said. Interesting, right?”</p>
<p>Jin Yohan nodded his head as he took out a can of beer from the fridge.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong rubbed his chin and pondered. It was obvious what he was thinking about, and no one doubted that he was already shadow-boxing Orden in his mind.</p>
<p>Jin Yohan took out a sip of beer and changed the subject.</p>
<p>“So, what happened to the 9th floor?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that? It’s over. I personally took care of those calamities or whatever.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong answered with a grin. He clearly remembered his battles on the 9th floor. Legendary monsters from myths and legends became steppingstones for his growth, and he even got to spar with legends like Lancelot and Lü Bu.</p>
<p>“So what are we going to do now? Find and kill Orden again? Huhuhu.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong chuckled as he sunk into the couch.</p>
<p>“Ah, this couch is so comfy. Is it because Hajin made it?”</p>
<p>“That? Yeah, Kim Hajin made it… But that’s not the problem. Focus, Jungyeong. Shouldn’t we wait until Boss comes back? There are other things we need to take care of, like the matter with Vast Expanse.”</p>
<p>Jin Yohan crushed the beer can in his hand. Last week, Vast Expanse had come to visit them, wanting to meet Yi Yuri, the girl with the Authority of Healing.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, isn’t Droon going out with that girl now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they’re together, even now.”</p>
<p>“Haha, well that’s something.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong laughed like an old man and spread his arms out. Lying so peacefully in the couch, he suddenly remembered all the devils that had appeared recently.</p>
<p>Transcendental beings who supposedly descended to Earth using incarnation bodies… Cheok Jungyeong stared at the ceiling and murmured quietly.</p>
<p>“Oi, these devils… don’t you think we can take care of them?”</p>
<p>“…Why, do you want to fight them?”</p>
<p>“Kuhuhu, do you even need to ask?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong raised his hand and stared at it. The toughest hand in the world. Cheok Jungyeong firmly believed in his own strength.</p>
<p>“No matter what devil I encounter….”</p>
<p>With it, he had defeated Lü Bu, crushed Dullahan, and beat up Behemoth.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll be able to crush them.”</p>
<p>A confident smile bloomed on his face. ‘Purple’ magic power blazed up around his hand. He had obtained this violet magic power by eating Behemoth’s heart. With it, he believed his strength had reached a transcendent realm.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Yohan looked at him silently.</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>As someone who had seen both Heynckes and Chae Joochul, Jin Yohan couldn’t help but agree. The current Cheok Jungyeong didn’t look any weaker than Chae Joochul. In fact, Jin Yohan couldn’t imagine Cheok Jungyeong losing.</p>
<p>“It looks like you’ve become a monster too.”</p>
<p>Jin Yohan muttered an honest praise.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong smiled faintly. His violet magic power crackled around his hand and arm. The more he saw it, the more mesmerized he became by his new strength.</p>
<p>—Ignore everything else and just focus on conquering the 9th floor.</p>
<p>Just like always, what Kim Hajin told him turned out to be correct.</p>
<p>While Cheok Jungyeong was intoxicated by his own strength…</p>
<p><em>Beeeeep—! Beeeeeep—!</em></p>
<p>A loud siren went off in the sanctuary. To be exact, the sound came from the members’ smartwatches.</p>
<p>“Whoa!”</p>
<p>“Ah, geez, that surprised me.”</p>
<p>Kaita and Setryn woke up from their sleep, and Droon also came out of his room with Yi Yuri.</p>
<p>“What happened, Jin Yohan, Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Yohan calmly looked down at this smartwatch. After about a minute, he raised his head and faced Cheok Jungyeong. Cheok Jungyeong was also looking back at him.</p>
<p>Soon, a big smile emerged on his face.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>He asked with a voice full of anticipation. Jin Yohan projected the emergency alert.</p>
<p>[Emergency report! Rank 62 Devil, Valac, is marching north with his army!]</p>
<p>[Emergency report! Rank 29 Devil, Astaroth, appears in Spain!]</p>
<p>[Emergency report! Rank 14 Devil, Leraje, announces the creation of a Devil’s Castle. Its location is the former headquarters of the game company, Leol!]</p>
<p>[Emergency report! Rank 3 Devil, Vassago….]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 335. The Stories of Characters (1)</p>
<p>Rank 62 Devil Valac.</p>
<p>Rising from a desert, Valac’s army displayed overwhelming power as it marched through Central Asia to Europe. With parts of the land and ocean submerged by the Demon Realm, Europe didn’t have the power to repel the devil army.</p>
<p>Worldwide disaster warnings were issued, and Heroes of the Association were dispatched to Europe. A war had broken out between humanity and devils.</p>
<p>Rank 29 Devil Astaroth.</p>
<p>Astaroth put up a barrier in the middle of Spain’s Madrid. With no way of entering or exiting the barrier, humanity had no way of knowing what was happening inside.</p>
<p>While Valac was causing havoc in the east, Astaroth put Spain under complete lockdown. But Europe didn’t have the time to even complain about the injustice it was facing.</p>
<p>Rank 14 Devil Leraje.</p>
<p>Leraje, on the other hand, was far from Europe. She constructed a Devil’s Castle using the headquarters of the game company Leol, located in the United States’ state of California. Leraje’s Devil’s Castle acted as a Portal connected to the Demon Realm, and demons and demonic monsters flooded out like a tidal wave.</p>
<p>But Leraje didn’t cause destruction like Valac and Astaroth. In fact, she offered a rather strange mission to humanity, or to be exact, the game company Leol.</p>
<p>—Make me the most enjoyable game ever created. It would be nice if there were multiple classes to choose from.</p>
<p>Leraje’s order confused Leol’s CEO and developers, who were now entrapped inside the Devil’s Castle. But before their confusion could subside, Leraje added another goal.</p>
<p>—If the game you create can satisfy me and if somebody beats me in that game, I won’t cause any harm to humanity.</p>
<p>To their bewilderment, Leol had been handed the fate of America.</p>
<p>—I will swear on my name as a devil that I will keep this promise.</p>
<p>Leraje even made an oath that made the entire Americas turn their eyes towards Leol.</p>
<p>The 5,300 employees of Leol began their game development process from that day forward with the world’s expectations on their backs. Leraje had given them a deadline of 20 days. The laughably small timeframe would normally have made the mission impossible, but Leol coincidentally had been in the middle of developing a game. As they were confident it would be the greatest game of the modern era, they put even more time into speeding up its completion.</p>
<p>Rank 3 Devil Vassago.</p>
<p>Similar to Leraje, Vassago gave humanity a unique but less generous mission. He constructed a Colosseum in Pandemonium and invited the warriors of Earth.</p>
<p>—Come defeat me.</p>
<p>His message was simple, but not many people were strong enough to challenge him. Disgruntled with the lack of reaction, Vassago added that he would fight multiple challenges simultaneously. Seeing that even that was ineffective, he released an ultimatum that he would wait ten more days.</p>
<p>All in all, humanity came to realize the gravity of the danger they were facing. It was at this moment that a determined Master-rank Hero visited the Hero Association.</p>
<p>“I will challenge Vassago.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>She was originally planning on entering the Demon Realm Gate, but she changed her mind on the day of the Gate’s opening, when she heard that Chameleon Troupe’s Cheok Jungyeong was wreaking havoc on the Tower of Wish’s 9th floor. Jin Seyeon had too many things she wanted to talk about with the Chameleon Troupe, who had changed her life completely.</p>
<p>“…You?”</p>
<p>The Association Chairman, Yi Yookho, blinked his eyes in confusion. Jin Seyeon’s sudden visit had clearly caught him off guard.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon was determined, but Yi Yookho was hesitant. Jin Seyeon was too good of a card to waste on Vassago’s Colosseum. The Association was planning on using disposal Heroes to challenge Vassago and buy time.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to—”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. That man will be there too.”</p>
<p>“…That man?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon had failed to track down Cheok Jungyeong on the 9th floor, but she was positive that he would come to challenge the Colosseum. Perhaps, Black Lotus would be there as well.</p>
<p>“Chameleon Troupe’s Cheok Jungyeong… and perhaps Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yi Yookho sighed internally. Even at a glance, he could tell how determined Jin Seyeon was. Knowing the relationship between Jin Seyeon and the Chameleon Troupe, there wasn’t much he could say.</p>
<p>“I understand, but here’s what I think.”</p>
<p>Yi Yookho took out a secret document from his drawer to dissuade Jin Seyeon from challenging the Colosseum.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“You’ll know when you read it yourself, but I’ll explain it simply. There’s a chance that Orden is alive.”</p>
<p>“Orden?!”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon immediately scanned the document. Meanwhile, Yi Yookho continued explaining.</p>
<p>“The area around Russia’s Vladivostok has been free of demonic monsters for some time. Its surrounding areas have all undergone Demon Realm Transformation and are filled with demons and demonic monsters, but Vladivostok is spotless. If you visit the city, you’ll hear its residents laughing and living peacefully.”</p>
<p>The document contained accounts of Vladivostok’s residents. Apparently, a mysterious power annihilated demons and demonic monsters in the area. No one knew what the mysterious power was, but being sensitive to magic power, Yi Gongmyung was able to deduce the identity through the pulsation and smell of magic power.</p>
<p>“I want to entrust you with this task. It might be more important than the devils. Heynckes and Chae Joochul also agreed to participate.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon put down the document after giving it a thorough read. Her expression had not changed in the slightest, and Yi Yookho couldn’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>“I will stop Vassago. If two of the Nine Stars are participating, me not being there shouldn’t make much of a difference.”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>In the end, Yi Yookho scowled.</p>
<p>“Why are you so bent on pursuing the Chameleon Troupe? I told you before, the Kwang-Oh Incident is—”</p>
<p>“I’ll take my leave.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon got up from her seat. Although she knew she was being rude, she had no intention of hearing a made-up story about her past.</p>
<p>“…If you leave now, you will regret it.”</p>
<p>Yi Yookho’s expression stiffened. He tried to stop Jin Seyeon but knew he was powerless.</p>
<p>“I hope we meet again.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon bowed and left without hesitation.</p>
<p>“That stubborn woman… Earth is on the brink of destruction and all she cares about is some bygone past….”</p>
<p>Yi Yookho massaged his temples and turned on his smartwatch to report to Kim Sukho.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[3 AM, Republic of Leores]</p>
<p>The moonlit field of grass was the perfect place for a youthful couple to meet. Unfortunately, the person waiting for me was Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>I quickly spotted Yi Yeonjun in the distance, and he was staring back at me.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>He started with a simple greeting.</p>
<p>Before responding to him, I reminded myself to get him to talk as much as possible.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Lv.8 Unique Skill – Clockhand of Fate]</p>
<p>- Fate</p>
<p>—You can select up to 8 targets to be your ‘Fate’.</p>
<p>—For 3 minutes, when fighting your ‘Fate’, your variable stats and special stats increase by 300%. (Usable once every 120 hours).</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was because of this Unique Skill. When I chose Jin Sahyuk as my first target, talking to her a few times was enough. But I had a huge problem choosing a second target.</p>
<p>[Condition to select the second target – exchange at least 100 back-and-forths while talking to your target face-to-face.]</p>
<p>“…Did you hear me?”</p>
<p>Seeing that I was silent, Yi Yeonjun spoke again. His monotone voice made me question whether he was bored.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I heard a lot about you from Boss. My name is Kim Hajin. What’s yours?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun closed his mouth like I said something I shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>“…Hello?”</p>
<p>He didn’t react at all. Did he hear about my Unique Skill from Bell?</p>
<p>“Answer me. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>…I considered reversing time and starting over. But the side-effect of the 3-minute Time Reversal was too big. Even with the Orb of Regeneration, my movements would be severely restricted for at least 10 minutes. Yi Yeonjun didn’t strike me as the person to wait that long.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk told me what you’re planning.”</p>
<p>Since Yi Yeonjun seemed uninterested in talking, I continued myself. This time, I took a more direct approach and recited Yi Yeonjun’s plan.</p>
<p>“If Baal descends after Jin Sahyuk kills Bell, Baal would need a new incarnation body.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was aiming to take that role.</p>
<p>“You’re trying to become Baal’s incarnation body.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But Yi Yeonjun remained silent.</p>
<p>“…Hello?”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth.”</p>
<p>With those three words, Yi Yeonjun released his magic power. Contrary to his disposition, his magic power was white.</p>
<p>“Quite a foul-mouth, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I raised my gun, which was loaded with bullets tipped with the Basilisk’s venom. At the same time, I activated all the medicinal effects of my [Medicinal Memory Physique].</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>KOOOONG—!</em></p>
<p>A huge earthquake broke out that seemed to score at least 8 points on the Richter scale. With that as the signal, Yi Yeonjun kicked off the ground, fully unleashing his magic power.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa….</em></p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun’s white magic power spread out in all directions. As the brilliant light eliminated all shadows in the area, I activated Bullet Time.</p>
<p><em>Kirik— Kirik—</em></p>
<p>I could see Yi Yeonjun in slow-motion. Magic power shot out of his body like the branches of a tree. I heard from Jin Sahyuk that Yi Yeonjun could freely manipulate the temperature of magic power.</p>
<p>His Gift sounded simple, but I knew it had to be powerful given his status.</p>
<p>I transformed the Desert Eagle into its shotgun form and aimed it at him.</p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>The moment I pulled the trigger, the Desert Eagle spat out venomous buckshot like a dragon’s breath.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>KOOOONG—!</em></p>
<p>The ground suddenly rumbled. Jin Sahyuk’s eyes shot open. Her mind turned cold. Her intuition was telling her that the rumbling wasn’t from a simple earthquake.</p>
<p>“What, what happened!?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, who was sleeping on the couch, also woke up.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk jumped down from the window, and Chae Nayun and Shin Jonghak followed after her.</p>
<p>“Wait! Tell us what’s happening! Where are you going!?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk ignored Chae Nayun and ran straight to the epicenter of the earthquake. The streets of the Republic were in chaos from the earthquake.</p>
<p>Jumping from roof to roof, Jin Sahyuk rushed to Bell’s mansion.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>She broke the window and entered the dark mansion. Just as she was looking around the empty bedroom…</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>…A low-pitched sigh rang out from the corner. Jin Sahyuk turned her gaze and found Bell collapsed with his hands on his stomach.</p>
<p>“BELL!”</p>
<p>She yelled loudly but paused from embarrassment. While Jin Sahyuk was hesitating, Shin Jonghak and Chae Nayun also arrived.</p>
<p>When Shin Jonghak spotted Bell, he furrowed his brows. Meanwhile, Chae Nayun asked as she blinked her eyes in confusion.</p>
<p>“What, what happened to you!?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Bell got up with his body drenched in cold sweat.</p>
<p>“It just signaled to me. It wants to come out, even if it has to tear my body apart.”</p>
<p>“…Is it bad?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked from a distance away.</p>
<p>Bell smiled bitterly and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t think I can last more than two days. If possible, I want you to kill me today… keuk!”</p>
<p>Bell fell to his knees.</p>
<p>“Kueek….”</p>
<p>His back was bent, and his shoulders trembled violently.</p>
<p>As he desperately tried to endure the pain…</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>…He burst out with an otherworldly cry.</p>
<p>Soon, Bell’s right eye turned crimson, and the left side of his body flickered with black demonic energy.</p>
<p>“Kuk… Kuaaaak!”</p>
<p>But Bell forced Baal back. Baal screamed a couple times before calming down, and Bell collapsed onto the floor from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk walked up and knelt in front of him.</p>
<p>“…You okay?”</p>
<p>She asked worriedly. Bell smiled at her uncharacteristic action and shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not. Can you kill me now?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t answer. She hesitated. She knew she could kill Bell. A complete extermination of the soul through Reality Manipulation. With it, she could save Bell.</p>
<p>“…Huh? Wait.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Bell discovered Shin Jonghak standing behind Jin Sahyuk. He grinned and gestured at Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“You’re here, Myungchul’s grandson.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak didn’t answer. He was uncomfortable with hearing his grandfather’s name from Bell’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to hear our story? This might be the last chance…. Kuuek.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Bell scowled from the monstrous pain eating away his body.</p>
<p>“…I don’t see a reason I should hear you out.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak expressed his discomfort. Bell smiled looking at Shin Jonghak. He could feel demonic energy roiling inside him but endured it with all his effort.</p>
<p>“A reason to hear me out, you say….”</p>
<p>Bell wanted to tell Shin Jonghak about Shin Myungchul. No, he <em>had</em> to.</p>
<p>Bell’s encounter with Shin Myungchul wasn’t a coincidence, but fate. This was something he promised Shin Myungchul…</p>
<p>“The more I look at you, the more you resemble Myungchul….”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Shin Jonghak frowned.</p>
<p>“What are you blabbering on about?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, nothing much. I’m just saying you two are alike. Both in appearance and character.”</p>
<p>“Ha! Character?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak knew himself well enough to know that his character was nothing like Shin Myungchul’s. Naturally, what Bell said sounded like an insult to his grandfather.</p>
<p>“I dare you to say that again—”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about Shin Myungchul before he went back in time.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak became speechless. He had clearly taken the bait.</p>
<p>Bell couldn’t help but chuckle from Shin Jonghak’s cute reaction. He slowly continued his tale.</p>
<p>“…The world Myungchul lived in originally was a lot different than this world. Although science and technology paled in comparison to modern developments, they were still advancing. There was no room for devils to interfere. But Myungchul was anxious. I guess that’s why he wanted to go back in time.”</p>
<p>Bell stopped there as Shin Jonghak grabbed his Conqueror Spear. A cold, chilling voice flowed out from his mouth.</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth.”</p>
<p>“Shin Myungchul asked me.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s face distorted. But as far as Bell was concerned, this side of Shin Jonghak also resembled Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>“He asked me to tell his grandson the story of his life. So that his grandson wouldn’t make the same choice….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak clenched his teeth. He gripped his spear tighter. Seeing Shin Jonghak’s aggressive stance, Jin Sahyuk and Chae Nayun prepared themselves to stop him at any moment.</p>
<p>Bell continued.</p>
<p>“Myungchul made the first choice.”</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul’s first choice – going back in time.</p>
<p>Because of it, Baal reached Earth.</p>
<p>“Most likely, you’ll be the one to make the second choice.”</p>
<p>The second choice was still left. Shin Myungchul had left his final will in his grandson’s heart.</p>
<p>“Because…”</p>
<p>It was then. Rain entered through the broken window. Dense demonic energy blew in with the wind. The screams of civilians tore through the night sky. Demonic monsters had appeared with the earthquake.</p>
<p>“You might not know this, but Shin Myungchul left everything to you. He knew his son didn’t have the talent for it.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak looked out of the window. A pillar of golden light shot up to the sky, and the cries of demonic monsters rang out.</p>
<p>He could tell this was Kim Suho’s work. With that, Shin Jonghak turned back to Bell.</p>
<p>“So, you feel like hearing me out now?” Bell asked.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, who was quietly watching the two, murmured ‘whatever’ and jumped out of the window. She was clearly being sensible and letting Shin Jonghak make his decision alone. Of course, Jin Sahyuk stayed without paying attention to such things.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak glared at Jin Sahyuk and heaved out a disappointed sigh.</p>
<p>“…Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Next, he sat cross-legged on the floor. He still had his spear in his hand as if he wouldn’t hesitate to use it if Bell lied.</p>
<p>Bell looked at Shin Jonghak and recalled the day he met a man who looked just like Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>The day he met the violent, arrogant man living in discontent…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 336. The Stories of the Characters (2)</p>
<p>T/N: Return Stone changed to Regression Stone (for clarity).</p>
<p>Tower of Time.</p>
<p>This was where they first met.</p>
<p>—Are you the fairy of regression?</p>
<p>That was the first thing the man said when I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I remembered being unable to say a word, because I was too thrown off by the word ‘fairy’. After all, it was obvious to anyone looking that I wasn’t a fairy.</p>
<p>—Answer me. Are you the fairy of regression?</p>
<p>However, the man was persistent.</p>
<p>“Pft.”</p>
<p>Thanks to him, I couldn’t find the time to feel frustration or despair at having been reincarnated yet again. Of course, hearing my chuckle, the man frowned.</p>
<p>—…You think this is funny?</p>
<p>The sudden summoning surprised me, but I quickly understood the man’s circumstances. He must have climbed to the top of the Tower alone and found the ‘Regression Stone’. He must think it would let him go back in time, just like its name suggests.</p>
<p>—Who the hell are you? Why did you pop out of the Regression Stone? I won’t ask a third time. Answer.</p>
<p>The man raised the spear in his hand. The killing intent emanating from him woke me up. I stopped daydreaming and surveyed the area. I was unfamiliar with the surrounding scenery. However, just like always, I assumed I was reincarnated inside the seed that Baal planted – the Tower.</p>
<p>—…I’ll ask a third time. Who are you?</p>
<p>Seeing that I wasn’t talking, the man kindly gave me another chance. I smiled without replying just like before. I didn’t mean to smile, but it came out naturally when I saw the man’s otherworldly appearance. I wandered across many worlds, and his physical appearance ranked among the top.</p>
<p>—I’ll count to three. One, two… two and a half….</p>
<p>I immediately noticed that he was quite strange.</p>
<p>—…Two and a half and a half… Two and a half and a half and a half….</p>
<p>Thanks to him, I was able to loosen up and raise my body. When I got up, the man flinched and took a few steps back.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask first.”</p>
<p>—N-No, I’ll be the one to ask…</p>
<p>“Where are we?”</p>
<p>I asked the man.</p>
<p>—…The Tower of Time.</p>
<p>The man muttered back.</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>After destroying yet another world and aimlessly drifting through space, I had once again been summoned to another world by the selfishness of a human. By now, I was all too familiar with the development</p>
<p>—It’s your turn to answer me. Are you the fairy of regression?</p>
<p>The man, Shin Myungchul, asked me. I turned my head slightly and examined Shin Myungchul closely.</p>
<p>His eyes shone like gems that fell underwater. Even his long, unkempt hair was unable to conceal his good looks.</p>
<p>“I’m not a fairy, but a devil.”</p>
<p>I answered honestly. However, Shin Myungchul wasn’t taken aback in the slightest. His reaction surprised me.</p>
<p>—Fairies and devils are pretty much the same thing.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul was a man of strong character, both before and after he went back in time. But when I first met him, he was lost from the guilt and anger of being unable to protect his loved one.</p>
<p>—So, devil of regression, are you able to send me back in time?</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul wished to go back in time to change his past.</p>
<p>“It’s possible.”</p>
<p>I nodded my head without much thought. In that instant, Shin Myungchul smiled like a little kid and approached me as if to hold my hands in appreciation.</p>
<p>“But there’s a condition.”</p>
<p>—Condition? That’s fine. No matter what it is, I will…</p>
<p>“Once you go back in time, I will be beside you, annoying you the whole time.”</p>
<p>At the time, I took a more backhanded approach. I didn’t think to stop him or persuade him otherwise. I had given up before even trying, or perhaps I had resigned myself to this development. No matter the case, I knew humans weren’t capable of being persuaded by a stranger.</p>
<p>—You will be beside me?</p>
<p>“That’s right. If you don’t want that, then there’s nothing I can do.”</p>
<p>Humans who chose to borrow the power of a devil always came to regret it in the end. Watching their world being destroyed by their own hands, they hit their chests in mockery of their foolishness and cried out in sorrow and anger.</p>
<p>—I don’t care.</p>
<p>At that moment, I concluded Shin Myungchul would end up the same way.</p>
<p>“Great. But before we go back in time, there are few things I need to warn you about.”</p>
<p>—Go ahead.</p>
<p>The young Shin Myungchul was proud and arrogant. As I had experienced all sorts of people in the worlds I’ve been summoned to, I ignored Shin Myungchul’s character flaws and began my explanation.</p>
<p>“The Regression Stone is the medium for the summoning of the devil Baal. It will transport him from the transcendental plane in which he lives into this plane. If you go back in time using the Regression Stone’s power, Baal will undoubtedly descend in your world. That is the price you have to pay to go back in time. What you experience will not be a miracle, but a calamity that can destroy your world….”</p>
<p>—Pft, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>As I expected, Shin Myungchul was selfish, just like all the other Regressors who wished for the same thing.</p>
<p>“You will regret it.”</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that was different.</p>
<p>—I won’t regret it. If Baal descends on my world, I will just beat him up.</p>
<p>That was confidence.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul possessed confidence befitting his strength. With it, he grasped the Regression Stone without hesitation.</p>
<p>…Just like that, he went back to when he was 17, to the world where his lover and family were alive.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul cried tears of joy. With knowledge of the future, he grew rapidly. In just two years, he became a powerful Hero capable of protecting his loved ones.</p>
<p>Three years later, Shin Myungchul married his lover. A year after that, he had a child he never did in his previous life.</p>
<p>But fate couldn’t be changed so easily, and his happiness didn’t last forever.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul’s wife died from an illness not long after giving birth. Shin Myungchul cried until his tear glands dried up. The grief he felt was stronger because of how long he loved her.</p>
<p>However, Shin Myungchul had a son who needed his father. His grief was quickly replaced by a desire to protect his son.</p>
<p>Just like that, 30 years went by.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul finally witnessed his son becoming a father. Shin Myungchul named his grandson, ‘Shin Jonghak’.</p>
<p>I watched over Shin Myungchul the entire time.</p>
<p>Originally, I was supposed to make preparations for Baal’s descent. But unless it was absolutely necessary, I stayed by Shin Myungchul’s side. Seeing the once self-centered man grow up to be a grandfather was both fascinating and beautiful.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t that I didn’t do anything. I had no choice but to fulfill my duty as Baal’s host.</p>
<p>I met Yi Yeonjun, who caught Baal’s eyes, and formed the Chameleon Troupe. With him, I met kids like Yi Byul, Jain, and Kaita. I formed a family, just like Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>I liked Yi Yeonjun because he reminded me of the person I loved in the past; I liked Yi Byul simply because she was cute; I liked Jain because of her two-faced nature; and I liked Kaita because of his one-dimensional personality.</p>
<p>If possible, I wanted to stay with them for as long as possible.</p>
<p>But Baal didn’t let me.</p>
<p>The first seizure came abruptly. Baal rampaged inside my body. Knowing that I was getting attached to Earth, he sought to destroy it using my incarnation body without descending through the Demon Realm Gate.</p>
<p>Once enraged, Baal easily took over my body. However, his rampage ended in just a day. Shin Myungchul had come to stop him.</p>
<p>Just like he swore before returning to the past, Shin Myungchul beat up Baal.</p>
<p>But like a true villain, Baal chose to self-destruct. A third of the Korean Peninsula was at risk of total destruction. Meanwhile, I watched Shin Myungchul’s decision inside Baal’s consciousness.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Shin Myungchul did not hesitate in the slightest.</p>
<p>—If you can hear me, Bell, let me ask you for one last favor. Tell Jonghak my story. That way, he won’t become me. Help him achieve what I couldn’t. Jonghak is always saying he will become a great Hero… I believe him. He will become the greatest Hero of all time, even greater than me.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul left his will with me before forming a barrier with all his strength. He traded his life for the lives of millions. That was how the Hero Shin Myungchul met his fate.</p>
<p>“…What do you think?”</p>
<p>I finished my quick story and turned to Shin Jonghak. I had to summarize Shin Myungchul’s tale more than I would have liked to because of my body’s condition. But since I passed a part of my memories to Shin Jonghak with my magic power, he should be able to understand.</p>
<p>“Shin Myungchul’s act of sacrifice is lauded in textbooks as the epitome of heroism, but in truth, he was just taking responsibility for his past selfishness.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak didn’t say anything. With a stiff expression, he slumped his head and looked down at the ground. I chuckled and placed my hand on his head.</p>
<p>“Myungchul left his inheritance in your body. You should know what to do.”</p>
<p>Looking at his face, I wasn’t sure if he was listening. There was one last shocking truth I had to say, but I chose to keep it to myself. When I found out about it, even I was shaken.</p>
<p>“Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned to me. I could see myself through the reflection in her eyes. Demonic energy was swaying around me, and my eyes were dyed red.</p>
<p>I clearly didn’t have much time left.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk nodded her head at my request.</p>
<p>I endured the piercing pain in my body and made a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I would explain more, but I don’t have time.”</p>
<p>The final truth… that this world is nothing more than a ‘novel’ written by a certain man would be buried with me. I only found out because I looked into Kim Hajin’s head. So I didn’t need to worry.</p>
<p>“…It’s fine.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk got up with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>It had been far too long. It was frustrating to find out that the four, five hundred years I suffered weren’t even mentioned in the damn novel, but that didn’t matter now.</p>
<p>I no longer cared.</p>
<p>“I want to rest.”</p>
<p>After all, death would relieve me of all emotions…</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun swung his magic power. Tentacle-shaped magic power melted the ground and evaporated it into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Against him I used every single one of my Gifts and creations—[Extraction], [Complete Understanding of Spirit Power], [Random Consolidation System], [Desert Eagle], and more. I always preferred quantity over quality.</p>
<p>Even so, I couldn’t penetrate Yi Yeonjun’s defense.</p>
<p>The Desert Eagle rusted away. My armor broke. Aether shattered. All because the temperature continued to fluctuate between scorching heat and biting cold.</p>
<p>“…You have fascinating abilities.”</p>
<p>Amidst a piercing cold, Yi Yeonjun muttered nonchalantly. It was not a compliment, but a cynical expression of contempt.</p>
<p>“Yours is even more fascinating.”</p>
<p>The breath from my mouth froze white.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun twisted his lips.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>I was keeping my head above water thanks to the Orb of Regeneration. But I knew I couldn’t win against him. Rather, I purposely chose to use methods that couldn’t defeat him.</p>
<p>If I had attacked Yi Yeonjun from afar, my chances would have been much better. I might have killed him before he could react.</p>
<p>In fact, that was how I had planned to approach him up until 3 hours ago. However, in the end, I chose to face him head on. This decision was made on a whim.</p>
<p>“…I’m curious about something.”</p>
<p>Although moving my half-frozen lips hurt a lot, I managed to open my mouth. Sadly, Yi Yeonjun ignored me and shot his magic power. The heated beam of magic power pierced my shoulder.</p>
<p>I used my Gift [Constraints and Amplifications] to suppress my sensations. As a result, I didn’t feel any pain.</p>
<p>“I looked into your past.”</p>
<p>It was then that Yi Yeonjun finally showed a reaction. He glared at me with eyes full of hostility.</p>
<p>“What you did to bring Yi Byul into the Chameleon Troupe, what you did to Yi Byul’s parents to incite their fear for their daughter, how you turned Yi Byul’s life into a living hell when she could have led an ordinary life….”</p>
<p>I continued to list everything that I had witnessed in the past. But my speech was not for Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>I had no intention of persuading him. This world was not a novel, and I knew that the cliché of persuading a villain with smooth talk didn’t apply to me. After all, humans didn’t change so easily.</p>
<p>“The reason Yi Byul’s parents had to kill their daughter… I saw it all.”</p>
<p>I was speaking to the person who I knew was watching me from somewhere.</p>
<p>I couldn’t sense her presence and it would be a bummer if she wasn’t here, but I believed in my luck.</p>
<p>“…It must have been fun.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun smirked. This made me frown.</p>
<p>“Don’t you feel guilty for what you did?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. If it wasn’t for me, Byul would have lived among those trash forever.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun answered with confidence.</p>
<p>I scoffed in disbelief.</p>
<p>“…Why did you do it?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to own her.”</p>
<p>His voice sunk to the ground. He sounded stiff like a block of wood.</p>
<p>“When people break, they become easier to own. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>He was the perfect example of a two-dimensional villain I once read in a writing guidebook. A character who cannot and does not change no matter what, created for the sole purpose of becoming a villain.</p>
<p>I looked at Yi Yeonjun and forced a smile.</p>
<p>“It’s like you’re a character in a novel.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun shrugged and said, “Now it’s my turn to ask. Why are you with Byul? What about Byul do you-”</p>
<p>“I love her.”</p>
<p>My answer was brief as well. I spoke with emotion and with confidence.</p>
<p>“…Love?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>“Yeah. You know what that means, right? Ah, but maybe someone like you can't understand.”</p>
<p>The sound of teeth grinding rang out, and our conversation stopped there.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun gave off a much more powerful and violent magic power than before.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaa—!</em></p>
<p>His magic power turned into a bundle of tentacles. I didn’t dare to count how many there were. The grotesque strands either rose high in the sky or fell low to the ground before flying towards me.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa….</em></p>
<p>Countless tentacles blocked my view.</p>
<p>I knew couldn’t stop them.</p>
<p>I would probably die here, though I could still resurrect with my Unique Skill.</p>
<p>Then, I realized my luck had once again activated.</p>
<p>[Coincidentally, somebody listened to your true feelings and understood them.]</p>
<p>[Narrow Escape from Death (8/9) – Special stat, Accumulation of Luck, becomes partly unlocked!]</p>
<p>The flashing alerts told me so.</p>

<p>Chapter 337. The Stories of Characters (3)</p>
<p>Reality Manipulation, an Authority that allowed its user to interfere with the material world and manipulate reality itself.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk realized that she could kill Bell with her Authority. All she had to do was manipulate the ‘material’ that was Bell. Bell was no longer a human but ‘a container that held Baal’, so it wouldn’t be too difficult for Jin Sahyuk to transform his body.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk hesitated. Old memories kept coming back.</p>
<p>After meeting her end in Akatrina, she had reincarnated in a boring world called Earth. Her biological parents abandoned her before she could even memorize their faces. She went through the painful process of learning to walk and speak again in an orphanage.</p>
<p>When she turned three and was finally getting used to Earth’s language, Bell came to see her for the first time.</p>
<p>“…Oi.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk called Bell. Even as he experienced a tremendous amount of pain, Bell gave a sly smile that was so characteristic of himself.</p>
<p>“What? Got something to say to me?”</p>
<p>She stared at Bell in silence.</p>
<p>She had spent 25 years with Bell. Perhaps 25 years meant nothing to someone like Bell, but for an ordinary human like herself, 25 years was half her entire lifetime.</p>
<p>“…I do.”</p>
<p>Bell established himself as her teacher and helped awaken her Authority. In a sense, he was like a male nanny, watching over her as she grew. He endured her quick-tempered and selfish personality without much complaint.</p>
<p>Even if all that was just a buildup for this moment, right now, Jin Sahyuk felt the need to say something she had never said before.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Bell’s expression stiffened.</p>
<p>But soon, a playful smile once again spread across his face, and he looked at Jin Sahyuk proudly.</p>
<p>“No, I’m the one who should be thanking you.”</p>
<p>Bell’s words served as a signal. Jin Sahyuk nodded and gathered her magic power. Now, it was time to grant Bell’s wish.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>A whirlwind of black magic power shook like a storm as it formed around her hand.</p>
<p>This was Jin Sahyuk’s Authority that could melt and dismantle reality. She swung her hand that was tinged black like a spear.</p>
<p><em>Chwaak—!</em></p>
<p>Her hand penetrated Bell’s chest. It cut open his skin, broke his ribs, and reached his heart. Bell’s heart was beating vividly.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked into Bell’s eyes.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Bell met her gaze and waited for his end.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes and inhaled.</p>
<p><em>One, two, three.</em></p>
<p>She counted inside her head and opened her eyes again. Her entire body was overrun with magic power. She planned to invest her all in this final move.</p>
<p>Bell gave her his last smile.</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk nodded. She had already made her decision. Without hesitation, she released her magic power into Bell’s body.</p>
<p><em>Guooooo….</em></p>
<p>Her Authority engulfed Bell. Her magic power tore apart his veins and dove deeper into his body. The tornado of magic power soon reached the Authority ‘Magic Power Body’ etched in the center of Bell’s heart.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk poured all her magic power into the heart.</p>
<p>The goal of Reality Manipulation was to eliminate Magic Power Body.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>At that moment— an unimaginable amount of pain struck Bell. However, he neither screamed nor squirmed. With a faint smile, he placed his hand on Jin Sahyuk’s shoulder. </p>
<p>Bell remained calm throughout the whole process. He simply looked at Jin Sahyuk with the eyes of a proud father looking at his daughter.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaa…!</em></p>
<p>The movement of magic power quickened, and the ‘human shell’ containing Bell began to fall apart. Patches of his skin turned into dust and disappeared into thin air, and the bones, muscles, nerves, and organs underneath them began to fade away as well.</p>
<p>“…Goodbye.”</p>
<p>At the moment of Bell’s death, Jin Sahyuk offered him her last words. Bell did not return an answer but only a smile, one that seemed to belong to the happiest man on earth.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk wished for him to rest in peace, surrounded by only the happiest memories.</p>
<p>…However.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a tremendous amount of magic power appeared at the spot where Bell had just disappeared.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>The magic power immediately spread outside the mansion and formed a dome-shaped barrier.</p>
<p>The barrier caged not only Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak but also the entire [Leores Plaza]. Even so, Jin Sahyuk remained calm. She knew who the magic power belonged to.</p>
<p>Baal.</p>
<p>—Haaa….</p>
<p>The strongest of the evil gods, the rank 1 devil. </p>
<p>He had broken out of his container and descended as a devil.</p>
<p>—…I’ve waited for far too long.</p>
<p>Baal and Bell looked alike. Their appearances were almost identical, except for the horn on Baal’s forehead and his crimson eyes.</p>
<p>—So you are the one who granted my friend’s wish.</p>
<p>His voice vibrated in a way that no human’s voice could vibrate. Baal looked at Jin Sahyuk and smiled. Though the presence of the evil god was certainly overwhelming, Jin Sahyuk stepped forward without getting intimidated.</p>
<p>“It’s your turn to keep your promise.”</p>
<p>—…Promise.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Or, did you not hear about the promise?”</p>
<p>—Of course, I did.</p>
<p>Baal shook his head. He then formed a rock and handed it to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>—Take it. It’s what you wanted, a stone that will transfer you to another dimension. Once you pour your magic power into this stone, a dimensional portal will appear. Your power is special, after all.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked at the rock with suspicion. But the magical rock appeared authentic. According to Bell, Baal was a devil who kept his promises.</p>
<p>“By the way, what did you mean by ‘my friend’? You considered Bell your friend?” Jin Sahyuk asked as she slid the rock into her pocket.</p>
<p>—693 years is a long time, even for me. He’s been with me all those years, and I reckon that qualifies him as my friend.</p>
<p>“…Then, I assume you’re sad?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked sarcastically. The word ‘friend’ bothered her. What kind of person would enslave his friend for 693 years?</p>
<p>—He was a useful friend, but it’s okay. 693 years was long enough. He can go. The one who truly wants to be with me is here right now.</p>
<p>Baal smiled, looking into the distance. His gaze traveled to the wall that Chae Nayun and Jin Sahyuk had destroyed upon entering.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk widened her eyes and followed Baal’s gaze.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>In the darkness, she saw Yi Yeonjun. She noticed that one of his arms had been torn off from an apparent battle.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here? And where’d you lose your arm?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked mockingly, causing Yi Yeonjun to glare at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>He answered, “I’ve been betrayed.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>His answer was so random that Jin Sahyuk couldn’t help but frown.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England — Evandel’s domain]</p>
<p>—Valac’s army is causing an uproar across Europe. Germany has decided to retaliate, while Italy has chosen to respond more realistically….</p>
<p>—Next up is Spain. ‘Astaroth’s army’ has appeared from inside Astaroth’s barrier-</p>
<p>—We have breaking news. Djinns are currently invading by sea. All citizens near the coast must evacuate.</p>
<p>Valac and the other hostile devils were rampaging all across the world.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In was watching the news on her smartwatch when she heard the sound of a belt tightening around the waist and turned her head to the side.</p>
<p>“All done. I’m finished,” Evandel announced and clenched her fists.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In scanned the girl carefully.</p>
<p>The hat Kim Hajin got her, the robe that improves its wearer’s resistance and adaptability, and the belt that exudes defense magic in response to enemy attacks. Everything was perfect.</p>
<p>“I see that you’re dressed up… but are you sure you can do it?” Ah Hae-In asked carefully.</p>
<p>Evandel’s talent was now in full bloom, but to her teacher’s eyes, she was still just a child who needed protection.</p>
<p>“Yeah! I can do it!”</p>
<p>Despite her teacher’s worries, Evandel nodded confidently.</p>
<p>There was only one reason that Evandel endured a period of loneliness to build her domain - to protect.</p>
<p>Evandel wanted to protect Rachel, Hajin, her friends, as well as the good people and animals around the world.</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In nodded proudly.</p>
<p>“Then, get ready.”</p>
<p>“Okay-!” Evandel shouted. At the same time, Ah Hae-In and Evandel each summoned their spirit beasts. The pair stared at the demonic monsters that were beginning to appear from beneath the horizon.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin and other Heroes had not returned from the Demon Realm Gate yet, but such fact could not hold them back. They would have to win without the Heroes’ help.</p>
<p>“Go,” Ah Hae-In muttered, and the Cardinal Beast, Azure Dragon, appeared.</p>
<p><em>Grrrrr….</em></p>
<p>The Azure Dragon revealed his gigantic figure and placed Ah Hae-In on his head. Meanwhile, Evandel got on a unicorn that was much smaller than the Azure Dragon.</p>
<p>—Look, over there! It’s the Azure Dragon!</p>
<p>—There’s also a unicorn!</p>
<p>—W-Wow!</p>
<p>Reporters, drones, camera crews, Heroes and citizens who had been waiting near Evandel's domain all turned their gaze to the pair.</p>
<p>At the center of the attention of the eager and hopeful audience— Evandel cried.</p>
<p>“Let’s gooooo—!”</p>
<p>Her cute voice was full of determination.</p>
<p><em>Rumble—!</em></p>
<p>Evandel’s spirit beasts began to dash at their master’s command towards the ‘villains’ on the other side of the ocean.</p>
<p>The footsteps of individual spirit beasts soon merged into one and became a giant roar that shook the earth.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Demon Realm Gate — The Republic of Leores after Baal’s descent]</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. My back was in touch with something soft and the ceiling looked unfamiliar.</p>
<p><em>Gulp—</em></p>
<p>I swallowed hard and began thinking.</p>
<p>I knew for sure that I hadn’t revived. I would know if I did.</p>
<p>The most likely explanation was that Boss, who had been listening in on our conversation, saved me. The fact that I was alive meant that Boss defeated Yi Yeonjun, and….</p>
<p>“You up?”</p>
<p>“Uaak!”</p>
<p>I turned to the voice in surprise. I thought my heart might burst, but soon heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>It was Jain. She was sitting at the bedside in her original appearance which I hadn’t seen in a while.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m awake. Long time no see, Jain.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s been a while~ I missed you. How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>“Fine. More importantly, where’s Boss?”</p>
<p>When I asked Jain about Boss, she smiled bitterly and drew the curtain, then pointed outside the window.</p>
<p>I was speechless.</p>
<p>The scenery just outside the window was hell-like.</p>
<p>“…What is that?”</p>
<p>The Leores Plaza, where the Transnational Peace Conference should have been held, was surrounded by a huge barrier, as a dark storm raged everywhere and gargoyles and other creatures roamed the sky.</p>
<p>“As you can see, it’s a mess. I managed to escape with you, but Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, Yun Seung-Ah and Boss… they’re all stuck in there.”</p>
<p>“…Has Baal descended?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Jain nodded casually.</p>
<p>“It happened much quicker than we all had expected. Bell’s dead and Baal descended.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Oh, and I heard about Yeonjun-ssi. I didn’t know. Thanks for bringing me to my senses. I almost got persuaded by Yeonjun-ssi, too~”</p>
<p>Jain beamed.</p>
<p>Dazed, I stared at Jain before turning my gaze to the barrier that was likely formed by Baal.</p>
<p>“Is Boss in there?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She’s waiting for you, probably~?”</p>
<p>I then turned my gaze to the corner of the room. My weapons were there. Aether, the Black Lotus Uniform, Temujin’s Bow, and the Pinnacle-grade Artifact [Ancient Hero Leoricus’s Exorcism Bow].</p>
<p>“I fixed them all. I used the Regeneration Orb or whatever it’s called to fix them~”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>I got up from the bed and tried to approach my weapons.</p>
<p>“Sure~ By the way, you have a nice body, Hajin~”</p>
<p>But then Jain said something weird. It was then that I finally realized the cause of my sense of disharmony.</p>
<p>I was completely naked.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, Aether, having noticed my perplexity, flew at me and stuck to my body. Aether transformed into a piece of cloth and covered my vital(?) area.</p>
<p>“Kuhum. Kmmmm.”</p>
<p>I let out a dry cough and armed myself.</p>
<p>First, I put on the Black Lotus Uniform, then I put Desert Eagle into its holster. Finally, I turned to the two bows.</p>
<p>[Temujin’s Bow Blessed by Horus]</p>
<p>[Ancient Hero Leoricus’s Exorcism Bow]</p>
<p>I had yet to synthesize the two weapons.</p>
<p>“Synthesis.”</p>
<p>Now seemed like a good time.</p>
<p>[You have activated Lv.10 Synthesis.]</p>
<p>[Fusing a pinnacle-grade item with a pinnacle-grade item….]</p>
<p>[The success rate is extremely low….]</p>
<p>If this was a game, what I was doing right now would equal the act of combining two of the rarest types of items. Therefore, it wasn’t surprising that the success rate was extremely low. My luck had always hurdled tasks that seemed impossible, however.</p>
<p>[Your luck has been activated!]</p>
<p>[A tremendous amount of luck has increased the rate of success!]</p>
<p>[‘Young Dwarf’s Dexterity’ has also responded!]</p>
<p>Golden confetti covered the System, and as a result….</p>
<p>[Your skill has successfully synthesized ‘Black Lotus Bow’ from ‘Temujin’s Bow Blessed By Horus’ and ‘Ancient Hero Leoricus’s Exorcism Bow’!]</p>
<p>[With ‘Young Dwarf’s Dexterity’, you have created a world-class weapon. You earned SP!]</p>
<p>The pair of bows clung to each other and transformed into an even more powerful artifact. Its name was simple: ‘Black Lotus Bow’. As an artifact born of my skill and Gifts, this bow was truly one of a kind.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I scrutinized the bow’s information.</p>
<p>“Wow~ What’s that~? It looks really good~”</p>
<p>Jain exclaimed in admiration before I even finished reading the item information.</p>
<p>I nodded with a small smile.</p>
<p>“You’re right. It is good.”</p>
<p>“…Then, are you ready to go?”</p>
<p>I took a deep breath.</p>
<p>Then I nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>This could be <em>the</em> last battle.</p>
<p>I no longer had any reason to conserve SP, Stigma’s magic power, God-slaying Bullet or anything else.</p>
<p>I vowed to stake my all.</p>
<p>“Let’s go end everything.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 338. The Stories of Characters (4)</p>
<p>I walked to Baal’s barrier with Jain. The surrounding area could only be described as total chaos. The Transnational Peace Conference’s joyous atmosphere had been thoroughly destroyed, and key buildings like the residence of the Republic’s president had been swallowed up as well.</p>
<p>“It’s only been a day since this barrier formed. It swallowed almost half of the entire capital. Do you have any plans to deal with it?”</p>
<p>I shook my head at Jain’s question. I didn’t have a plan or even a bright idea. I knew nothing of its setting, so its weakness was anyone’s guess. I had not described Baal or his abilities anywhere in my novel.</p>
<p>“Then what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“…I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>I checked the amount of SP and DP I had, which turned out to be 4030 SP and an overflowing amount of DP.</p>
<p>“Jain, do you know if this world has demon merchants?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, yeah, I heard they’re living around the outskirts of the continent. But they might be on their way here considering what’s going on. Why? Do you have extra DP to spend?”</p>
<p>“I do, almost a million.”</p>
<p>With my sponsorship, Litrain was now a world-renowned knight known as the Knight of Brilliance. Thanks to her, I had close to a million DP.</p>
<p>“…How?”</p>
<p>Jain’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“There’s something called a ‘luck bonus’. Every time I get 100 DP, I get another 20 DP… Anyways, that’s not what’s important right now.”</p>
<p>I looked up at the dome-shaped barrier piercing the sky and took out the [Mystic Key].</p>
<p>“First, let’s go inside.”</p>
<p>“Mm… Are you sure that key will work~? It’s Baal’s barrier, after all.”</p>
<p>Jain doubted the Mystic Key’s power. I couldn’t blame her considering how tiny and insignificant it looked.</p>
<p>“Once I strengthen its ability a few times, it should be able to break a part of the barrier.”</p>
<p>At that moment, several footsteps rang out from the right. Jain and I slowly turned our heads to that direction. To our surprise, Arunheim’s knights were rushing towards us.</p>
<p>“…Who are they?”</p>
<p>Jain shrugged. Hearing her, the leader of the knights stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Can you really break a part of the barrier?”</p>
<p>A woman’s voice rang out. The knight took off her helmet. I immediately recognized her face. She was Airun, the knight commander who gave me the order to escort Harin.</p>
<p>She looked like she was on the verge of crying. No, I could see traces of tears around her eyes. It must be because of the guilt of being unable to protect her lord as a knight.</p>
<p>“Yes, it should be possible.”</p>
<p>I took off my robe as I replied. When Airun saw my face, her eyebrows rose in shock.</p>
<p>“You are….”</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about that after we break open the barrier.”</p>
<p>I cut Airun off before she could finish her thought. I cloaked the Mystic Key with Aether. The key grew slightly bigger.</p>
<p>“…Can that really open the barrier?”</p>
<p>Airun’s voice trembled anxiously.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“…Then please hurry. I’m dying from being unable to do anything. Our Prince is waiting for us inside the barrier.”</p>
<p>Airun pleaded earnestly. I could feel how sincere she was in wanting to protect Arunheim’s prince.</p>
<p>“Our Prince….”</p>
<p>Her trembling hands touched the surface of the barrier. However, the barrier instantly pushed her back.</p>
<p>“…Got it.”</p>
<p>I added [Random Consolidation System] and [Constraints and Amplifications] to the key. Then, I shoved the key inside the barrier.</p>
<p><em>Tzzzt—!</em></p>
<p>Powerful sparks crackled when the two magic powers clashed. I infused Stigma’s magic power into the Mystic Key, and it seeped into the barrier through the key.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa….</em></p>
<p>Both the barrier and the ground around us rumbled. Then, a crack appeared in the barrier around the key.</p>
<p>The knights swallowed their saliva, and I poured in half of my remaining Stigma.</p>
<p><em>Clang—</em></p>
<p>In the next instant, a sharp sound rang out, and a side of the barrier began to crumble.</p>
<p>“I-It opened—!”</p>
<p>Airun shouted ecstatically. She burst into tears, as did the rest of the knights. They approached me and expressed their gratitude.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I was slightly taken aback by their overreaction.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[United States of America – Leraje’s Devil’s Castle]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Leraje was lounging around in her newfound home, waiting for her game to be completed. Thanks to her patience, the Americas were far more peaceful than Europe.</p>
<p>However, the employees of the gaming company Leol were feeling more pressured than ever. They frequently kept themselves going by taking drugs and potions, and seven of them even collapsed from stress. They worked without a single moment of rest.</p>
<p>It was all for the single customer awaiting their work.</p>
<p>“…Lord Leraje, the game is almost complete.”</p>
<p>In a dark room of the Devil’s Castle, Leol’s CEO, Varan, bowed in front of Leraje. Leraje looked down at him with bored eyes before skillfully typing on a keyboard.</p>
<p>—That’s good to hear. What type of game is it?</p>
<p>Varan glanced at the reply Leraje typed.</p>
<p>“It’s a combination of training, battling, strategy, adventure, and travel. This game will surely be the greatest game ever to be created….”</p>
<p>The countless hours his employees put in and the encouragement(?) from the demons finally allowed the game to enter its final stage of development.</p>
<p>Naturally, Varan had mixed feelings about it. He was worried that Leraje would not like it, yet he was excited about what he believed would be the greatest game of the century.</p>
<p>—I see. But would a human be able to defeat me in that game?</p>
<p>“How could a mere human accomplish such a thing.”</p>
<p>—I don’t like imbalanced games.</p>
<p>‘I don’t like.’</p>
<p>When these three words came out, the faces of the demons around the room turned sharp.</p>
<p>“I-It won’t be.”</p>
<p>Varan quickly slammed his head on the ground.</p>
<p>“The game will have a raid system.”</p>
<p>—Explain.</p>
<p>“No human is capable of defeating Lord Leraje in a one on one confrontation. I have personally seen Lord’s overwhelming control, which has surpassed human capabilities. In our game, a level 1 expert is capable of defeating a level 50 player depending on the level of control, so—”</p>
<p>—So humans will work together to defeat me. A true test of skill. That is something I like. I hate luck-dependent games.</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>The demons’ expressions softened, and Varan heaved out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>—But…</p>
<p>‘But’. Varan almost fainted when he heard that word.</p>
<p>—You are wrong.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Varan saw his life flash before his eyes. He became certain of his death.</p>
<p>‘Wrong’. Now that Leraje had muttered that word, Varan knew there was no way out…</p>
<p>“L-Lord, please spare my life—”</p>
<p>—There is one human who defeated me.</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Varan’s jaw dropped. Leraje skillfully moved her fingers and opened her record in a game called [Gladiator of the Century]. To Varan’s surprise, Leraje had several consecutive losses.</p>
<p>—I assume you can see it.</p>
<p>Varan’s head turned blank. He couldn’t believe there was someone capable of defeating this devil. From what he could see, Leraje was even more of a devil inside virtual reality, because many renowned experts of Earth, like Heynckes and Chae Joochul, didn’t know how to even enter the virtual world.</p>
<p>—His ID is Extra 7.</p>
<p>Leraje pulled up Extra 7’s player info.</p>
<p>—Find him for me.</p>
<p>Varan and Leraje’s subordinates all had dazed looks on their faces. Even the demons seemed shocked that their lord had lost.</p>
<p>—I witnessed unimaginable movements and game sense. At the time, I was simply angry at my consecutive losses, but now that I think about it, I have much to learn from him.</p>
<p>As Leraje explained, the room was filled with silence. A devil admitting that she had much to learn from a human. Varan was shocked beyond belief.</p>
<p>—But now that I am more experienced, I would like to defeat him with my own hands.</p>
<p>Leraje smiled faintly as she typed her final sentence. In the Demon Realm, one would be lucky to see her smile once in a hundred years. Now that she had revealed her smile, the demons in the room all felt their heart shake.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Baal’s Barrier – Destroyed Mansion]</p>
<p>Baal left Shin Jonghak and Jin Sahyuk behind. Jin Sahyuk said Baal was most likely constructing his Devil’s Castle and that now was the best chance to stop him, but Shin Jonghak sat in the corner of the destroyed mansion without moving an inch.</p>
<p>His heart didn’t pound, and his body was frozen. With the image of the grandfather he respected and admired shattered, he seemed to have lost himself in a sense of emptiness.</p>
<p>“…Yo, idiot, are you gonna just sit there?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk called Shin Jonghak once again. However, Shin Jonghak didn’t react in the slightest.</p>
<p>“Tsk, pathetic. Really, I’ve never seen someone more pathetic.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sneered openly.</p>
<p>“We found Lady Seraine! She’s safe inside the underground bunker!”</p>
<p>At that moment, an urgent voice rang out outside the window. Shin Jonghak closed his eyes, wanting to ignore everything.</p>
<p>“Open your eyes, fool.”</p>
<p>“Ak!”</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk stabbed Shin Jonghak’s eyes with her fingers. After wiggling in pain, Shin Jonghak shot his eyes open and glared at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“You piece of… Haa.”</p>
<p>The usual Shin Jonghak would have cursed and swung his spear. But the current Shin Jonghak only sighed and stumbled down helplessly.</p>
<p>“…You don’t understand.”</p>
<p>He muttered as he reminisced about his past.</p>
<p>The reason he wanted to become a Hero was solely because of his grandfather, Shin Myungchul. The reason he was proud of himself was because he was a descendant of the man lauded as the greatest Hero in history.</p>
<p>“You don’t understand what I lived for, what I wished for.”</p>
<p>But that legend was now gone. His faith had been shattered by the cold truth that Shin Myungchul was someone who invited Baal to his world.</p>
<p><em>Kwak—!</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk kicked Shin Jonghak’s shoulder. Shin Jonghak fell backward without uttering a cry. Then, Jin Sahyuk clicked her tongue and spoke in frustration.</p>
<p>“He was the most heroic person among the fools who called themselves a hero.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“Your grandfather. I’ve seen him before while I was traveling with Bell.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s expression stiffened as if to ask why she had never mentioned it until now. Jin Sahyuk looked out the window and continued.</p>
<p>“Shin Myungchul risked his life to correct his mistake. That means he possesses the quality of a hero.”</p>
<p><em>Sssss—</em> Then, a faint vibration shook the barrier. Jin Sahyuk’s eyebrows went up when she saw it. She continued as she observed the barrier.</p>
<p>“So get up and fight. Didn’t Bell tell you? That Shin Myungchul left something with you. Bell isn’t a liar.”</p>
<p><em>Ssssss.</em> The vibration grew bigger, and a small crack appeared in Baal’s barrier. Someone was clearly trying to break in.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk quickly understood who was responsible.</p>
<p>“If you still want to just sit there….”</p>
<p>She smirked and looked down at Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“Then go ahead. Disgrace your grandfather’s name all you want. A man bigger than you has just arrived. Someone like you is unnecessary.”</p>
<p>“…What?’</p>
<p>Hearing this, Shin Jonghak’s face distorted. A smile emerged on Jin Sahyuk’s face as she stared out the window. Provoked, Shin Jonghak slowly got up. Then, he witnessed it himself.</p>
<p><em>Crack—</em></p>
<p>The crack appearing on Baal’s barrier.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s shoulders tensed up. Jin Sahyuk continued to observe the crack as she muttered.</p>
<p>“…Look. He survives like a cockroach and always comes crawling back.”</p>
<p><em>Boom—!</em></p>
<p>An earth-shattering boom rang out. A part of the barrier crumbled down, and a certain man emerged from the rubble.</p>
<p>“People like that are surprisingly cool.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Next to him was an army of knights. Even Shin Jonghak had to admit that his entrance was cool.</p>
<p>“…Bullshit.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak snorted. He felt discomfort in his chest. He knew it was from his distaste of Kim Hajin, and it cleanly burned away his internal despair and helplessness.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look good no matter what he does.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak laughed inwardly as he clearly recognized he was being jealous. Right, he was jealous. After all these years, he finally admitted this feeling. After all, didn’t Bell say Shin Myungchul was also a jealous character?</p>
<p>Now that he knew his grandfather was full of flaws, he felt like he could finally drop his high and mighty attitude.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked with a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>“…Can’t you tell by his average-looking face?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak sneered. The feelings he never admitted, the feelings that had driven him to his current level – envy and jealousy.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look as good as me.”</p>
<p>After admitting them wholeheartedly, he picked up his Conqueror Spear.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 339. The Stories of Characters (5)</p>
<p>[Republic of Leores - Large underground bunker]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kim Suho headed to an underground bunker in the Republic's capital to evacuate the rescued citizens. The bunker, which was designed by Yoo Yeonha, was fully capable of accommodating the majority of citizens.</p>
<p>“Thank you, thank you….”</p>
<p>After smiling at the citizens’ tearful expression of gratitude, he headed to Yoo Yeonha’s office.</p>
<p>A nameplate that read [Bunker Operations Planning Office] hung at the door.</p>
<p>Inside, Yoo Yeonha was speaking to outsiders on the radio.</p>
<p>“…Did you just say that the right side of the barrier was breached?”</p>
<p>This took Kim Suho by surprise. Baal’s barrier was difficult to break even with his Gift.</p>
<p>“Mm… got it. Ah, we’re protecting Miss Seraine, so you don’t have to worry about her. Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha threw a glance at Kim Suho and cut off the radio.</p>
<p>Kim Suho was the first to speak.</p>
<p>“The barrier was breached?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, apparently.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had a rough idea of who was responsible for the destruction. Naturally, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>‘I hadn’t heard from him in a while and wondered if something bad had happened, but I guess he’s alive and well.’</p>
<p>“Who-”</p>
<p><em>KOOONG—!</em> But the door swung open even before Kim Suho could finish his question. Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha turned their gazes to the entrance.</p>
<p>Aileen was there.</p>
<p>She approached them with an excited expression and yelled, “Black Lotus is here!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Yoo Yeonha each responded differently.</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s nostrils flared in surprise, while Yoo Yeonha carefully examined the reactions of both Aileen and Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Aileen nodded eagerly and continued.</p>
<p>“Yes! Oh and, also, Shin Jonghak.”</p>
<p>At this point in time, Yoo Yeonha could no longer feign indifference.</p>
<p>She asked, trying to conceal her interest.</p>
<p>“…Jonghak is here?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I just got a call from Yun Seung-Ah, and he’s with Jin Sahyuk or whatever her name was.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk. Those three syllables made her uneasy.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha turned her gaze to Kim Suho in silence. Likewise, Kim Suho had become stiff like a fish that had been left outside to dry for too long.</p>
<p>“…Kim Suho?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha called Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Kim Suho, standing stiff, soon let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“Uh… what were they doing together? Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak?”</p>
<p>“How should I know? But Seung-Ah said they were heading to the ‘Devil’s Castle’.”</p>
<p>Baal had built a fortress at the center of his barrier. Inside, Baal was currently gathering power to descend on Earth.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t we head there as well?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded at Aileen’s question.</p>
<p>“Yes. We only have two days left, after all. We should hurry.”</p>
<p>“Two days? How do you know it’s two days exactly?”</p>
<p>“The book said this world was destroyed three days after Baal’s descent, remember?”</p>
<p>The deadline was three days, but a day had already passed. The remaining time, therefore, was two days. It was too short a time, but they had to somehow stop Baal from destroying this world and also their home, Earth.</p>
<p>“For now, let’s hurry.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho took out a potion from his pocket and gulped it down. This might not be enough to relieve all the fatigue and wounds he had accumulated during the day, but he had no time to spare.</p>
<p>“Okay. Then, let’s go find Black Lotus and Jin Sahyuk first.”</p>
<p>With a smirk, Aileen grabbed Kim Suho’s hand. She immediately activated the skill [Teleport]. The whole world began shaking and Kim Suho closed his eyes. A moment later, when he opened them again, the Devil’s Castle was in front of him.</p>
<p>The shift was very sudden, but he had no time to panic.</p>
<p>“…Kim Suho?”</p>
<p>From somewhere rang a dry, disapproving voice.</p>
<p>Aileen and Kim Suho turned back, and to their surprise, the two people who had just been the subject of their conversation were there.</p>
<p>“…Aileen-ssi, your Teleport is shockingly accurate.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho exclaimed in pure amazement, but Aileen only blinked rapidly and scratched the back of her neck. All this took her by surprise as well.</p>
<p>“Did you two follow us?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak. About ten steps away, the pair scowled at Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Huh? No, we wouldn’t say we were….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho panicked for no reason. Were those two always so close? He remembered they didn’t get along very well in the past.</p>
<p>“Hmm… whatever. You should get ready, too.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said calmly, despite Kim Suho’s perplexity.</p>
<p>“…Get ready for what?” Aileen asked.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk scoffed, as if making fun of Aileen for asking such a silly question, then pointed to the Devil’s Castle in the distance.</p>
<p>What used to be the presidential residence was now Baal’s castle. Surrounded by demonic energy, it had become quite grotesque in appearance.</p>
<p>“That castle needs to come down.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? You?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s eyes widened to the extent that they almost bulged out.</p>
<p>The Jin Sahyuk he knew was not like this. Not long ago, she had declared she would destroy Earth if she couldn’t go back to her homeland.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shook her head with a cold smile.</p>
<p>‘Of course,’ thought Kim Suho. But then Jin Sahyuk’s next remark made him freeze.</p>
<p>“We’re doing it together.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Eastern Pandemonium]</p>
<p>Vassago built his Colosseum in what was once a city called Harbin. The land shared its border with Russia and boasted a view of the Korean Peninsula to the south.</p>
<p>The Colosseum, bearing the design of the Demon Realm, was large and magnificent enough to be seen from both Korea and Russia.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Colosseum had already become a symbol of terror for many. Today, however, a Hero arrived at the Colosseum purely of her own will.</p>
<p>“…It’s big.”</p>
<p>Master-rank Hero, Jin Seyeon the Divine Archer.</p>
<p>Having challenged Vassago, she looked around the Colosseum in a daze.</p>
<p>“Only those who lack skill care about appearance.”</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>A heavy voice rang out just behind her. Jin Seyeon immediately withdrew her gaze from the Colosseum and turned around.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Archer.”</p>
<p>It was Cheok Jungyeong, as expected. His face broke into a broad grin. Jin Seyeon was glad to see him smile, though she wasn’t exactly sure why.</p>
<p>She smiled back at him softly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know we were close enough to share such a greeting.”</p>
<p>“Who cares? We can get to know each other from now on.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong shrugged. Jin Seyeon nodded in agreement. Though she had no idea what would happen in this arena, she felt confident that Cheok Jungyeong would never betray her.</p>
<p>“Oh, right. You must know this since you’re a high-ranking Hero. Is it true that Orden is alive?”</p>
<p><em>Koong— koong— koong—</em> Cheok Jungyeong walked barefoot and stood right next to Jin Seyeon. Their height difference was at least 40 centimeters. Jin Seyeon had to tilt her head back so much that her neck began to hurt.</p>
<p>“Well, if Orden is really alive, that would mean we’re really close to him right now.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon answered without much thought. A long walk east of the Colosseum would reach Vladivostok. Vladivostok was where the rumors about Orden originated from.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong raised his eyebrows, dissatisfied by Jin Seyeon’s answer.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I asked. I asked if he’s alive.”</p>
<p>“The residents of Vladivostok seem to think so. They worship Orden.”</p>
<p>“…Worship?”</p>
<p>“Yes. According to them, it’s all thanks to Orden that they live in peace in Vladivostok, a city that had long been abandoned, without having to worry about monster invasions.”</p>
<p>“Huh… so it’s true that Orden’s been hunting monsters himself?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure about that. It could be someone else, someone strong but also secretive, like Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon shrugged, and Cheok Jungyeong chuckled.</p>
<p>“Pft, alright, whatever. I didn’t come here for a chat anyway.”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon stood side by side and stared at the arena in front of them. But these two weren’t the only ones who had their eyes on the Colosseum.</p>
<p>Many were observing it from afar, including the members of the Chameleon Troupe who had followed Cheok Jungyeong secretly, and Vast Expense, who was exuding his presence openly.</p>
<p>And so, Cheok Jungyeong stepped into the ring and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He then yelled from the top of his lungs, “Oi, old man—!”</p>
<p>His voice shook the earth and the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong called Vast Expense with overt enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you gonna come out-?!”</p>
<p>His cry echoed through the Colosseum.</p>
<p>But Vast Expense did not respond, only watching from afar.</p>
<p>“…Well, it’s pretty obvious what that greedy old man is after.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungeyong muttered discontentedly.</p>
<p>Vast Expense’s reason for coming here was obvious as he said. Vassago had declared that he would reward the victor with whatever he wished. Vast Expense was probably planning to ask for ‘immortality’.</p>
<p>“Never mind those cowards. Let’s go first.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong tapped Jin Seyeon on the shoulder. Jin Seyeon, however, seemed a little hesitant as she looked around Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>She was trying to locate Black Lotus but could not detect his presence anywhere nearby.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Was Cheok Jungyeong alone? Did Black Lotus enter the Demon Realm Gate as well?</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon concealed her disappointment and began walking.</p>
<p>“I guess you aren’t called Divine Archer for nothing. Bwahaha. Oh, by the way-”</p>
<p>Impressed by her boldness, Cheok Jungyeong beamed with satisfaction as he pulled out a card. Jin Seyeon looked at the card.</p>
<p>It was called [The Invitation Letter to the Love Room].</p>
<p>“What’s this…?”</p>
<p>“A card that allows me to summon one of my friends. I know who you’re looking for, so let’s get along from now on.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>To her surprise, he was more tactful than she thought. Though Jin Seyeon was embarrassed that he had read her mind, she soon gave a small smile and nodded.</p>
<p>“Good idea.”</p>
<p>It’s like the saying- the end justifies the means.</p>
<p>“Cool. Now, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s.”</p>
<p>Together, Jin Seyeon and Cheok Jungyeong walked into the mouth of the devil ‘Vassago’ side by side.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[The Republic of Leores]</p>
<p>Airun and her knights began fighting monsters as soon as they entered the barrier. They wielded their swords to find and rescue the prince.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jain and I left. Right now I didn’t have the strength to fight monsters. Just by breaking the barrier, I’d consumed most of my Stigma.</p>
<p>-Boss. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>The first thing I did was send Boss a message. But she didn’t reply for a long time.</p>
<p>‘Did something bad happen to her?’</p>
<p>Just as I began to worry, Boss’s voice flowed into my ears.</p>
<p>-…I hear you, Hajin.</p>
<p>Her voice was cracked and frail.</p>
<p>It was faintly trembling as if she had been crying all this time.</p>
<p>-Where are you?</p>
<p>-…Sorry. I’d like to be alone for a while.</p>
<p>I never imagined that Boss could sound so weak and pitiful. She refused my visit in a roundabout way.</p>
<p>I said with a small sigh.</p>
<p>-Okay. Then… rest well. But it’s just for today because I’ll come by tomorrow.</p>
<p>Boss whispered.</p>
<p>-…Thank you.</p>
<p>-Sure.</p>
<p>I dismissed Mental Transmission without further ado.</p>
<p>Boss seemed to be struggling, but at least she was safe. That’s all that mattered to me. As long as she was alive, we could fix things. We could heal.</p>
<p>…A sense of relief swept through me.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here!”</p>
<p>Someone grabbed me by the neck. When I turned around, I saw Shimurin. With a big grin, Shimurin looked at Jain and me alternately.</p>
<p>“I see you’re with a woman disguised as a man today.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Oh. Haha.”</p>
<p>Shimurin saw through Jain’s disguise at once. Jain stepped back in surprise.</p>
<p>“Why are you here, Shimurin-ssi?”</p>
<p>“Why do you think? I also have some questions for him over there.”</p>
<p>With a surprisingly solemn expression, Shimurin pointed at the Devil’s Castle at the center of the barrier.</p>
<p>“I believe he possesses an essential knowledge of dimensional migration.”</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Once again, Shimurin’s instinct was correct. Baal had confidently stated that he could send Jin Sahyuk back to her native dimension.</p>
<p>-Hey. Are you also inside the barrier?</p>
<p>At that moment, Chae Nayun’s voice flowed into my ears through Infinite Communication.</p>
<p>Her voice sounded clear, which meant she was not far from here.</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>I opened my eyes wide and looked around.</p>
<p>It was then that I realized what situation I was in.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah, Chae Nayun, Kim Youngjin, Yohei, Kim Horak, Yi Youngjin, Airun and her knights, the Republic’s aristocratic knights, and even civilians armed with shabby swords and sickles.</p>
<p>Everyone was fighting Baal’s monsters fiercely.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I looked at Jain, then at Shimurin. Both were smiling mischievously. Jain whispered to me.</p>
<p>‘We have a lot of time.’</p>
<p>-Okay, listen. If you’re here, you need to help us out. You’re good at this kind of fight. There’s just too many of them. It’s endless….</p>
<p>At that moment, I heard Chae Nayun’s nervous voice again.</p>
<p>I smiled and put my bow back in Stigma. Then I pulled out the Desert Eagle.</p>
<p>“Well then.”</p>
<p>I had plenty of bullets on me, including the Basilisk’s bullets.</p>
<p>I transformed the Desert Eagle into a heavy machine gun.</p>
<p><em>Kiik- kiik-</em> The sound of machine parts colliding rang out.</p>
<p>The Desert Eagle became a machine gun the size of a cannonball, with its muzzle pointed to the sky.</p>
<p>It had been quite a while since I last let the Desert Eagle take the form of a machine gun. Perhaps due to my growth, the gun looked much more intimidating now than before.</p>
<p>The bullets fired from a gun of this size would be as powerful as a bomb that could blow up anything.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk after we take care of this.”</p>
<p>But before pulling the trigger, I first sent a message to Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>-It’s me who’s shooting now.</p>
<p>A sentence as simple as that.</p>
<p>Then I quickly pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 340. The Stories of the Characters (6)</p>
<p>[Republic of Leores]</p>
<p>“…Whew.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun heaved out a sigh. Seeing this, the children surrounding her began to cry. They were standing on remnants of a crumbled building. Nearby, a wooden plaque reading [Orphanage] lied on the ground.</p>
<p>“Um….”</p>
<p>One of the children approached Chae Nayun with shaking legs. The child tried to say something.</p>
<p><em>Krrrr!</em></p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>However, she soon fell flat on the ground, hearing the low growl of a demonic beast.</p>
<p>“…Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun reassured the children as she turned around. A wolf-like demonic beast, an octopus-like demonic beast, and an 8-handed humanoid demonic beast were eyeing her with killing intent.</p>
<p>“Older Sis here will protect you all.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun split off a part of her magic power and created a protective barrier around the children. As creating barriers wasn’t her specialty, her magic power consumption shot up. Still, she knew it was better than having someone get injured.</p>
<p>—Krrrr!</p>
<p>The wolf demonic beast shot forward. Chae Nayun swung her sword at its head, cleanly severing it in half.</p>
<p>—U-Uwoah!</p>
<p>—Y-You can do it!</p>
<p>The children inside the barrier cheered as soon as she cut down one demonic beast. Just hearing them gave her a boost of energy, but it was then that more annoying monsters appeared.</p>
<p>—Kieeeeek!</p>
<p>A loud screech descended from the sky. Chae Nayun quickly tilted her head up.</p>
<p>—Kieeek!</p>
<p>—Kieeek!</p>
<p>Dozens, no, hundreds of flying demonic beasts were gathering around her.</p>
<p>“…I’m not good at aerial battle.”</p>
<p>To fight airborne monsters, Chae Nayun had to infuse more magic power into her sword to increase the length of its blade. Although that wasn’t difficult in itself, she was worried about the children. If she accidentally swung her blade in the wrong direction, she could very well destroy the barrier and even kill the children inside.</p>
<p>—We believe in you!</p>
<p>—Don’t die!</p>
<p>The heartwarming encouragement of the children seemed to invite the demonic birds.</p>
<p>—Kieeek!</p>
<p>With loud screeches, they shot down.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun gathered her magic power in Balmung and swung it in a large arc. Balmung’s blade spread out like a fan and obliterated everything in its path.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>Something shot up from the ground in the distance. Without a sound, it left behind a curved line marking its path. No matter how she looked at it, she could only think of gunfire from a certain man.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>After a moment of silence, a thunderous clap boomed out. The sound of gunfire had arrived a bit after its firing.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>The line left behind by the flying object soon forked into multiple paths. Seeing this, Chae Nayun realized multiple bullets had been fired simultaneously. The bullets traveled faster than sound. It was only after they pierced the demonic beasts that the impact sound rang out.</p>
<p>“…Whew.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun pierced the ground with Balmung and leaned against it. Although she was still surrounded by demonic beasts, her intuition told her that her 24-hour-long battle was coming to an end.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>The pouring bullets decimated the demonic beasts, both in the sky and on the ground. For some strange reason, the bullets seemed to have a mind of their own, as they curved freely and struck down countless targets.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun breathed a sigh of relief. She knew that this ally of hers never missed his mark. She was convinced she could finally rest.</p>
<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun dismantled her barrier and gathered the children. The children were initially trembling in fear from the seemingly indiscriminate shooting, but it didn’t take long for them to realize that wasn’t the case. Chae Nayun fell flat on the ground and collected her breath.</p>
<p>“Let’s rest a bit.”</p>
<p>The children hugged each other and closed their eyes. Chae Nayun sat in the center of the group, gently stroking their hair and reassuring them.</p>
<p>30 minutes later…</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>The endless barrage of bullets stopped, and a timely gust of wind tickled Chae Nayun’s shoulders.</p>
<p>She looked up and gazed at the sky. Although it was still dark from Baal’s barrier, there wasn’t a single demonic beast remaining.</p>
<p>“…It’s over.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun chuckled. The never-ending battle she had been wrapped up in all day ended in just 30 minutes. She couldn’t help but praise Kim Hajin’s Gift.</p>
<p>—Is it over?</p>
<p>Chae Nayun messaged Kim Hajin to ask for a confirmation. A reply came back about a minute later.</p>
<p>—Yeah, more or less.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun closed her eyes and grinned.</p>
<p>She could hear the breathing noises of the children in her arms. She looked down, feeling a great sense of achievement. Protecting them was hard, but she had to admit it was well worth it.</p>
<p>—…Hey.</p>
<p>—What’s up?</p>
<p>As her heart rate slowed down from exhaustion, Chae Nayun sent another message.</p>
<p>—Thanks.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin didn’t respond right away. A long silence continued before a few words finally came back.</p>
<p>—Don’t say that.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun laughed at his words. She knew what he meant by those words. Like a fool, the Kim Hajin she knew always saw himself as someone to be hated.</p>
<p>So, Chae Nayun didn’t say anything back.</p>
<p>Seeing the tired children sleeping in her arms, remembering the people she saved during the day, and recalling the people who lost their lives, she felt like she could finally understand it.</p>
<p>If Kim Hajin didn’t kill Chae Jinyoon that day, he would have become a devil and killed countless people. Chae Jinyoon would have been forced to commit murder, never to find salvation.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun understood all this. But she didn’t voice it aloud. Instead, she changed the topic.</p>
<p>—Where are you going now?</p>
<p>—…Isn’t that obvious? For both of us, I mean.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun nodded at Kim Hajin’s reply. The final target was the villain behind the appearance of devils on Earth – Baal.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>—That Baal bastard, the one who’s responsible for the rift between us, let’s storm into his castle and beat him up.</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Chae Nayun’s ears perked up.</p>
<p>“…Huh? What?”</p>
<p>She heard a voice from far, far away. It wasn’t a Mental Transmission or a mystical message like the one from Infinite Communication. It was a real voice, albeit faint.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun quickly turned to the east. She could see the rubble of a crumbled building in the far distance.</p>
<p>Her intuition roared.</p>
<p>It was telling her that Kim Hajin was there. That he wouldn’t run away if she came to him. That he couldn’t….</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun smirked. She grinned from ear to ear before turning back to look at the children she rescued.</p>
<p>“I’m going to sleep before heading there, so go on ahead.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin didn’t reply. It was only obvious since she said it aloud without messaging him. In any case, Chae Nayun lied down on the ground with a thin smile. Lying comfortably, she looked up at the sky darkened by Baal’s barrier and murmured to herself.</p>
<p>“…I’m thankful but I can’t thank you. I like you, but I can’t like you. It’s still like that for me.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon and Cheok Jungyeong arrived at the waiting room of the Colosseum. Vassago’s servant personally guided them. A fancy table and a set of luxurious chairs were placed inside it, and Jin Seyeon and Cheok Jungyeong immediately grabbed a seat.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>When Jin Seyeon sat on the chair, she exclaimed in surprise. The way the chair comfortably hugged her lower body was something she had never experienced before.</p>
<p>“Lord Vassago is a renowned collector. Every item our guests see and use are masterpieces in their own fields.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon let out a dry cough, somewhat embarrassed by her subconscious outburst, but Cheok Jungyeong only laughed disdainfully.</p>
<p>“Way to act high and mighty with such cheap furniture. The stuff we have in our hideout is thousands of times better.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong only meant to make a snarky remark, but it was something the servant couldn’t overlook. His expression contorted viciously, his shoulders shook, and his stomach boiled with anger.</p>
<p>He felt a strong urge to kill Cheok Jungyeong on the spot, but he barely held himself back, knowing his Lord would dislike his challengers disappearing.</p>
<p>“Please refrain from telling such lies. This Colosseum is under our Lord’s control. He can be watching you if he so wishes.”</p>
<p>“I’m not lying, you hunchback weasel. Have you been to our hideout? Have you sat in our chairs or lay in our beds?”</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe’s hideout was full of furniture crafted by Kim Hajin. From Cheok Jungyeong’s perspective, Kim Hajin’s furniture was far better than the ones he saw and felt here.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The servant became speechless. Jin Seyeon spotted fury from his cold expression and quickly blocked Cheok Jungyeong’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Ahem, thank you for guiding us.”</p>
<p>Even so, the servant didn’t stop glaring at Cheok Jungyeong. Of course, Cheok Jungyeong wasn’t the type to shy away from a battle, much less a staring contest. He looked back at the servant and smiled proudly. In his mind, he was only thinking of relieving his boredom by fighting.</p>
<p>—Let it go.</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice rang out from the ceiling, startling both Jin Seyeon and Cheok Jungyeong. The servant immediately retracted his anger and knelt down.</p>
<p>“My apologies, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong looked up at the ceiling. The voice rang out once more from the same place.</p>
<p>—What you said catches my interest. Every item in my possession is of the finest quality. You say that they are lacking?</p>
<p>Vassago wasn’t as perverted a collector as Baal, but as a devil who specialized in discovering treasures, what Cheok Jungyeong said caught his interest.</p>
<p>“I’m saying that the stuff we have in our hideout is better.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong spoke with confidence. The servant jumped in shock, while Vassago remained silent.</p>
<p>Of course, Cheok Jungyeong’s confidence was only natural given the origin of the Chameleon Troupe’s furniture. Dwarves were one of the rarest races and the race with the best craftsmanship. Vassago’s journey across many dimensions had allowed him to obtain several dwarven items, but he only possessed ‘weapons’. This was because the dwarves were known to only craft weapons.</p>
<p>“Rather than that, your voice is more feminine than I expected.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong put aside talking about furniture. He was more curious about Vassago’s gender. Hearing the silvery voice that rang out from the ceiling, he could only guess that Vassago was a woman.</p>
<p>—…Devils don’t have genders. Rather, it depends on the incarnation body. If you are talking about now, I am indeed a woman.</p>
<p>Vassago answered. Although she talked like she was being generous, the discontent in her voice was clear.</p>
<p>—In any case, I would love to see the furniture in your hideout. If you can get out of here alive, that is.</p>
<p>“Kuhahaha. Great, I’ll personally bring your head to the hideout and show you around.”</p>
<p>—…Good. I hope that confidence isn’t just coming from the natural arrogance of humans.</p>
<p>With that, Vassago’s voice cut off. Vassago’s servant sent Cheok Jungyeong one last glare before leaving as well.</p>
<p>“…It looks like our theory is correct.”</p>
<p>As soon as they vanished, Jin Seyeon muttered in a serious tone.</p>
<p>“What theory?”</p>
<p>“That devils are naturally more obsessed with things than humans. If you think about it, Djinns are humans who were influenced by devils to pursue their desires. In that case, devils should be the incarnation of desire.”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong asked with a frown. Jin Seyeon clenched her fists and gazed at Cheok Jungyeong. She sent him a Mental Transmission in case Vassago was listening.</p>
<p>—It means it might be possible to defeat devils without fighting them. All types of tricks can be used.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Baal’s Devil Castle]</p>
<p>Kim Suho entered the Devil’s Castle. The first floor of Baal’s castle only consisted of stairs. Despite the eerie atmosphere, there were no traps or obstacles, so rather than worrying about enemies, Kim Suho eyed Jin Sahyuk who was technically his ally.</p>
<p>After about 20 minutes…</p>
<p>“Do you have a plan for killing Baal?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk suddenly asked. Kim Suho flinched at the unexpected question before letting out a cough and answering seriously.</p>
<p>“…I’ll cut him down. That’s it for now.”</p>
<p>They only had two days left, which wasn’t enough to form a detailed plan. Kim Suho simply believed in himself and his sword, Misteltein.</p>
<p>“What about you? Do you have a plan?”</p>
<p>Aileen asked from next to them. She was floating in the air with the help of her Spirit Speech, mainly because she wanted to stay at their eye level. Jin Sahyuk suddenly stopped. Her pause caught Kim Suho, Aileen, and Shin Jonghak’s attention.</p>
<p>“…You do? Then tell us.”</p>
<p>Seeing Jin Sahyuk remaining mute, Aileen urged her. Jin Sahyuk looked back and forth between Kim Suho and Aileen.</p>
<p>“I’m going to ask Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho, Aileen, and Shin Jonghak all shook with shock. Shin Jonghak made a dissatisfied face, while Kim Suho and Aileen looked curious more than anything.</p>
<p>Aileen asked, “You’re going to ask him? How?”</p>
<p>“When I send the signal, he will fire an arrow at the Devil’s Castle. If it’s him, he should be able to destroy the entire Devil’s Castle.”</p>
<p>“W-What? You think that’s possible? Even my Teleportation didn’t work inside this castle. That’s why we’re running up, remember? And if that was possible, why are we even climbing it in the first place? We can just wait for Black Lotus to destroy the castle and….”</p>
<p>“Quiet. I know he’s capable. He will destroy the castle from the outside, but we have to take care of what’s inside.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stood steadfast in the face of Aileen’s sarcastic comments.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kim Suho kept staring at Jin Sahyuk. He couldn’t understand why Jin Sahyuk trusted Black Lotus so much. In fact, he couldn’t understand how Jin Sahyuk trusted anyone at all.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk, what’s your relationship with Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>He asked a logical question.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>But to his surprise, Jin Sahyuk acted mad, muttering, “Kim Suho, you bastard, you’ve grown arrogant!”</p>
<p>However, in the next moment, she smirked like it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>“Actually, rather than Black Lotus, I have a relationship with Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho immediately became lost for words. He was so shocked that he couldn’t speak. Kim Suho wasn’t sure whether he heard what he thought he just heard. But before he could carefully go over what was just said, Jin Sahyuk added even more provocative info.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin has complicated feelings for me, so much so that it’s troubling even for me.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a complete lie taking the ‘Synchronization’ into account. It was also true that Kim Hajin’s ‘complicated feelings’ were ‘troubling’ her.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk’s words were more effective than she imagined. This time, even Shin Jonghak and Aileen’s heads turned blank.</p>
<p>“That’s all I’m saying. Is that so surprising~?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk chuckled to herself and began climbing the stairs once more. This time, her steps were more poised and elegant.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 341. Final Banquet (1)</p>
<p>[Baal’s Castle]</p>
<p>Kim Suho continued to climb a seemingly endless spiral staircase. As he grew closer to the sky, he continuously mulled over what Jin Sahyuk said two hours ago.</p>
<p>‘Kim Hajin has complicated feelings for me, so much so that it’s troubling even for me.’</p>
<p>‘If you knew how Kim Hajin feels, you would all be shocked speechless….’</p>
<p>Unable to understand what she meant, Kim Suho called Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“Shin Jonghak, do you know anything about it?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“About what Jin Sahyuk said.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak shook his head.</p>
<p>“No clue. I only followed her here…. But I’ve seen that woman stare at Kim Hajin with a warm look.”</p>
<p>“What? Really?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it, Suho. I’m sure she’s lying. Why would Fenrir like that crazy woman anyways?”</p>
<p>Aileen cut in.</p>
<p>To be honest, Kim Suho thought the same way. But he knew Jin Sahyuk wasn’t the type to make such jokes. She considered herself as royalty, and joking was something that didn’t suit their dignity.</p>
<p>“Rather than that, I’m curious when we’ll reach the end of this staircase.”</p>
<p>Aileen crossed her arms unhappily. Just as she said, the group had been climbing the staircase for almost three hours, but they had yet to catch a glimpse of anything resembling a pathway.</p>
<p>“…Oi! Black haired girl!”</p>
<p>Aileen called Jin Sahyuk, who was climbing ahead of them. Jin Sahyuk stopped and looked back at Aileen.</p>
<p>“Are you sure we’re going the right way?”</p>
<p>“…Who knows?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shrugged irresponsibly.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Aileen scowled, to which Jin Sahyuk smirked.</p>
<p>“What other choice do we have? It’s not like we can shout for Baal to come out. Let’s just keep going, and in the meanwhile, I’ll send a Mental Transmission to Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>“…Mental Transmission? To Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk nodded and sent a Mental Transmission to Kim Hajin. Her way of sending Mental Transmissions was rather unique, as she used ‘Reality Manipulation’ to do so.</p>
<p>—I’m in Baal’s castle with Kim Suho. You stay outside. Don’t enter the castle. If you want to save the world, then do as I say.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin replied about three minutes afterward.</p>
<p>—…Why?</p>
<p>It was a short, blunt question. Jin Sahyuk laughed inwardly at this cute reaction. Behind her, Aileen’s loud voice rang out.</p>
<p>“Cmon-! How long do we have to keep—”</p>
<p>“Oh, there it is.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk interrupted Aileen and pointed to a spot on the spiral staircase. Shin Jonghak, Kim Suho, and Aileen all turned their gazes to the spot Jin Sahyuk was pointing to.</p>
<p>“…Huh? You’re right. It really is there. But there wasn’t anything just a moment ago.”</p>
<p>Aileen’s eyes widened. Just like she said, a huge gate had suddenly appeared at a previously empty spot.</p>
<p>“…I’ll go in first.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak stepped forward as soon as he saw the gate. He hopped up the staircase, three steps at a time until he reached the gate. Seeing how Shin Jonghak was practically running, Jin Sahyuk smiled.</p>
<p>Soon, all four members of the group reached the gate. Standing in front of the ogre-sized gate, Shin Jonghak stared at Jin Sahyuk, and Jin Sahyuk nodded her head. Shin Jonghak then grabbed the knob on the right side while Kim Suho grabbed the knob on the left. Together, they pushed it forward.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>The giant gate opened with a course sound. Immediately, a brilliant light shone from the other side, and classical music began to play. The four of them blinked their eyes at the dazzling light, and in the next instant, their thought processes stopped.</p>
<p>A scene they hadn’t expected to see was spread out before them.</p>
<p>“…Where is this?”</p>
<p>Aileen muttered quietly and rolled her eyes to study the area. To describe it simply, they were at the scene of a ‘banquet’. A fancy chandelier cast light in all directions, and a sumptuous feast was prepared inside. They could also see well-dressed men and women dancing to the tune of classical music.</p>
<p>No matter how they looked at it, they were in a banquet hall.</p>
<p>“…There he is.”</p>
<p>While the others stood confused, Jin Sahyuk spotted a certain person from the crowd and smiled.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak also followed Jin Sahyuk’s gaze, while Aileen’s attention was caught by a waiter holding a plate of fancy chocolates.</p>
<p>“That’s Yi Yeonjun, the previous boss of the Chameleon Troupe.”</p>
<p>The moment Jin Sahyuk mentioned this…</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Aileen’s eyes shot open, and her attention turned to Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“That bastard… he’s really alive?”</p>
<p>Aileen also had an ill-fated relationship with Yi Yeonjun. Currently, he was sitting on a chair at a balcony on the upper floor of the banquet hall, looking down at the crowd below.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Demon Realm Gate – Baal’s Barrier]</p>
<p>I stood in front of Baal’s castle. Jain and Shimurin were standing next to me. Although I used up most of my bullets, I eliminated all the demonic beasts running amok inside the barrier. Soon, Rachel, Yun Seung-Ah, and the other Heroes should arrive here as well.</p>
<p>“Let’s go in.”</p>
<p>Just as I was about to enter Baal’s castle…</p>
<p>—I’m in Baal’s castle with Kim Suho. You stay outside. Don’t enter the castle. If you want to save the world, then do as I say.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s Mental Transmission flowed into my ears. I paused immediately.</p>
<p>“…Hm? What’s up~?”</p>
<p>Jain tilted her head curiously.</p>
<p>“Uh… hold on, I just got a strange message.”</p>
<p>I messaged back.</p>
<p>—Why?</p>
<p>But she didn’t return an answer. After waiting for a few minutes, I contemplated ignoring her warning and going inside. I gave it more thought and concluded that the changed Jin Sahyuk wouldn’t lie to me.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait a bit more.”</p>
<p>I spread Aether out like a mat and took a seat on the ground. Jain and Shimurin also sat down next to me. Jain yawned, and Shimurin took out a scroll as soon as she sat down.</p>
<p>“Is that the dimension scroll?”</p>
<p>I looked at her scroll with keen interest. Shimurin nodded her head with a grin.</p>
<p>“This scroll will summon a portal connecting two dimensions together. It’s still incomplete and unsafe. The portal isn’t big enough either. There’s still a lot I have to fix… Why? Do you want to give it a go?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I stared at the scroll fixedly. Then, a brilliant idea flashed across my mind.</p>
<p>“Let me test something.”</p>
<p>I took out two A4-sized pieces of paper. Shimurin tilted her head and asked.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“They’re just pieces of paper for now….”</p>
<p>I activated Setting Intervention, adding [Linkage], [Recording], and [Durability] to their setting. I also changed the name of the papers to ‘Messenger’.</p>
<p>[You used 103SP to change the setting of a set of objects.]</p>
<p>[Luck activates.]</p>
<p>[Item, ‘Messenger’, increases in rank.]</p>
<p>[Item, ‘Messenger’, has been strengthened in functionality.]</p>
<p>“Now it’s a messenger.”</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>Shimurin’s eyebrows went up, and Jain turned her gaze to us with interest.</p>
<p>“A messenger. If you write something on one paper, the same thing will be written on the other.”</p>
<p>I demonstrated the Messenger’s function. Shimurin nodded her head.</p>
<p>“So that’s what it is. You want to send this to your world?”</p>
<p>“Exactly.”</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>Shimurin rubbed her chin and fell in thought. After about 30 seconds, she continued.</p>
<p>“It’s likely that the paper will burn while crossing over to your world.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. This paper has good durability.”</p>
<p>At the very least, it should withstand being burnt. I added [Durability] to its setting, not to mention the added bonus from luck.</p>
<p>“You’re that confident? This scroll might look tiny, but it’s expensive enough to be a national treasure you know?”</p>
<p>“Just do it. Who cares about money when the world is at risk?”</p>
<p>“…Well, that’s true.”</p>
<p>Shimurin let out a dry cough and tore the scroll in half. The grand magician’s magic power flowed into the scroll, and a small, fist-sized portal appeared in the air.</p>
<p>“Alright, Kim Hajin, it’s your turn now.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>I sent Stigma’s magic power into the portal and set the coordinate to Evandel’s cabin.</p>
<p>“Done. I’m going to give it a go then.”</p>
<p>I wrote a message on the paper, folded it into a paper airplane, and sent it flying inside the portal. With my Master Sharpshooter Gift, the paper airplane practically flew like a real one.</p>
<p>“Wow~ how cool~ so we just have to wait now~?”</p>
<p>Jain muttered, but Shimurin and I only stared at the remaining paper.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>—We just found Yi Yeonjun in what seems to be the first stage, a ‘banquet hall’. You wait outside and destroy Baal’s castle with an arrow when I give the signal. I know you can do it.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk returned a belated reply.</p>
<p>“What is she talking about?”</p>
<p>I spat out a complaint out loud. When Shimurin and Jain gave me a curious look, I returned a reply.</p>
<p>—Are you crazy? How am I supposed to destroy Baal’s castle?</p>
<p>—You can do it.</p>
<p>—No way.</p>
<p>It was impossible, especially when even Baal’s barrier could only be partially destroyed with the help of the ‘Mystic Key’.</p>
<p>…Wait. Mystic Key?</p>
<p>—You should be able to do it. So when I give the signal, shoot immediately and destroy the castle.</p>
<p>Ignoring my worries, Jin Sahyuk gave a firm command.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Earth – ♡Evandel and Hayang’s Cabin♡]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ah Hae-In and Evandel returned to Evandel’s ‘domain’.</p>
<p>“TV, TV~”</p>
<p>Evandel hummed happily as she turned on the TV inside the cabin.</p>
<p>—Valac’s army retreated from Europe.</p>
<p>A timely report of the day’s news came out.</p>
<p>—Duchess Ah Hae-In and her disciple led humanity to their first victory.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In and Evandel had successfully stopped Valac’s army from advancing into Europe. Evandel and her unicorn commanded 5000 spirit beasts as though they shared one mind, while Ah Hae-In fully utilized the power of the Cardinal Guardians to force Valac to retreat.</p>
<p>—The streets of Europe are filled with people cheering the two magicians’ achievements….</p>
<p>“Oooh, look Hayang, we did good~”</p>
<p>Evandel watched the news with sparkling eyes. Seeing her achievements broadcasted across the world, she was both excited and proud.</p>
<p>—We captured footage of a black wolf defeating Valac’s adjutant. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>“…Fenrir, Fenrir, come over here! They’re praising you on TV!”</p>
<p>Evandel hugged Fenrir excitedly. Fenrir maintained his indifferent act while stealthily gazing at himself appearing on TV.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>A house-sized wolf was storming forward and crushing several demons.</p>
<p>“So cool!”</p>
<p>—Krrr.</p>
<p>Fenrir shrugged hearing Evandel’s cheer.</p>
<p>“…Haha.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In chuckled and left Evandel to enjoy her time with her spirit beasts. Then, she turned on her smartwatch, which she kept off during the war.</p>
<p>She was immediately stormed with messages from the Association.</p>
<p>[Demon Realm Gate – Kim Suho, Aileen, Yun Seung-Ah, Shin Jonghak, Rachel, Yoo Yeonha, and others]</p>
<p>[Valac – Ah Hae-In]</p>
<p>[Leraje – Game to be released next Monday]</p>
<p>[Astaroth – Leore, Kim Hwaoong, Yi Heejoon, and 13 other 8-star magicians]</p>
<p>[Vassago’s Colosseum – Jin Seyeon, Vast Expanse, and others]</p>
<p>She received a report containing the activities of various Heroes. Ah Hae-In found the name ‘Rachel’ on the list and looked back at Evandel.</p>
<p>Evandel was clapping her hands like a seal and watching the news with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“…Cute.”</p>
<p>A faint smile emerged on Ah Hae-In’s face. She became worried when both Kim Hajin and Rachel left, but it seemed that her worry was unnecessary.</p>
<p><em>Tiriring—!</em></p>
<p>As she was watching Evandel play with her friends, she received another message.</p>
<p>[Duchess Ah Hae-In, when will you introduce your disciple to the world? Everyone is curious. Earth needs an icon of hope.]</p>
<p>It was from the Association yet again. In truth, the Hero Association already knew who Ah Hae-In’s disciple was, that it was a young girl of the name ‘Evandel’.</p>
<p>That was why they kept pestering her. A ten-year-old genius magician who could wield an army of spirit beasts. Evandel was truly the perfect candidate for an ‘icon of hope’.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In ignored the message and turned her smartwatch off. At that moment, a paper airplane flew inside the cabin from the window.</p>
<p>“What’s this…?”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In frowned and grabbed the airplane. When she touched it, her face immediately stiffened. She could feel a trace of magic power from the paper material.</p>
<p>She quickly opened the airplane and checked the contents.</p>
<p>[Evandel, are you doing well? It’s me, Hajin. If you have something you want to say to me, all you have to do is write something on this piece of paper. I can reply to you on the same paper. I want to see you.]</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>It was, without doubt, a message from Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 342. Final Banquet (2)</p>
<p>[Leores – Underground Bunker]</p>
<p>Rachel, Yun Seung-Ah, Chae Nayun, and other members from Earth returned to the underground bunker. When they arrived, they were met with cheers from the people staying in it. Airun and the Republic’s knights smiled wryly as they shook hands with evacuees. The group then headed to the office of the person in charge of the bunker – Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha greeted them and said as she looked back and forth between the knights and the members of the Secret Service.</p>
<p>“There’s too many of you to be stuffed in this small place.”</p>
<p>Six Secret Service members and twenty-six knights had entered the room. There were also hundreds of knights waiting outside.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Airun sent her subordinates a shooing look. The Knights took the hint and left the room, leaving behind Rachel, Chae Nayun, Airun, Kim Youngjin, Yi Yeonghan, and Kim Horak.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha wasn’t happy that an outsider like Airun was still in the room, but she greeted her with a smile knowing she was an important character in this world.</p>
<p>“Well done, everyone. But we don’t have time to rest. Next, we—”</p>
<p>“Where’s Kim Suho?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun interrupted Yoo Yeonha to ask.</p>
<p>“Did he go to the bathroom?”</p>
<p>She blinked her eyes with an innocent look. Yoo Yeonha coughed before replying immediately.</p>
<p>“He went to Baal’s castle with Lady Aileen.”</p>
<p>“What? Already?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Fenrir was going to end the war with demonic beasts anyways.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha made a faint smile. It was the objective truth that Kim Hajin performed the best in war. Although Kim Suho could cut down dozens of enemies with one swing of his sword, Kim Hajin could kill hundreds just by the click of a button.</p>
<p>“Sorry, but where’s our Prince!?”</p>
<p>Airun shouted urgently as if she was tired of hearing about Fenrir, Baal, and whatnot. Yoo Yeonha stared at Airun before taking out seventeen small bottles from her desk drawer.</p>
<p>“There’s a large castle in the middle of the barrier. We call it Baal’s castle. The Prince is probably there. Here, take this.”</p>
<p>“…Miracle herbs?”</p>
<p>Rachel muttered silently when she saw the plants inside the bottles. She could feel the energy of elementals from the plants.</p>
<p>“That’s right. We looked all over the country and could only find seventeen of them. Taking it will recover your energy within 2~3 hours.”</p>
<p>In other words, she wanted them to get going as soon as possible. It wasn’t the most encouraging words to hear for people who just returned from hours upon hours of battle, but they knew the situation they were in. The seven of them took the bottles and consumed the herbs. Then, they put the remaining ten bottles in their pockets.</p>
<p>“Give some to Kim Suho and Aileen when you meet them. They left before I had the chance to give them out. The rest, you can use in times of emergency.”</p>
<p>As she said that, Yoo Yeonha took out a suitcase and put it on the desk. Then, she took out several more. <em>Koong- koong- koong- koong-</em> She took out a total of seven suitcases, and the seven members stared at Yoo Yeonha curiously.</p>
<p>“These are treasures used for exorcism. I kind of stole them from their original owners, but that’s not important now. Use them when you reach the castle.”</p>
<p>The seven members hesitated. Using stolen goods was one thing, but they were just too hungry.</p>
<p>“Hurry. There are other people I have to talk to. This bunker has over 200 people. I’m busy trying to take care of everything. Your hunger should disappear too when you consume the miracle herb.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha urged the Heroes, practically forcing them out with suitcases in hand.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Baal’s Castle – Banquet Hall]</p>
<p>“Shoot.”</p>
<p><em>Tk-</em> The toes of two people clashed. Aileen furrowed her brows, but Kim Suho took the next step with tenacity.</p>
<p>“Damn it. Argh.”</p>
<p>But not long afterward, their feet tangled once more. High-class music flowed in the air, but the two people’s minds were all over the place. Even so, they continued to dance.</p>
<p>Aileen grit her teeth and asked, “Why do I have to do this?”</p>
<p>“..Just wait until they’re done talking.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho glanced at the second floor of the banquet hall. There, Yi Yeonjun was staring at Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“Agh, when is it ending….”</p>
<p>For the record, there was a reason Aileen and Kim Suho were dancing. Baal’s castle had ‘rules’ that had to be followed. Other than Jin Sahyuk who could manipulate reality and Shin Jonghak who was unaffected for some reason, everyone who didn’t follow the rules was kicked out.</p>
<p>“Sh, be quiet, so we can eavesdrop.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho danced half-heartedly and focused his attention on the second floor. Jin Sahyuk and Yi Yeonjun met face to face just a moment ago.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spoke, “We meet again.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s eyes narrowed like those of a fox.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>However, Yi Yeonjun remained silent and simply looked back and forth between Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak. From the look in his eyes, he seemed confused.</p>
<p>Soon, he spoke up.</p>
<p>“Looks like Baal’s rules don’t apply to you.”</p>
<p>“…I have my Authority, but I don’t know why it doesn’t work on him.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk pointed at Shin Jonghak, who was completely unaffected by Baal’s rules.</p>
<p>“Hm, you’re an interesting one.” Yi Yeonjun said to Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Immediately, Shin Jonghak swung his Conqueror Spear. The spear cut through the air and stopped right in front of Yi Yeonjun’s neck.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak asked, “Answer. Where’s Baal?”</p>
<p>“Baal is raging.”</p>
<p>A rather random reply came back. Shin Jonghak frowned, and Jin Sahyuk immediately asked back.</p>
<p>“We asked where Baal is, not what he’s doing.”</p>
<p>“He’s raging.”</p>
<p>“Is your head okay…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk paused for a moment and stared at Yi Yeonjun fixedly.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Something seemed off about Yi Yeonjun. His eyes were murky, and his body didn’t move. Almost like someone who lost something important, he sat dazed in his chair.</p>
<p>“…Baal’s raging?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked somewhat seriously. She wanted to grasp the situation accurately. Yi Yeonjun didn’t wait to answer Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Baal saw the truth from Bell’s memories.”</p>
<p>“Truth? What truth?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun tilted his head and looked at Jin Sahyuk. However, Jin Sahyuk couldn’t look at him straight. She preferred his old, greed-filled eyes rather than the current hollow eyes.</p>
<p>“Did you know?” Yi Yeonjun asked. Jin Sahyuk looked at Shin Jonghak before answering, and when Shin Jonghak shook his head, she looked back at Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“Know what?”</p>
<p>“That this world we live in is nothing but a novel.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows, but that was the only change in her expression. She couldn’t make sense of what Yi Yeonjun said, so she couldn’t react in a big way.</p>
<p>“So you didn’t know either.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was serious. With a twisted smile, he began to murmur incomprehensible things.</p>
<p>“But Bell knew. He knew that this world is a novel written by a single man…. That’s right, a novel. A damn novel and a worthless one at that. The world I wanted to obtain so much wasn’t worth a penny to ‘that man’. Even the almighty devil is nothing but a creation of a magicless ‘complete world’….”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun continued to mumble as if he had lost his mind. Jin Sahyuk tried to pick up on any clues she could find, but in the end, she gave up and sighed.</p>
<p>“Fool, it looks like Baal ate your brain. This is what you get for being too greedy and trying to obtain what’s out of your league.”</p>
<p>“Out of my league… that’s right. A mere character like myself dared to take over a world….”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk gathered magic power in her hands. She tried to kill Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>It was then. Bell’s face suddenly popped up in her mind. Before he died, he said he knew ‘two’ truths, but he died while keeping one of them to himself.</p>
<p>That truth most certainly would have flowed into Baal’s head. As a curious devil, there was no doubt Baal would absorb the memories of his host.</p>
<p>“…Oi.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk retracted her magic power and looked into Yi Yeonjun’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Tell me slowly and in detail. What did you hear from Baal? No matter what he found out, he couldn’t possibly fear anything.”</p>
<p>“Baal is raging.”</p>
<p>“No, there is no human who is afraid of an ant. Rage is just another form of fear.”</p>
<p>Some people might detest ants, but no one was angry at them. Similarly, there was no reason for Baal to be angry at humans.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yi Yeonjun closed his eyes and opened them back up. Jin Sahyuk’s stiffened face was right in front of him.</p>
<p>“Fine, if you want to hear it so much, I’ll tell you….”</p>
<p>With a straight face, Yi Yeonjun began to describe the memories he ‘received’ from Baal.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Outside Baal’s Castle]</p>
<p>—Hajin? It’s really you, Hajin?</p>
<p>Evandel replied. I immediately wrote back.</p>
<p>—Of course, it’s me. Have you been doing well? Duchess Ah Hae-In is treating you well, right?</p>
<p>—Un! This is really cool. How did you get this to work?</p>
<p>Evandel’s handwriting was neat and clean. Seeing how much she grew up, I held back my tears.</p>
<p>—I made it, but a magician in this world helped me send it over.</p>
<p>At that moment, the magician in question spoke.</p>
<p>“How interesting. I didn’t think it would work so well.”</p>
<p>Her face didn’t show any sign of happiness or pride.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you happy?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like I did much. I only brought a scroll without a destination. You’re the one who completed it in an absurd fashion. I didn’t see you make any calculations. I didn’t even see what you did to modify the scroll.”</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>I scratched the back of my neck. I didn’t have much to say to that. That was just how Stigma was. The co-author said it was a special authority of the Creator… though I could barely call myself the Creator at this point.</p>
<p>“Anyways, you helped prove something I wasn’t sure of. That dimensional travel is possible. I can cross dimensions and go to another world….”</p>
<p>While Shimurin was murmuring, I felt a group of people approaching us. I turned my head in that direction.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Rachel, Yun Seung-Ah, Chae Nayun, Yi Yeonghan… People I was familiar with were walking over with exorcist weapons. I quickly put on Black Lotus’s hood and mask and then took out the Black Lotus Bow.</p>
<p>“…Be careful Jain. Those guys are coming.”</p>
<p>“Hm, who should I turn into…?”</p>
<p>Jain pondered for a moment before turning into Cheok Jungyeong. She flexed her hulk-like muscles and looked at me.</p>
<p>“How is it~?”</p>
<p>Jain grinned sweetly with Cheok Jungyeong’s face. I held myself back from puking.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk and smile like that when you’re in that form…”</p>
<p>“Ah, sure~ sure~”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and the others arrived a bit afterward. They stopped running when they saw us.</p>
<p>“…What are you guys doing here?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah was the first to speak. Behind her, Rachel and Chae Nayun looked at us suspiciously. Jain then gave the same arrogant smile Cheok Jungyeong often made.</p>
<p>“Nothing much. Are you trying to enter this castle too?”</p>
<p>“Oi, fat boar, who’s that next to you?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun asked as she glared at me. Jain shrugged as if the answer was obvious.</p>
<p>“It’s Blackie. Can’t you see?”</p>
<p>I grabbed my bow to emphasize my identity. But suddenly, everyone else picked up their weapons and stood on guard.</p>
<p>“W-Why are you raising your bow? Put it down!”</p>
<p>“Do you want to fight?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah's hostile voice rang out, and Rachel’s elementals flickered in the air.</p>
<p>I felt a strong urge to reveal my true identity, but I forced it down. Until everything ends, no, even after everything ends, I had to be Black Lotus.</p>
<p>I spoke, “You can go in. Your friends are inside. We have no desire to hinder you.”</p>
<p>My mask changed my voice. I made another [Messenger] with Setting Intervention and threw it to Yun Seung-Ah. The paper flew faster than a bullet, but Yun Seung-Ah easily caught it with her fingers.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“It will let you contact me. Take it with you. I’ll protect you and Kim Suho from here.”</p>
<p>“…Protect?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah frowned. I nodded my head.</p>
<p>“How do you expect us to believe you?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to if you don’t want to. You will know once you go in.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah stared at the paper suspiciously. Meanwhile, I glanced at Shimurin.</p>
<p>Shimurin smirked and immediately cast a spell. As expected of a grand magician, a flash of light erupted, and we were teleported far away.</p>
<p>“Perfect timing.”</p>
<p>“Perfect timing? I delayed the spell as long as possible because the situation looked fun.”</p>
<p>“You did? Well, it’s fine since we passed them the Messenger.”</p>
<p>As long as I could contact them, I should be able to protect them.</p>
<p>With a grin, I took out the [Mystic Key] and [Athena’s Arrow]. Now, it was time to do my job.</p>
<p>“Let’s see….”</p>
<p>A way to destroy Baal’s castle. I didn’t know whether Jin Sahyuk knew about it, but I did have one way of accomplishing this.</p>
<p>[Would you like to fuse ‘Mystic Key’ with ‘Athena’s Arrow’?]</p>
<p>[Warning. The chance of success is astronomically low.]</p>
<p>By using my Lv.10 Synthesis Skill and Stigma’s magic power, I could fuse the Mystic Key and Athena’s Arrow. The resulting arrow should be capable of dismantling anything in the world.</p>
<p>[Synthesis failed.]</p>
<p>[‘Mystic Key’ and ‘Athena’s Arrow’ have been destroyed.]</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p><em>Tk—</em></p>
<p>With a powerful snapping sound, Athena’s Arrow broke in half, and the Mystic Key turned into dust.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I blinked my eyes repeatedly and looked at the remnants of the items. Like a carp stuck in a frozen pond, I stared blankly at the remains.</p>
<p>“…The hell?”</p>
<p>A panicked mutter escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>“Yo, what happened to my items!?”</p>
<p>The completely unexpected result caught me off guard. A mental breakdown was coming over me. Feeling like I was dreaming, I gathered the remnants of the broken items in a last-ditch effort to make things right.</p>
<p>Then, I used Synthesis again.</p>
<p>[Synthesis failed]</p>
<p>…Not even dust remained.</p>
<p>My legs gave out, and I fell to the ground.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 343. Final Banquet (3)</p>
<p>[Synthesis failed]</p>
<p>‘Don’t calm down. Wait, that’s not right. Calm down.’</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. The Mystic Key and Athena’s Arrow might have been destroyed, but there had to be a better solution.</p>
<p>—…Oi, you okay?</p>
<p>A voice rang in my head. I turned my head in a daze. Shimurin and Jain were staring at me.</p>
<p>—Hajin, what’s wrong~?</p>
<p>I couldn’t hear them well, almost like I was underwater. Suddenly, I felt sleepy. Perhaps everything would return to normal if I went to sleep and woke up.</p>
<p>Wait, no, that was just running away from reality.</p>
<p>“…What’s wrong with him? He’s seems out of it all of a sudden.”</p>
<p>Shimurin’s voice woke me up. I suddenly remembered something. Right, I still had something I could do, even if it was going overboard.</p>
<p>“Time Reversal.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Even though it would hurt a lot, I could just go back in time.</p>
<p>“Huu, huu.”</p>
<p>I took deep breaths. Once, twice, thrice….</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Shimurin and Jain stared at me strangely. I took one final breath and turned to face them. Using Time Reversal just to recover destroyed items…</p>
<p>A sudden philosophical thought popped up in my head. Would Jain in the present be the same person as Jain three minutes in the past?</p>
<p>I shook my head and threw the thought away.</p>
<p>“See you in a bit.”</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and activated Time Reversal. The wind blew backwards and a warping sensation surrounded my body. When I opened my eyes, [Athena’s Moonlight Arrow] and the [Mystic Key] were both in my hands.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>I breathed out a sigh of relief. My legs gave out, and I slumped down on the ground again. Jain and Shimurin gave me strange looks, but that didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Looking at the key and the arrow in my hands, I fell in thought. Should I try fusing them again? Or should I be content that I restored them?</p>
<p>It was then that something strange occurred.</p>
<p>A bright orb of light appeared in the air above the items. The sun-like orb began to bloom like a budding flower. I stared at it with widened eyes.</p>
<p>As the orb gave off a dazzling, golden light, a system window popped up.</p>
<p>[The ‘accumulation of luck’ stacked eight times activates – Miraculous Retry]</p>

<p>**</p>
<p>[Colosseum]</p>
<p>“…What happened to the thing I talked about?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the Colosseum’s waiting room, Jin Seyeon asked Cheok Jungyeong who was lounging around on the couch.</p>
<p>“Do I really have to bring it?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon had asked Cheok Jungyeong to bring the furniture from the Chameleon Troupe’s hideout, knowing how much Vassago was interested in them.</p>
<p>“Yes, I told you, they will come in handy during our negotiation.”</p>
<p>“What, after we beat him up, we’ll console him by giving him some furniture and tell him to go home?”</p>
<p>“…Regardless of what the plan is, having more options isn’t bad.”</p>
<p>Vassago’s Colosseum had a simple format. The challengers would put their lives on the line to fight, just like gladiators. There were ten levels to the Colosseum, and challengers had to clear all levels before they could challenge Vassago. His logic was that he would only accept challenges from the strong.</p>
<p>“But it’s not like we can leave this place, right?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon furrowed her brows at Cheok Jungyeong’s question.</p>
<p>“Don’t you guys have Khalifa? Tell him to come here.”</p>
<p>Challengers couldn’t leave the Colosseum once they entered, but Jin Seyeon and Cheok Jungyeong earned the right to invite a guest after crushing their way through to level 8.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong got up from the couch and asked.</p>
<p>“You know Khalifa?”</p>
<p>“…Pardon? Ah, well, the Chameleon Troupe is famous, after all.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong still gave her a suspicious glance. Jin Seyeon let out a few dry coughs and explained.</p>
<p>“I did some background investigation.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon raised her brows unhappily, and Cheok Jungyeong did the same.</p>
<p>“You think I can trust someone who investigated us so easily?”</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon scratched the back of her neck. She trudged to the bed and lied down. Cheok Jungyeong smirked and lied back down on the couch. Just like that, silence filled the room.</p>
<p>The level 8 challenger’s waiting room was large and quiet. After a moment, a soft voice cut through the air.</p>
<p>“You guys killed my father.”</p>
<p>It was Jin Seyeon’s voice.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong murmured while still lying on the couch.</p>
<p>“…It’s pretty common.”</p>
<p>“Killing people?”</p>
<p>“In this world, it’s common to kill and be killed. You should know it too. Think of all the Djinns you killed. Aren’t they human too?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon twisted her body to the side. Her bow was leaning on the head of the bed. It was the same bow that had taken the lives of hundreds of Djinns.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“My father was my only family.”</p>
<p>“That’s common too. There are also people who are born orphans.”</p>
<p>“I sometimes wish I was born an orphan too.”</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong suddenly chuckled. Jin Seyeon furrowed her brows and glared at Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“What’s funny?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, I just remembered something. There was someone who used to make fun of me by calling me ‘Orphan Producer.’”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Puhahaha. I think it’s funny. You don’t have to laugh if you don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong got up from the couch, his large body towering over Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>Looking at her, Cheok Jungyeong smiled.</p>
<p>“If you want to avenge your father, I’ll welcome you at any time. I don’t know if I’m the one who killed him, but the Chameleon Troupe is one being. But just know that you’ll have to put your life on the line as well.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong spoke calmly. He had no fear of death, having spent most of his life with one foot in the River Styx. Jin Seyeon’s face quickly turned vicious.</p>
<p>“…No thanks. You weren’t part of the Chameleon Troupe when that incident happened.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you were busy running around the steppes of Manchu killing people.”</p>
<p>“Kuhum, you even know about that? …Oi, don’t look at me like I’m some sort of a monster. I’m not the man I used to be.”</p>
<p>“Oh please, there are even rumors that you eat human flesh.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon pulled the bedsheet over her head. Cheok Jungyeong replied, almost like he was giving an excuse.</p>
<p>“Human flesh? I don’t eat things that aren’t tasty. Plus, it’s true that I changed. That guy changed me before I even noticed.”</p>
<p>“…That guy? You mean Black Lotus?”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>When she heard Black Lotus’s name, Jin Seyeon peeked her head out of the bedsheet. She was attracted to Black Lotus for reasons she didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Was it admiration, fear, respect, or rivalry? She didn’t know how to describe her feelings for him. But her intuition as the Divine Archer told her that there was something about Black Lotus that resembled herself.</p>
<p>“Feel free to tell me more.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon spoke gently. Cheok Jungyeong raised his head. Jin Seyeon was looking at him in anticipation. However, Cheok Jungyeong only gave off a cold smirk before lying back down.</p>
<p>“Nah.”</p>
<p>“…Just a bit.”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll talk to Khalifa about that furniture though, not that I think it will help.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon scratched her cheek. She was still happy about the information she pried out, so she gave it a rest for the day and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Good night.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Baal’s Castle – Banquet Hall]</p>
<p>An orchestral classical piece was still flowing in the air as Jin Sahyuk stared at Yi Yeonjun. Yi Yeonjun continued as he looked deeper into Jin Sahyuk’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Do you get what kind of an existence you are now? You’re nothing but a puppet.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t say anything. She simply thought Yi Yeonjun had gone crazy. But she also didn’t think he was completely insane.</p>
<p>At that moment, Shin Jonghak spoke up.</p>
<p>“That fool must be misunderstanding something, right?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>When Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows, Shin Jonghak smirked and continued.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s his delusion or a side-effect of his Gift, but he must believe that this world is a novel. He’s living while believing that it is.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak was saying that Kim Hajin was a megalomaniac who deluded himself into thinking that this world was a novel he wrote.</p>
<p>However, Jin Sahyuk knew Baal was more than capable of discerning reality from fantasy. As far as she was concerned, it was more probable that Yi Yeonjun had gone crazy rather than doubting Baal.</p>
<p>“…Shush.”</p>
<p>Regardless, what she had to do was simple.</p>
<p>“Where’s Baal?”</p>
<p>To find Baal. She would know the truth once she talked to him.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun readily replied.</p>
<p>“Baal’s upstairs.”</p>
<p>“So what do we need to do to go up?”</p>
<p>“You need more people.”</p>
<p>As he said that, Yi Yeonjun pointed at the banquet hall’s door. Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak both turned their gazes downwards.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em> And at that moment, the door creaked open. Jin Sahyuk frowned, and Shin Jonghak’s face wriggled with joy.</p>
<p>—Huh? Where’s this?</p>
<p>On the first floor of the banquet hall, Chae Nayun was looking around with a greatsword in her hand.</p>
<p>—I’m not sure… some sort of party?</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah’s gaze scanned the hall.</p>
<p>—I see Suho-ssi over there.</p>
<p>Rachel pointed at a couple dancing in the middle of the hall. Kim Suho and Aileen also spotted them. Kim Suho couldn’t hear Yi Yeonjun because he was focused on dancing. Once the others arrived, Kim Suho greeted them with a smile.</p>
<p>—Hey, Suho… it’s been a while.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah stared at Kim Suho from a little distance away. She was happy to see him but didn’t show it on her face.</p>
<p>—Ah, yes, it really has been a while.</p>
<p>Kim Suho stood straight and bowed slightly. Yun Seung-Ah smiled bitterly and told Kim Suho and Aileen about who they met.</p>
<p>—We met Black Lotus.</p>
<p>—Really?</p>
<p>—Yeah. He said he’s helping you. Is that true?</p>
<p>—Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned back to Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun opened his mouth, like he was waiting for this moment.</p>
<p>“Now that there are eleven of you here, you should be able to go up. Go ahead. Find Baal and hear the truth. Then, you can fall into despair.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak hopped down to the first floor to see Chae Nayun, leaving only Jin Sahyuk glaring at Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>But not long afterwards, Jin Sahyuk made her usual proud smile.</p>
<p>“Yi Yeonjun… it looks like you’re mistaken.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk gathered magic power in her hands. Her black magic power coalesced like a storm and emanated its overwhelming presence. Her Authority blazed up as it devoured reality.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what the truth is. Even if what you’re saying is true, it doesn’t matter to me that this world is a novel.”</p>
<p><em>Guoooo…</em> She reached out with her burning right hand and grabbed Yi Yeonjun’s head. Looking at Yi Yeonjun’s empty eyes, she shouted loudly.</p>
<p>“I am not a puppet, but a king! And the one who decides that isn’t you or this world! It’s me! I am the one who decides who I am! As long as I’m alive, I am a king, and that’s all I need to know to live in this world!”</p>
<p>She could feel several presences from her spot on the balcony. Chae Nayun and Shin Jonghak, Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah, Aileen and Kim Youngjin… there were even more climbing up the staircase.</p>
<p>She could even feel Kim Hajin, watching over her from outside.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk made a faint smile.</p>
<p>“I am different from you entirely!”</p>
<p><em>KOOONG—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, an explosion erupted in the middle of the banquet hall. Yi Yeonjun scattered into dust, and Jin Sahyuk looked down from the balcony with widened eyes.</p>
<p>—W-What happened!? Who are these people?</p>
<p>The men and women, who had been dancing in the hall, had all turned into Death Knights.</p>
<p>“What….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk froze. She looked down at the first floor in a daze.</p>
<p>—Take out your weapons, everyone! Aileen Unni!</p>
<p>—Yeah, I know. I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Death Knights were surrounding the group. But what shocked Jin Sahyuk wasn’t the sheer number of Death Knights or the sudden disappearance of Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>The Death Knights weren’t wearing helmets, so Jin Sahyuk recognized them. Even if they were wearing them, she wouldn’t have missed the insignia on their armor and shield.</p>
<p>A crown of ice and a wolf.</p>
<p>That was the symbol of Jin Sahyuk’s kingdom, Plerion.</p>
<p>They were the knights of Plerion, who had protected her until the moment she died.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 344. Meeting (1)</p>
<p>[Baal’s Castle – Banquet Hall]</p>
<p>The Death Knights revived by the devil had no emotions in their eyes. However, their hands grasped their swords tightly. Having lost their consciousness and will, the bodies left with only their instincts stared at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>They were the knights of Plerion, the servants of Jin Sahyuk who dreamed of a brighter future. Jin Sahyuk clenched her teeth. She was more confused than angry.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Chae Nayun swung her sword with a spirited shout. Her greatsword of magic power shattered the banquet hall’s ceiling.</p>
<p>“Sunshine, Earth, Watery…”</p>
<p>Rachel called her elementals. The elementals of wind, ground, and water floated up and revealed themselves. Earth focused on defense, creating barriers to protect its allies; Watery transformed into a cold mist and froze some of the Death Knights.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>Gusts of white sword wind blew in the battlefield, almost like falling cherry blossoms. This was the work of Yun Seung-Ah’s Flower Sword. With elegant movements, Yun Seung-Ah displayed her swordsmanship.</p>
<p>Slowed by Rachel’s elementals, the Death Knights couldn’t follow Yun Seung-Ah’s attacks. One by one, the Knights’ heads fell to the floor.</p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn’t enough to stop the knights who were already dead. In fact, the ones that had their heads chopped off charged at Yun Seung-Ah more viciously. Although her Flower Sword severed their arms and legs, one Death Knight eventually reached Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>Just as its sword was about to stab her, a fierce wind blew around her.</p>
<p>“…A storm will devour you!”</p>
<p>A storm of Spirit Speech pushed the Death Knights up to the sky. Immediately afterward, a flash of golden light from the Sword Saint cut through them.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>A shower of golden light poured down from the sky. Kim Suho’s sword light eliminated dozens of Death Knights instantly. He looked back at Yun Seung-Ah and muttered.</p>
<p>“…Let’s continue.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah made a faint smile at his encouragement. She woke up from her stupor and returned to battle.</p>
<p><em>Kwang-! Clang-! Koong-!</em></p>
<p>The battle continued, destroying the banquet hall. The fancy interior turned into a muddy mess as hundreds of Death Knights ceaselessly fought back.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk watched her knights from the balcony. She watched them get beheaded, their hands chopped off, and their swords destroyed.</p>
<p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk cursed out loud. She knew they weren’t the real knights of Plerion. Baal had to be playing a trick on her after reading Bell’s memories.</p>
<p>She tried to calm herself to overcome this unwelcome taste.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk let out a short cry. A small child she saw in the distance broke her heart.</p>
<p>“What….”</p>
<p>In the corner of the dark battlefield, a child from Plerion was hiding by the curtain. Jin Sahyuk remembered the pitiful boy. He was someone she incarcerated and left to die. The boy who died in the prison cell was now staring at her.</p>
<p>Puharen. The boy who turned into a devil.</p>
<p>Her chest pounded. Unable to meet his eyes, Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes. Something welled up from the bottom of her heart. The boy’s face surfaced beneath her eyelids. Jin Sahyuk fell to her knees.</p>
<p>The seal of magic power buried deep inside her became broken. A faint voice rose up like the falling sand in an hourglass.</p>
<p><em>Why am I stuck here? It’s cold. I’m hungry. How long do I have to wait? The chains are cold. The pain isn’t going away. I want to leave. Let me out… let me out….</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk covered her ears, but she could still hear the voice. She clutched her chest in pain, but the pain didn’t go away.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk breathed heavily and remembered Akatrina.</p>
<p>The world full of sadness, loneliness, and regret…. Her kingdom…. The boy she killed to become the king, who returned to destroy her kingdom as a devil.</p>
<p>She couldn’t forget Puharen. She felt nauseous, and her head hurt. Almost as if her limbs were rotting away, her past ate away at her…</p>
<p>—…Jin Sahyuk! Jin Sahyuk! Snap out of it!</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice woke her up. Jin Sahyuk snapped her eyes open in surprise.</p>
<p>“W-What?”</p>
<p>—Finally, you can hear me.</p>
<p>A sighing voice rang out. Jin Sahyuk quickly noticed that it was Kim Hajin’s voice.</p>
<p>—What are you doing there, squatting? Are you okay?</p>
<p>“…What? Y-You can see me? Where are you?”</p>
<p>—I’m outside the castle, but I can see what’s happening inside with my awakened eyes. Reinforcements are coming soon, by the way.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>Just as he said that the banquet hall’s door burst open.</p>
<p>“Knight Commander! We are here!”</p>
<p>Reinforcements had arrived, just like Kim Hajin said. Dozens of knights led by Airun, the Devil Hunter Harin, Heroes from Earth like Yohei and Yi Jiyoon, and Yi Yongha and Nicholas from the Temple of Justice….</p>
<p>They were the allies who entered Baal’s barrier through the gap Kim Hajin opened.</p>
<p>“…Looks like the party’s already started.”</p>
<p>Nicholas, the rank 4 member of the Temple of Justice, raised her dagger. With a seductive smile, she licked her dagger. Next, Yi Yongha appeared with his staff raised.</p>
<p>“We’re here, chairman. Not too late, right?”</p>
<p>Looking at Yi Yongha, Aileen smirked.</p>
<p>“No, you’re su~per late. Also, what’s up with that staff?”</p>
<p>“It’s a gift from Yeonha-ssi. It adds the exorcism attribute to my fire.”</p>
<p>Yi Yongha imbued his magic power into the staff. An inextinguishable hellfire shot up to the sky, but Jin Sahyuk didn’t pay any attention to it.</p>
<p>“How long were you watching?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>—For about three minutes, I guess?</p>
<p>“Did you… hear anything?”</p>
<p>—Hear what?</p>
<p>It seemed Kim Hajin didn’t know the conversation she had with Yi Yeonjun. She paused for a moment to think. Yi Yeonjun said that this world was a novel Kim Hajin created, but she didn’t have the time to confirm whether that was true.</p>
<p>At that moment, Kim Hajin spoke up once more.</p>
<p>—Anyways, I think I can do it.</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk infused magic power into her heart as she replied. It was a bit of a unique process to overcome her trauma.</p>
<p>—Destroy the castle.</p>
<p>“…Really?”</p>
<p>—Yeah. But I’m going to do it right now.</p>
<p>“Now?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>—Yep. So, King, I’ll trust you to take care of Baal.</p>
<p>“…Tsk, do whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk got up without saying much. Kim Hajin’s snarky command got on her nerves, but she liked being called a king.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>She stood tall and looked to the distance. Puharen was still there. But this time, she didn’t avert her gaze.</p>
<p>“…Hahaha.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk suddenly let out a chuckle. She realized she didn’t feel anything when she looked at Puharen.</p>
<p>She knew that the true worth of her Authority, [Reality Manipulation], was in manipulating the ‘inside’ rather than the outside.</p>
<p>“I bet you didn’t know this, you piece of shit.”</p>
<p>Using this Authority, Jin Sahyuk eliminated the complicated and dark feelings she had towards Puharen. Now, she could even smile while looking at him.</p>
<p>“Just you wait, Baal, I’ll go find you soon.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk looked up at the ceiling and crossed her arms arrogantly. Behind her, a terrifying amount of magic power rose up. Her reddish-black magic power turned into dozens of spears.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Outside Baal’s Castle – A Forest Shrouded by a Barrier]</p>
<p>“Yep. So, King, I’ll trust you to take care of Baal.”</p>
<p>I sent Jin Sahyuk a Mental Transmission as I held the Black Lotus Bow and Mystic Key in my hands. As I had activated my Ultimate Skill, [Complete Understanding of Spirit Power], my Mental Transmission was crystal clear.</p>
<p>—…Tsk, do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s reply was rather simple. With a grin, I checked my luck stat once more.</p>
<p>[Invariable Stat – Luck 9.9]</p>
<p>A luck stat transcending human capability. I wasn’t sure what I would gain from this 30-minute period. But I did know that I couldn’t waste this opportunity.</p>
<p>I immediately used Synthesis.</p>
<p>[Fusing Athena’s Moonlight Arrow with Mystic Key…]</p>
<p>[The chance of success is astronomically low….]</p>
<p>[But you succeed! A perfect fusion increases the rank of the item!]</p>
<p>The key fused with the arrow and became ‘Athena’s Mystic Arrow’.</p>
<p>“Are you ready~? You’re gonna shoot now~?”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>I nodded my head at Jain’s question. Then, I nocked the arrow onto the bow.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>The bowstring tensed up. I aimed the bow at the Devil’s Castle and targeted only the castle. Using Overclocking, I squeezed out every ounce of Stigma’s magic power.</p>
<p>“Argh-“</p>
<p>It felt like my heart was going to burst from the Time Reversal I was forced to use, but it was bearable. I needed to endure it at the very least.</p>
<p>[You used Overclocking… Your lifeforce has been damaged!]</p>
<p>[Luck activates!]</p>
<p>[You used Overclocking… Your lifeforce has been damaged!]</p>
<p>[Luck activates!]</p>
<p>Magic power gathered by repeating the above process and began to shake the heaven and earth as it brewed up a storm.</p>
<p><em>Whish—!</em></p>
<p>The air currents surrounding me flowed into the arrow, and leaves and grass flew into the air.</p>
<p><em>Tssssst…</em></p>
<p>Burned by the magic power, the soil and rock underneath me turned black.</p>
<p>“I’m shooting now. Get ready.”</p>
<p>Before I fired, I signaled Jin Sahyuk. It was then.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone approached me from behind. That person broke through Jain and Shimurin and reached out towards me, pulling my arrow and twisting its course.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaang—!</em></p>
<p>At the same time, large and narrow blades shot up from the spot I was standing.</p>
<p>The misfired arrow then shot up towards the sky, past my intended mark.</p>
<p>“What….”</p>
<p>I stared at the Devil’s Castle as I was dragged back by the mysterious hand.</p>
<p>Even I couldn’t see the peak point of the castle. A mysterious barrier was blocking my vision.</p>
<p>But I decided not to worry about it too much. In fact, I wondered what devastating effect my 9.9 luck stat would have.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Devil’s Castle – Baal’s Room]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yi Yeonjun returned to Baal’s room. He was still raging. Although Yi Yeonjun couldn’t see Baal, he could tell by the demonic energy covering the room.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun empathized with Baal. Baal called himself a ‘World Collector’, yet he had just found out that he himself was nothing more than a small piece of a collection.</p>
<p>“…Baal.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun called Baal’s name. At that moment,<em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>The space pulsed intensely. It was a pulsation of anger.</p>
<p><em>Sssss….</em></p>
<p>Soon, demonic energy gathered and formed the shape of a giant face. This was the personification of Baal, a transcendental being.</p>
<p>Baal moved his lips made of magic power.</p>
<p>—Who permitted you to speak my name.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun stared at Baal who was expressing his anger. Baal narrowed his eyes and glared at Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“What’s your plan now?”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun’s brusque tone caused Baal to narrow his eyes even further. His face twitched a bit, as though he was deep in thought. Then, he spat out in a nonhuman voice.</p>
<p>—…Let me ask you first, human.</p>
<p>The room rumbled. Baal’s fury permeated the room.</p>
<p>—How do you plan to live from now?</p>
<p>“It depends on the truth of the memory you passed me.”</p>
<p>—That was the truth. There wasn’t a single bit of falsehood in the memory Bell gave me. That was… Truth.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>—Don’t get too cocky, human. I am an existence that has transcended worlds. I could tell that that was the truth.</p>
<p>“Then….”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t have confidence.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun couldn’t find a way to overcome the helplessness and sense of emptiness he felt. Because he found value in things that weren’t himself, knowing that this world was a novel was a huge blow to him. He couldn’t ignore it as easily as Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>—In the end, you are just human. But I am different.</p>
<p>But Baal was different.</p>
<p>A human’s anger was different from Baal’s anger. As a mere human, Yi Yeonjun lost his drive. However, Baal was plenty powerful.</p>
<p>—I will become the destroyer.</p>
<p>Baal’s demonic energy surged up. His presence enveloped the entire castle.</p>
<p>The Demon Realm Gate, the Devil’s Castle, and the container known as Bell.</p>
<p>The conditions for Descent had all been met.</p>
<p>—I will destroy that irresponsible, reckless man and put an end to the world he created.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em> An overwhelming reverberation of magic power shook the room. Yi Yeonjun closed his eyes as Baal released demonic energy in fury.</p>
<p>Baal’s demonic energy stormed the room as if to destroy the world.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Chweeeek—!</em></p>
<p>A small arrow broke through the barrier. Baal and Yi Yeonjun turned to the bed, which had just been struck by the arrow.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>A moment of silence filled the room.</p>
<p>In this short period of time, Yi Yeonjun pondered, ‘How did this arrow get here?’</p>
<p>But before he could even think, the arrow released a brilliant light.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaaa….</em></p>
<p>A hot, holy current of silver light swallowed everything in the room.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 345. Meeting (2)</p>
<p>Early morning, when the full moon was still shining brightly in the sky, a baby wrapped in a quilt was placed on the steps of a temple. Faint light lit the baby’s face. He wasn’t crying and only stared at his mother’s face.</p>
<p>Soon, the mother began to cry. She turned back as her baby watched her and walked away reluctantly.</p>
<p>A smile emerged on the innocent baby’s face. Hearing the baby’s laughter, the mother began to run. Tears scattered in the air as she ran and ran.</p>
<p>Soon, the moon grew faint, and the temple’s door opened when the sun began to rise. An old nun stopped in front of the baby. With a sigh, she picked him up.</p>
<p>The baby opened his eyes, in which reflected the nun’s wrinkly face. With a gentle smile, the nun stroked the baby’s quilt and congratulated his birth.</p>
<p>The baby was thus placed in the temple’s care and was given the name ‘Eren’.</p>
<p>Eren spent much of his childhood in the temple. The temple was his home, his place of worship, his playground, and school. The temple’s nuns taught him many things.</p>
<p>Eren was never a big fan of studying. He favored cutting wood instead. Rather than history, he wanted to learn swordsmanship and knighthood.</p>
<p>But because the temple was located in the rural countryside far away from the capital, the nuns couldn’t provide him with the education he wanted no matter how hard they tried.</p>
<p>Then one day, a retired knight visited the temple. The nuns introduced Eren to the knight. The knight wanted a successor but had no child. Eren was the perfect match.</p>
<p>With a mutual understanding, Eren became the knight’s student.</p>
<p>Eren felt happy every time he swung his sword. In those moments, he wasn’t sad that he didn’t have parents or friends.</p>
<p>Eren trained with his sword and even slept with it. The dream of becoming a knight sprouted within him. The hero of justice he read about in fairy tales… he trained every day as he imagined himself becoming such a person.</p>
<p>The nuns watched him grow with pride. They treated him as if he were their son.</p>
<p>But they weren’t left with much time because the ‘Demon Realm Transformation’, which had been slowly devouring Akatrina, had finally reached the temple.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Outside Baal’s Castle]</p>
<p>The misfired arrow flew up to the top of Baal’s castle before flying into a bed and causing a silver explosion.</p>
<p>The power of [Dismantling] imbued in the arrow shook the entire castle. The rumbling turned into a terrifying storm of energy that destroyed the top parts of the castle. The demonic energy surrounding the castle scattered, and its foundation broke down. The destruction wasn’t limited to the top of the castle.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>With an explosive sound, the sound of a collapsing building rang out. The shell of Baal’s Devil’s Castle broke down completely.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t have the time to watch this sight. A blade shot towards me from behind.</p>
<p><em>Clang—!</em></p>
<p>A black barrier instantly formed and blocked the attack. The barrier was neither Jain’s nor Shimurin’s. I let out a sigh of relief and turned to the side.</p>
<p>I could see a familiar face. A smile emerged on my face when I saw her.</p>
<p>“Did you rest well, Boss?”</p>
<p>Boss had appeared out of nowhere and protected me.</p>
<p>“You should be careful when you’re using your bow.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Boss~ Are you okay now~?”</p>
<p>Jain cut in. Boss nodded her head nonchalantly, and Shimurin shrugged as she looked at Boss like she was her disciple.</p>
<p>“Rather than that….”</p>
<p>Boss’s shadow stretched out, flying at the speed of light. It grabbed the person responsible for attacking me and dragged him by his feet.</p>
<p>“Kuuk…”</p>
<p>The attacker was a Djinn. The shadow coiled up his body and strangled his neck. Looking at his face, I frowned. I remembered seeing him before.</p>
<p>But since I couldn’t remember, I used [Observation and Reading] to look at his setting.</p>
<p>“…Ah, you’re Terror’s lackey.”</p>
<p>I finally remembered him. I had seen his face before on a wanted poster in Violet Banquet. He was a subordinate of Terror, who was one of the Nine Evils.</p>
<p>"I almost forgot. I guess the Nine Evils are still alive and well."</p>
<p>I turned to Boss, who promptly nodded her head. Other than Destruction, who was killed by Aileen, the rest of the Nine Evils were still unharmed.</p>
<p>"…Terror is a supporter of Astaroth. Let's interrogate this man and find out where Terror is hiding."</p>
<p>Boss took her shadow back and grabbed the Djinn's neck with her hand. She seemed quite angry.</p>
<p>"Oi, I don't think you should be paying attention to that guy right now."</p>
<p>Shimurin muttered as she watched Baal's crumbling castle.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Look."</p>
<p>Shimurin pointed at the castle with a grin. Above it, Baal made his appearance. He looked just like Bell, his incarnation body.</p>
<p>He was glaring at me…</p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>He roared.</p>
<p>His scream shook everything inside his barrier. Soon, Baal's body rose to the sky. At the same time, a terrifying amount of demonic energy flowed out.</p>
<p>Baal unleashed his demonic energy in all directions. It seeped into his barrier, turning it even darker.</p>
<p>I had no idea what he was planning to do.</p>
<p>"Oi."</p>
<p>But Shimurin seemed to know something as she nudged my shoulder with a grin. I looked back at her blankly.</p>
<p>"Wait for me. I'll see you again soon."</p>
<p>As she said that, she covered us in a barrier.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, the world exploded.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Virtual Reality Game - 'Leraje's Game']</p>
<p>Around the same time, Leraje's character, Lijengy, shook. She looked up at the game's sky, feeling an explosion of demonic energy somewhere far away.</p>
<p>"Lord!"</p>
<p>Her loyal servant, Corte, otherwise known by his ID, 'Leraje's Monster', shouted. Leraje nodded her head. She spoke through the chat system.</p>
<p>—Looks like Old Man finally descended.</p>
<p>Leraje let out a light sigh and looked around her surroundings. A vast wilderness dyed in darkness was spread out before her. This place was called Lekior Field and was a famous high-level training ground in the game.</p>
<p>Because it had a high spawn rate of powerful monsters, most players couldn't enter it at all. However, Leraje and her servants had easily occupied the place with Leraje's special control.</p>
<p>—Take all the items.</p>
<p>Leraje ordered her guild members.</p>
<p>—Blacksmith, can you make something with this?</p>
<p>"With enough of them, I should be able to make a [High-rank Obsidian Breastplate]."</p>
<p>A week had passed since the game's release. The game was more realistic than one might expect. To craft high-rank equipment, a large quantity of crafting materials were needed. But no matter how good one's equipment was, a moment of carelessness could lead to their death.</p>
<p>Plus, there was no revival mechanic. Death in the game was permanent.</p>
<p>Leraje enjoyed this realism, and it was the same for other players. If the game wasn't fun, it never would have reached 15 million concurrent players.</p>
<p>The game company Leol had really created an RPG game of the century.</p>
<p>"Will you go meet His Highness, Baal?"</p>
<p>Corte asked as he collected the items. His expression was serious, but the way he was hunched over to pick up the items was funny.</p>
<p>—I should… but since I made a promise with this world, I will keep it. My war will only be within this game.</p>
<p>"…We will follow our Lord's wishes."</p>
<p>Corte bowed. Leraje nodded without a word.</p>
<p>—I'll log out first.</p>
<p>"Yes, Lord!"</p>
<p>Leraje logged out. Meanwhile, Corte remained in the game. He wanted to follow Leraje, but he had been ordered to take care of in-game duties.</p>
<p>15 million human players were gunning for Leraje's guild. It was 15,000,000 vs 1,000, so to say. Corte refused to let his guard down even for a moment.</p>
<p>"Blood Brothers!"</p>
<p>Corte turned back to his fellow demons and shouted with a serious face.</p>
<p>"Collect the items! We will move to the next dungeon soon!"</p>
<p>Corte and the guild members quickly gathered up the necessary items.</p>
<p>—We're ready, sir!</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>
<p>Corte laughed and pointed at the 'boss dungeon cave' in the distance.</p>
<p>"Let's get moving. Get ready for a boss raid!"</p>
<p>Boss raids were one of the most fun parts of this game. Corte was somewhat disappointed that his lord would miss the upcoming raid.</p>
<p>—Yes, sir!</p>
<p>Corte began to march towards the cave. The members of Leraje's guild were filled with excitement and anticipation for the battle. Although they were playing the game for Leraje's sake, they truly enjoyed it as well.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>[Earth - Korea]</p>
<p>…Hajin… Kim Hajin!</p>
<p>I slowly opened my eyes. I felt terrible aches all over my body, but I could tell that someone was shaking my body.</p>
<p>…Wake up!</p>
<p>It was from Kim Suho. He was slapping my cheeks and saying something. I looked at his lips.</p>
<p>—Wake up, Kim Hajin! Wake up!</p>
<p>Kim Suho was shaking me and slapping me with a face full of worry. However, I couldn't move my body at all. It was as if I had been drained of all energy.</p>
<p>—Hajin, Hajin! Snap out of it!</p>
<p>After an unknown amount of time, my consciousness returned and my other senses including hearing recovered.</p>
<p>"Kim Hajin! Are you okay!?"</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>I swallowed the saliva pooling up in my mouth. I looked at the sky and the world around me.</p>
<p>I was familiar with the surrounding scenery. I could see Essential Armory's protective barrier in the distance and even North Hamgyeong Province's city.</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly Korea.</p>
<p>I looked out at the horizon in a daze.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked again. I turned back to him and nodded. He then helped me up with his hand.</p>
<p>"We're… back on Earth?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>I first checked to see if Aether worked. After protecting me from the explosion, it had transformed into a small bag and was storing Black Lotus's equipment.</p>
<p>I took out my Desert Eagle and looked up at the clear, blue sky.</p>
<p>"What…."</p>
<p>I furrowed my brows in confusion. Did Jin Sahyuk and Kim Suho kill Baal in that short instance?</p>
<p>I faced Kim Suho once again.</p>
<p>"What happened to Baal?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. The castle suddenly exploded and this happened."</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>It was only after this that I realized who was around me. Chae Nayun, Shin Jonghak, Yun Seung-Ah, Jin Sahyuk, Yi Yeonghan, Kim Youngjin, and even Jain and Boss… They were all sprawled out on the ground.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>I got up to run to Boss. But I didn't need to. Jin Yohan, Kaita, and Khalifa appeared and took Jain and Boss away.</p>
<p>Soon, other high-ranking Heroes came over.</p>
<p>—Ho~ Looks like everyone's back.</p>
<p>Yoo Sihyuk appeared with nine white wolves.</p>
<p>—Yeonha, Yeonha!</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong ran around to look for his daughter.</p>
<p>—Look for anyone who's injured! It doesn't matter what guild they're from! We have to save everyone!</p>
<p>Vice-Leader Yi Jin-Ah arrived with Essence of the Strait's Heroes. Also arriving with them were Seo Youngji, Oh Junhyuk, the fully armored Heynckes, and the apathetic Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>Surrounded by hundreds of Heroes, I breathed out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"…Haa."</p>
<p>I felt like I could finally rest. Just as I loosened my nerves a bit…</p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>A loud screech rang out in the sky. The clear sky turned reddish-black, and Baal once again appeared in the air.</p>
<p>The Heroes in the area quickly prepared themselves for battle.</p>
<p>Sssk—</p>
<p>Kim Suho also took out Misteltein.</p>
<p>I chuckled, thinking it would have been too easy if Baal was really dead.</p>
<p>—Grohack Derla Croska Fedra!</p>
<p>Baal muttered incomprehensible words. The devil's cry tore through the sky and formed a pentagram.</p>
<p><em>Koooong…!</em></p>
<p>Demonic energy stormed through the air, and the earth rumbled crazily. Kim Suho and I watched the scene in a daze.</p>
<p>Baal seemed to be casting a ritual-like grand magic.</p>
<p>—Come!</p>
<p>In that instant, the pentagram flipped upside down, and the summoning of an evil god began.</p>
<p>First, a giant leg appeared. The leg was bigger than anything I had ever seen before, and it stepped onto Korea's land.</p>
<p><em>Boom—!</em></p>
<p>The earth shook from the single step. A huge shockwave spread out and razed the nearby trees.</p>
<p>—Uaaak!</p>
<p>—Kuak!</p>
<p>Several medics fainted after being hit by the collapsing trees. Heroes who were crushed by the foot died on the spot.</p>
<p>Kim Suho's face froze as he watched the scene of devastation.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I looked at Kim Suho's hands. They were trembling. Kim Suho was afraid. It must be because he recognized the owner of the leg.</p>
<p>Rank 21 Devil, Morax.</p>
<p>He was the calamity that ruined Akatrina.</p>
<p>Morax was larger and more destructive than the one we saw in the 'Recorded Past'.</p>
<p>"Suho."</p>
<p>I grabbed Kim Suho's trembling hand. He flinched in surprise and looked back at me.</p>
<p>I stared into his eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>"Don't worry."</p>
<p>Kim Suho swallowed his saliva. I grabbed his hand more tightly and announced with confidence.</p>
<p>"I can kill someone like him with a single bullet."</p>
<p>I wasn't lying, technically speaking. After all, I had done exactly that in the world of the Recorded Past.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked at me in silence. He seemed to be searching for the source of my confidence.</p>
<p>After about a minute, Kim Suho smirked and muttered.</p>
<p>"…It won't be that easy."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 346. Meeting (3)</p>
<p>The child grew quickly, and the master realized that he alone was not enough to bring out the best in the child. The child needed an even greater role model. In order to blossom as a knight, he had to go to the capital.</p>
<p>His family at the temple understood and supported him. The nuns gave him all they had, three gold coins to use for travel expenses, and the child left for the capital with the knight.</p>
<p>Their journey was not as smooth as they had hoped. They ran into thugs, encountered monsters, and got trapped in natural barriers.</p>
<p>Together, the master and the pupil overcame many obstacles and finally arrived at the capital city.</p>
<p>The capital of Plerion was still magnificent even as the world’s lifespan neared its end. Tall buildings and the bustling streets mesmerized the child.</p>
<p>His master, who used to serve the kingdom as a knight, brought the child to the Royal Palace by connections. There the child met a boy who would later become his lord.</p>
<p>The name of his future lord was ‘Puharen’, a fragile boy trembling with fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Earth — Korea]</p>
<p>Morax descended from the pentagram. The advent of this gigantic devil was particularly destructive. His right leg came down first and crushed the grasslands near the border. His left leg destroyed the barriers the Heroes had made.</p>
<p>Just like that, the giant devil set foot on Earth.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin stared at the devil in silence. Though all Morax had done so far was appear on Earth, his instincts warned him that the current situation was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>The most he could see from the ground was the devil’s knee. Morax’s upper body was hidden from view behind the clouds and the fog.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin decided to increase the distance between them first. Because a sharpshooter had to be far away from his target to be able to aim properly, he needed to be as far away from the battlefield as possible.</p>
<p>“Stay here. I’ll cover you from behind.”</p>
<p>He disappeared, leaving Kim Suho behind. Aileen appeared almost immediately. She had a huge bump on her head from when she fell out of the Demon Realm Gate.</p>
<p>“Hey Kim Suho, what’s that?”</p>
<p>Aileen asked, rubbing her head. Kim Suho tightened his grip around Misteltein.</p>
<p>“It’s Morax.”</p>
<p>“Morax?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Morax— the same calamity that destroyed Akatrina in the past.</p>
<p>Kim Suho still remembered the devil, how devastatingly strong it was, and even Puharen’s tears.</p>
<p>“…Well, whatever.”</p>
<p>Aileen increased her magic power. She squinted her eyes and glowered at Morax while stretching.</p>
<p>“Nothing will matter once I kill him.”</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>—We have urgent news! Devils are being witnessed all around the globe!</p>
<p>—Help! Help! We need assistance!</p>
<p>—Requesting backup!</p>
<p>Desperate voices broke out of the Heroes’ smartwatches.</p>
<p>“W-What’s going on? Why all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Aileen was obviously perplexed. Kim Suho calmly leaned over and looked into the smartwatch of the Hero next to him.</p>
<p>—This is Japan! A huge pentagram suddenly appeared on the ground and countless Djinns began pouring out of it….</p>
<p>—Russia here! D-Devils have appeared here as well!</p>
<p>These voices deprived Kim Suho of his sense of reality. He grew dizzy, his vision clouded and his body staggered. The nightmare of the previous world, which he had worked so hard to forget, seemed to come to life again. This made him sick.</p>
<p>“What's the status quo?”</p>
<p>At that moment, however, a particularly clear voice flowed into his ear. Kim Suho raised his head. Yoo Yeonha was there. She was looking into the current situation with Yoo Jinwoong's smartwatch.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Her expression stiffened. She looked around again and sighed.</p>
<p>“Father, I’ll get moving now.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you stay in a safe place. Go on, hurry. Hey, Kim Hwagok!”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong quickly ordered a Hero from Essence of the Strait to accompany Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“My name is Kim Hwagok, a high-intermediate-rank Hero. Please hold my hand, Chief Officer. I have the Teleport Skill.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha threw a glance at Kim Suho and held Kim Hwagok’s hand.</p>
<p><em>Shoong—</em> Soon, Kim Hwagok activated [Teleport] and she was evacuated to a safe place.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before Kim Hwagok returned to the battlefield again. He held several smartwatches in his hand.</p>
<p>He handed one of them to Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Chief Officer ordered me to give this to you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. Thank you.”</p>
<p>The smartwatch was immediately connected to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>—Can you hear me?</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded. He shrugged as he looked into the smartwatch.</p>
<p>“By the way, did you learn a new skill? Your voice is… soothing.”</p>
<p>There was something special about Yoo Yeonha’s voice. The comforting voice seemed to find its way to him naturally even at a time like this. It was thanks to her voice that he had managed to remain sane.</p>
<p>—Yeah, sort of. But I won’t tell you what it is. Focus on the current situation for now.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kim Suho grabbed his sword in silence.</p>
<p>At that moment, a woman approached him. Her scent was familiar.</p>
<p>It was Chae Nayun, as he had expected.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun looked up at Morax with Balmung in her hand.</p>
<p>“…He’s freaking huge. How is this size even possible?”</p>
<p>She muttered, and Kim Suho gave a small smile.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun turned to Kim Suho and comforted him.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry too much, though. What’s wrong? You don’t seem yourself.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kim Suho remained silent and scratched the back of his neck. He felt a little ashamed of the fact that his fear was so apparent.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun slapped Kim Suho on the shoulder several times and grinned.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be fine. Grandpa is here. He’s gonna take care of that.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was as confident as Kim Hajin had been before. The difference was that her confidence was proven almost immediately.</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>The surrounding nature resonated.</p>
<p>Grass, trees, the earth, all colors of nature became clearer and began to spur. They quickly gathered together to form a huge human figure.</p>
<p>This was the avatar of the Immortal made by Chae Joochul with his Authority.</p>
<p>The avatar straightened herself up. She was as big as Morax.</p>
<p>“…Wow. I haven’t seen this technique in a while.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun blurted in admiration. Kim Suho looked up at Mother Nature in a daze. Her legs were trees and soil intertwined, her body was made of Chae Joochul’s magic power, and her arms and head inherited the energy of the azure sky.</p>
<p>This was the great ‘Four-colored Immortal’.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s just leave him to Grandpa.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun slapped Kim Suho on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Morax began moving towards the Immortal. He stretched his arms towards the divine creation, and the Immortal did the same. The two great forces crashed into each other, causing a devastating shock wave.</p>
<p><em>KWaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Submerged in the wave of gravity pushing against his whole body, Kim Suho grabbed his sword.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Vassago’s Colosseum]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon became Rank 9 Gladiators. But Jin Seyeon’s heart was not in the Colosseum anymore. She had just discovered that the Demon Realm Gate opened and devils descended on Earth….</p>
<p>“You need to pee? Whatcha nervous for?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungeyong sneered at Jin Seyeon as she wandered about the waiting room.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon turned to him with a frown.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you worried at all?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“Devils have descended on Earth! This is the biggest crisis in the history of humanity since the Great Change. Yet, you’re-”</p>
<p>“Say, what do you think we’re doing right now? Are we just playing around?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“We’re also trying to stop a devil, are we not?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon fell silent. She had nothing to counter him with. It was true that they were here to protect humanity from a devil.</p>
<p>Not knowing what else to say, she glared at Cheok Jungyeong, sighed, and threw herself on the couch.</p>
<p>“But still. Four devils have appeared at once. Four! Morax, Baal, Phenex, Vual-”</p>
<p>“What? Ball?”</p>
<p>“No, no, not ball, Baal. The pronunciation is similar, but…. Wait, stop fooling around!”</p>
<p>Cheko Jungyeong’s sordid joke angered Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>A bird appeared from nowhere. It fluttered its wings and landed on Cheok Jungeyong’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“…What’s this?”</p>
<p>Cheko Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon looked at the bird in a daze. The bird tilted its head a couple of times, and…</p>
<p>—Peep.</p>
<p>…Chirped.</p>
<p>At the same time, a sentence rose above the beak of the bird.</p>
<p>[My name is Observer No.3]</p>
<p>It was a rather sassy self-introduction.</p>
<p>“…What? Observer?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungeyong frowned, and <em>peep—</em>, the bird chirped again.</p>
<p>[I shall help you communicate with my master]</p>
<p>“Haha. You’re pretty feisty for a little guy. Just who is your master…?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong shuddered slightly as if he had suddenly realized something. Jin Seyeon stared at Cheok Jungyeong who had frozen in place.</p>
<p>“…Aha.”</p>
<p>After organizing his thoughts, Cheok Jungyeong let out a chuckle. He lightly patted the head of the Observer on his shoulder and gestured at Jin Seyeon to come near him.</p>
<p>“Oi, come here.”</p>
<p>“What is that?” Jin Seyeon asked brusquely.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong answered, “It’s a messenger from the Seat of Black.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon flinched.</p>
<p>She continued to wander about the room, pretending to be indifferent.</p>
<p>“Seat of Black?”</p>
<p>“Yup. Oi, Black. Are you currently outside? I’m with Jin Seyeon right now.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong whispered to the Observer. About 3 minutes later, the bird chirped, relaying Black Lotus’s message to him.</p>
<p>[Yes, I’m outside. But things aren’t looking too great. Where are you right now, Cheok Jungyeong?]</p>
<p>“At Vassago Colosseum.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon focused all her senses on the conversation between Cheok Jungyeong and Black Lotus, all the while feigning indifference.</p>
<p>[How are things on your side? Will you two be able to beat Vassago?]</p>
<p>“Of course, I can kill him easily. My companion here, on the other hand, wants to appease.”</p>
<p>[Huh? She wants to appease a devil?]</p>
<p>“Yup. Sounds crazy, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, but I-”</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong stopped Jin Seyeon.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s face was distorted like a bulldog, yet Cheok Jungyeong continued smugly, paying no mind to her apparent discomfort.</p>
<p>[Does she have a plan?]</p>
<p>“I don’t know, she says that Vassago loves treasures or something. So she wants to appease him with the items you made. You know, stuff like furniture. Nonsense, right?”</p>
<p>[Mm… you’re right, that sounds a little reckless. It’s not much of a plan.]</p>
<p>Black Lotus’s disapproval made Jin Seyeon blush with embarrassment.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>—So far, six gladiators have achieved Rank 9.</p>
<p>Vassago’s voice descended from the ceiling of the Colosseum. Cheok Jungyeong quickly hid the Observer, and Jin Seyeon looked up at the ceiling with a nervous expression.</p>
<p>—The last match shall begin two days from now.</p>
<p>Six gladiators have achieved Rank 9.</p>
<p>Vassago boldly announced that he would fight against all six of them at once.</p>
<p>“Here, hand the bird over to me.”</p>
<p>After the announcement ended, Jin Seyeon stretched her arm towards Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>At that moment, however, Vassago interfered again.</p>
<p>—And, you two.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon flinched.</p>
<p>They weren’t too worried, however. Vassago had announced before that the gladiators were free to plot and scheme against him in the Colosseum. So the Observer shouldn’t be a problem….</p>
<p>—Your tribute was well received.</p>
<p>As expected.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon gave a sigh of relief and leered at Cheok Jungeyong as if saying ‘Told you this would work.’</p>
<p>—There’s someone on Earth who can make things like this? You’re saying that a human-made such a delicate object?</p>
<p>“Apparently, according to him.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon pointed at Cheok Jungyeong with her chin rather coldly. Cheok Jungyeong shrugged, and then pulled out the Observer hidden behind his back.</p>
<p>“Take a look at this. This is a bird he sculpted with his magic power. You can tell how talented he is, no?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungeyong set the bird free. The Observer chirped as it fluttered around the ceiling. The way that the small bird danced like a butterfly was pretty cute.</p>
<p>—Hmm….</p>
<p>Vassago observed the bird in silence.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon whispered, “See? It’s working.”</p>
<p>“So what? I also thought this was a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Stop lying.”</p>
<p>“Why,” Cheok Jungyeong added with an unusually serious look. “I had our members investigate, and they told me that Vassago’s incarnation body used to be super extravagant. So it’s no surprise that Vassago is blinded by riches, just like his incarnation bo-”</p>
<p>—I can hear you.</p>
<p>Vassago declared coldly.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon fell silent.</p>
<p>The devil continued with a chuckle.</p>
<p>—Though I cannot say that the incarnation body’s inclination has not affected me at all. As you intended, your tribute has satisfied me greatly. I’ll visit you soon. It is only natural for a greater being to award lower being’s good behavior. You shall wait for me.</p>
<p>This was the answer that Jin Seyeon had been waiting for.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 347. Meeting (4)</p>
<p>Eren started as a squire under Puharen’s order of knights as his master had offered a knight’s ‘oath of guarantee’.</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn’t easy. As a squire, his main duty was cleaning and cooking, and he only had an hour before sleep to practice his sword.</p>
<p>But Eren didn’t give up. In fact, he saw everything optimistically. Though he was young, his well-built body allowed him to perform menial tasks without getting tired, and he considered watching powerful knights train as a great learning opportunity. Eren gave his all in what little time he had every night to train.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Puharen’s knights didn’t ignore the boy’s effort. It didn’t take long until Eren was invited to train along with the others.</p>
<p>Although the knight society was rough and crude, Eren was able to grow quickly because of it.</p>
<p>But luck was far from Eren’s tale. As if meeting his master used up all his luck, he stopped being graced by it.</p>
<p>Soon, Eren found out that his master was sick with an incurable illness. It was why he was pushed away to Eren’s rural village in the first place. Eren’s master had wanted to experience a wider world with the time he had remaining.</p>
<p>It was during his travels that he found the most perfect disciple and returned to the small world of the capital.</p>
<p>Although the master was happy, Eren was distressed. Eren was stronger than others his age, but he was still a child at heart. It was too soon for eternal farewells, and he couldn’t hide the pain in his heart.</p>
<p>Eren visited his master every night, watching him weaken on what would be his death bed.</p>
<p>Then one day, as Eren was swallowing his tears next to his master, he met a princess named ‘Prihi’.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Earth – Korea]</p>
<p>I sent Observers all over the world to collect information. It didn’t take long for me to realize that the situation was far worse than what I had imagined.</p>
<p>—Oi, Black, wait there. Red over here is about to begin an important battle. I’ll contact you later.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon, who entered Vassago’s Colosseum, seemed to have their own plan. But Earth’s society was crumbling under the great evil that descended.</p>
<p>[A devil has descended in Tokyo. This bird-shaped devil who calls itself ‘Phenex’ has begun to sing a song of death in Tokyo’s sky…]</p>
<p>[‘Vual’ is knocking on the walls of Vladivostok…]</p>
<p>“Spartan?”</p>
<p>Spartan appeared as soon as I called him, gently landing on my shoulder. He seemed a bit bigger than the last time I saw him.</p>
<p>—Prrrrr</p>
<p>Spartan purred and acted cutely. I smiled bitterly and stroked his head.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to play around.</p>
<p><em>Guooooooo….</em></p>
<p>A huge amount of magic power began to erupt from Morax’s spot of descent. It wasn’t a devil’s demonic energy, but the clean magic power of nature. This four-colored magic power clashed with Morax’s energy.</p>
<p>I instantly knew this was Chae Joochul’s power.</p>
<p>—Where are you?</p>
<p>At that moment, Yoo Yeonha’s voice rang out from my smartwatch.</p>
<p>“I’m watching Morax. What about you?”</p>
<p>I replied as I took out [Black Lotus’s Bow]</p>
<p>—I’m in an underground bunker.</p>
<p>“Did you find out what’s happening?”</p>
<p>—Mostly. It looks like Earth is on the brink of destruction.</p>
<p>“…Oh yeah?”</p>
<p>I chuckled. She wasn’t completely wrong since Baal had once destroyed a world in three days. Since he should have spent the first day summoning his subordinates like he was doing now, the actual time he took the destroy that world was probably less.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>I sighed and checked my Stigma. As I thought, I didn’t have even a single ounce of it left.</p>
<p>Because of [Time Reversal]’s side-effect, it was slow to recover even with the [Orb of Regeneration]. I could use Overclocking to forcefully create more… but I would have to wait for a good time to do so.</p>
<p>—How are things on your side? I thought you’d know something.</p>
<p>“Ah, well… I don’t, really.”</p>
<p>—Then I guess we’re doomed. Because I can’t think of anything.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha sent the information she collected over the smartwatch.</p>
<p>Russia, Vladivostok – Vual</p>
<p>Japan, Tokyo – Phenex</p>
<p>Spain, Madrid – Astaroth</p>
<p>All of Europe – Valac’s Army</p>
<p>Korea – Baal and Morax</p>
<p>Thankfully, Leraje and Vassago seemed less hostile. Other devils were like boss monsters, but these two were like quests.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to come up with something. I’ll let you know once I do.”</p>
<p>—Got it.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Morax’s arm and the Immortal’s fist clashed. A huge shockwave spread out in all directions, and Aether created a barrier around me automatically.</p>
<p>Immediately afterward, a golden flash of light and a huge blade of magic power cut through the air. Kim Suho and Chae Nayun had joined the battle.</p>
<p>I raised [Black Lotus’s Bow] as I continued to watch them. As [Athena’s Mystic Arrow] was destroyed when it toppled Baal’s castle, I nocked a dark ore arrow.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>A woman’s voice suddenly flowed into my ears. My head cooled down instantly, and I rolled my eyes over to the side.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em> I swallowed hard and checked the woman’s face. Then, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Geez, you surprised me.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha.”</p>
<p>The woman laughed playfully as she poked my cheeks. I took a step back and glared at her.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>It was Medea.</p>
<p>After appearing out of the blue, she handed me a piece of paper.</p>
<p>“Here, take it.”</p>
<p>“What’s this? Rather than that, go help them fight Morax. You haven’t forgotten about our contract, right?”</p>
<p>“It’s a message from Crevon.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>I looked down at the paper. I quickly snatched it from Medea’s hand and scanned it.</p>
<p>[Have you been well, Kim Hajin? This is Crevon Empire’s Duchess, Tomer. That’s right, we’re no longer a kingdom, but an empire…]</p>
<p>Medea spoke as I was reading the message.</p>
<p>“I read it too. To summarize, Crevon wants to help, but it seems like they’re not in a situation to do so.”</p>
<p>“W-Why?”</p>
<p>Medea shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“They’re powerless. To be exact, they don’t have the energy necessary to leave the Tower and descend on Earth.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“I spent hundreds of years preparing for my descent. That’s how hard it is to leave that place. How annoying. I came here after all that effort and look at this place….”</p>
<p>Medea’s explanation quickly devolved into her grumbling about her misfortunes. I, of course, ignored most of it. There was only one thing in my mind at this moment.</p>
<p>[Dimensional Entropy]</p>
<p>A source of energy powerful enough to allow Crevon’s army to descend to Earth.</p>
<p>“What a shame, I thought I’d get to enjoy a longer life this time—”</p>
<p>Ignoring Medea, who was still complaining away, I called Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Yoo Yeonha, are you there?”</p>
<p>A clattering sound rang out before Yoo Yeonha finally replied.</p>
<p>—…Yes?</p>
<p>“What were you doing? Planting an apple tree?”</p>
<p>—W-What? N-No, do you think I’m an idiot? An apple tree, ha, haha.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Her strange reaction made me a bit curious, but that wasn’t the important part right now.</p>
<p>“Alright, listen to me.”</p>
<p>—Huh? Ah.. okay.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha quickly became serious. I paused for a moment and turned to Medea.</p>
<p>“Medea-ssi, can you pass this message to Crevon for me?”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Russia – Vladivostok]</p>
<p>Russia’s city, Vladivostok, was peaceful just yesterday. It was fine even when Valac’s army was invading Europe and Earth was experiencing a rapid Demon Realm Transformation.</p>
<p>Vladivostok was geographically close to Korea and due to the high number of Dungeons it had, it was a strategic location visited by many of Korea’s large guilds. Recently, people’s assessment of Vladivostok had risen greatly to the point it outclassed Moscow, Russia’s capital. Many key government facilities had even moved to Vladivostok.</p>
<p>The reason was simple. During the past six months where Earth was wrapped in chaos, Vladivostok became famous as a safe haven.</p>
<p>Russian Heroes, advanced technology, and the well-known ‘Vladivostok Walls’ weren’t the reason for this change.</p>
<p>It was because the monsters in its area had been wiped clean by an unknown force. Vladivostok’s residents called this mysterious force their guardian deity. Unsurprisingly, dozens of temples, shrines, and churches had been built in the city to worship this unknown god.</p>
<p>Vladivostok’s residents and the Russian government wished for these miracles to continue and hoped that this guardian deity would protect them from all evils.</p>
<p>…However, Russia’s most famous Hero, Gennadi, thought today would be the last day of this mysterious protection.</p>
<p>“…Sir Gennadi, we’re awaiting your command.”</p>
<p>Gennadi was looking down from Vladivostok’s impenetrable wall. On the other side were a huge army and a caped devil commanding it.</p>
<p>“So that’s Vual…”</p>
<p>Gennadi grit his teeth. He knew there was nothing he could do against such a powerful force. His mind began to imagine Vladivostok being razed by the endless sea of an army in front of him.</p>
<p>—Open the gate.</p>
<p>At that moment, the devil’s hoarse voice rang out across the horizon. The voice carried a hint of demonic energy, shaking the walls and causing ordinary soldiers to collapse.</p>
<p>—I will say it three times only.</p>
<p>Gennadi fell in thought. He couldn’t imagine Vual sparing them even if they opened the gate.</p>
<p>—Open the gate.</p>
<p>Gennadi began to hate himself for his powerlessness.</p>
<p>—Open the….</p>
<p>But at that moment, the devil’s eerie voice suddenly cut off.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew, and Gennadi raised his head.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaaa—</em></p>
<p>The gust was cutting Vual’s army apart. Soon, the gust turned into a storm, and the formation of Vual’s army was thrown into disarray.</p>
<p><em>Boom—!</em></p>
<p>Vual’s soldiers screamed in pain as violent winds cut their limbs apart. Even Vual had no choice but to scan the area for a clue.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>In the middle of the battlefield, he found a loach squirming around faster than the speed of sound.</p>
<p>“A mutt?”</p>
<p>That’s what Vual thought. He tried to grab the mutt using his demonic energy, but it squirmed away.</p>
<p>“…You!”</p>
<p>Vual furrowed his brows. His demonic energy split into multiple branches, chasing after the mutt.</p>
<p>The mutt ran but was eventually caught by the demonic energy hurling from all directions. No, that’s what everyone thought at first.</p>
<p><em>Plunk—!</em></p>
<p>A thud rang out, and the demonic energy was struck back. Neither magic power nor demonic energy was at work. The ‘mutt’ had only used its ‘strength’ to do so.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Vual couldn’t understand what he was seeing. He stopped attacking and simply observed the mutt.</p>
<p>—Krrrr, Krrrr</p>
<p>He caught a closer glimpse of the mutt – a praying mantis with a strange cry.</p>
<p>However, Vual ignored the bipedal insect.</p>
<p>“You dare look at me with such eyes.”</p>
<p>Instead, he looked at the existence watching him from behind the mantis. He couldn’t stand the condescending look of that existence.</p>
<p>“…Answer me.”</p>
<p>The devil commanded. However, the existence remained silent. Its arrogant eyes also remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The existence standing behind the mantis was a lonely king with only one vassal – Orden.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 348. Meeting (5)</p>
<p>Prihi asked Eren why he was crying. Eren wiped away his tears and told her he wasn’t. Prihi smiled, but Eren couldn’t. Prihi looked at Eren’s sword tied to his waist. Eren slowly turned the sword behind his back.</p>
<p>Prihi asked, “Your name?”</p>
<p>Eren answered, “I’m Eren, a knight.”</p>
<p>“I see. I’ve heard of you.”</p>
<p>The princess nodded as if their meeting had been purely coincidental. In truth, rumors about a young knight named Eren had been circulating in the Royal Palace for some time. Even Romero, Prihi’s henchman, praised the young knight, saying, “If he had been born 10 years earlier, the fate of our kingdom would’ve changed.”</p>
<p>Prihi was greedy. She wanted a strong knight who matched her ambition.</p>
<p>“I heard your master is sick.”</p>
<p>Prihi asked. This time, Eren hesitated to answer.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Though he remained silent, young Eren couldn’t help but hope for a miracle. Puharen, who he had sworn allegiance to, had given up his master’s treatment. Puharen’s servant came in person and said, “We’re short of finances and time.”</p>
<p>Eren was disappointed but had no choice but to understand. Since his master understood, Eren had to, too.</p>
<p>Prihi asked again. “Is he sick or not? I haven’t heard the answer yet.”</p>
<p>“…He is sick.” Eren nodded.</p>
<p>Prihi opened the door of the room where Eren had just left. Eren followed the princess. Because Eren was big for his age and the princess was the opposite, she was much smaller than Eren.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Prihi looked at Eren’s master lying in his bed. She knew this knight, who had been reduced to nothing short of a skeleton.</p>
<p>‘Jinkens.’</p>
<p>A trivial knight whose limitations were clear from the start. He started at the bottom and remained there for all of his life. Still, she considered him useful, for he had brought a boy of great talent to the royal capital.</p>
<p>“I know him. Jinkens, a loyal servant.”</p>
<p>Prihi gazed kindly at Jinkens.</p>
<p>“I heard that he has served the royal family for nearly 20 years. I’m sure the former king would recognize him as well….”</p>
<p>As Prihi’s voice grew softer, Eren’s expectations deepened. Maybe Prihi would help his master.</p>
<p>‘If so, should I ask her for help, or should I wait for her to make the first move?’ Eren wondered.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the princess turned her gaze to Eren.</p>
<p>“Young knight.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, your highness.”</p>
<p>Eren kneeled before the princess and lowered his head. Prihi could feel the anticipation and excitement rise from Eren. The sly princess hid her smile and spoke with a determined look.</p>
<p>“I shall help you.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Eren’s heart burst with joy. The condition that followed—’But only if you pledge to serve me from now on’—was easily overlooked.</p>
<p>Eren looked up at Prihi under the pale moonlight. The young princess was shining in brilliant silver.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Earth — Korea]</p>
<p>I sent Yoo Yeonha the coordinates for the Tower of Miracle. After a moment of silence, Yoo Yeonha switched to video call. The big screen that suddenly popped up was full of Yoo Yeonha’s face. I reduced the screen size in a hurry.</p>
<p>—Why here, all of a sudden? This is the Tower of Miracle, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha frowned, pointing at the coordinates I had just sent. It was clear that she hadn’t yet understood my intentions.</p>
<p>“Oh, Medea is with me, by the way.”</p>
<p>I adjusted the angle of the smartwatch to show Medea. Medea smiled calmly and waved, and Yoo Yeonha flinched.</p>
<p>—What the… why is Medea there…?</p>
<p>“She brought me an official letter from Crevon. You should read it first.”</p>
<p>I scanned the letter with my smartwatch and sent it to Yoo Yeonha. Yoo Yeonha, after reading the letter, opened her eyes wide even before I could start explaining. She was quick to understand, as always.</p>
<p>—…This.</p>
<p>“Yeah. You understand what’s going on, right?”</p>
<p>Tomer wrote in the letter, “Queen Araha conquered the 9th floor, proclaimed Crevon an empire and became the Empress. She wants to help you, but there is no energy left in the Tower that we can use for the descent. Does Earth have that kind of energy?”</p>
<p>And that kind of energy did exist on Earth.</p>
<p>—Are you thinking about using the Dimensional Entropy?</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>I snapped my fingers.</p>
<p>[Dimensional Entropy].</p>
<p>Even the name seemed to hasten its use.</p>
<p>“If we provide energy to the Tower with it, we could temporarily form a passage.”</p>
<p>—Mm… give me a moment.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeoha inside the screen began to think. Not in a normal way, obviously. Her eyes turned blue, and her hair stood on end as if they had become static. All this was due to Yoo Yeonha’s special skill that increased her ability to think logically.</p>
<p>About 3 minutes later.</p>
<p>—I don’t know if it’ll work because I don’t have enough information. I can’t calculate properly. …But I guess this is our only option. I’ll do it.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded resolutely, and I threw a glance at Medea.</p>
<p>“Medea, please head back to Crevon and adjust the time.”</p>
<p>Before carrying out a summon of this size, our time must first align with that of Crevon. Crevon would also need some time to prepare an army.</p>
<p>“…Will it be alright?”</p>
<p>Medea asked, clearly doubtful.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’ll definitely work. But you have to hurry.”</p>
<p>We were still under the influence of my ‘Accumulation of Luck’.</p>
<p>Also, I still had some luck left for one last use.</p>
<p>“Okay, well, if you’re so sure.”</p>
<p>Medea quickly recited a spell. <em>Ssssssss-</em> After the recitation, which was so quick that I could have mistaken it for wind, Medea disappeared.</p>
<p>“Phew….”</p>
<p>I calmed myself down with a deep breath and turned my gaze to Spartan on my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Spartan.”</p>
<p>—Pururu.</p>
<p>Spartan read my thoughts and nodded before I could speak.</p>
<p>I smiled and said my orders aloud nonetheless.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Yoo Yeonha.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Vassago’s Colosseum — Arena]</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon stared at the woman in front of them.</p>
<p>There were at the throne room, a place just for Vassago, built at the highest point of the Colosseum. This was where the last challenger would have faced Vassago during their final duel.</p>
<p>Right now, however, Cheok Jungyeong and Jin Seyeon were looking at Vassago peacefully. They felt neither threatened nor scared, but only confused at Vassago’s appearance. Not only did Vassago seem weak, but she was also beautiful, a quality that did not necessarily matter to devils.</p>
<p>Her long blue hair danced like waves in the ocean, her nose and mouth were in harmony like the moon and the stars in the sky, and her eyes sparkled as if they contained all the light of the world.</p>
<p>“…Hmph.”</p>
<p>No words could properly describe such beauty. Feeling her confidence vanish, Jin Seyeon glanced at Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong’s eyes were on Vassago. He clearly had no regard for manners or self-control. Jin Seyeon pinched Cheok Jungyeong, but her nails couldn’t do any damage to his body full of muscles.</p>
<p>“I liked it a lot.”</p>
<p>It was then that Vassago finally spoke.</p>
<p>“What did you like?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon asked carefully. Vassago gave a smirk and tapped on the throne twice. The chair was made by Black Lotus, which Cheok Jungyeong had dedicated(?) to Vassago.</p>
<p>“This chair. I liked it a lot.”</p>
<p>Vassago seemed truly satisfied. Jin Seyeon nodded, holding back a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“…I’m glad to hear that.”</p>
<p>“Is it true that you own a lot of these things?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Lord Vassago. So why don’t you negotiate with us? On Earth, there is an artisan who can make items that are much more valuable than that chair.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s voice was serious. But Vassago only shrugged.</p>
<p>“Why should I negotiate, when I can just kill you all and have the artisan to myself?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon had expected this objection. She countered immediately.</p>
<p>“Then the artisan would refuse to work for you.”</p>
<p>“That’s a fair argument. But what if I threaten to kill him? Isn’t death what you mortal beings are most afraid of?”</p>
<p>“Baal is trying to destroy the entire world anyway. The artisan knows that even if you don’t kill him, he’ll be murdered by Baal.”</p>
<p>“…Haha.”</p>
<p>Vassago smiled.</p>
<p>The relationship between Vassago and Baal wasn’t exactly hierarchical. Though Baal was ranked first, Vassago was ranked third and almost equally influential.</p>
<p>“Do not underestimate me. I can freely collect things I want, regardless of Baal.”</p>
<p>Vassago rose from the throne. At that moment Cheok Jungyeong scanned Vassago from head to toe. Her beauty was so extraterrestrial that no human could dare to judge it. “Ohhh-” Cheok Jungyeong admired out loud.</p>
<p>This upset Vassago and she sat back in her chair.</p>
<p>“But your strategy was good. I am indeed a devil with the desire to collect.”</p>
<p>Vassago pulled out an accessory. This time, it was a ring made not by Black Lotus but a different craftsman from another dimension.</p>
<p>Vassago stared at her ring, mesmerized by its beauty.</p>
<p>“Collecting beautiful things is a more important hobby than my life.”</p>
<p>“…Than your life?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon frowned. The fact that the devil had revealed her weakness so easily puzzled the Hero.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a high-end hobby among devils. Low-ranking devils think murder and destruction are the only forms of entertainment, but nobles like me are different. I don't necessarily enjoy destruction. That is unless you start to behave cocky and arrogant.”</p>
<p>At that moment Jin Seyeon’s face was distorted.</p>
<p>“Then, what about Baal? He’s-”</p>
<p>“Baal’s just like me in a sense. He has the desire to collect different worlds. But I’m different. My hobby is collecting beauty. So…”</p>
<p>Vassago stopped and looked down at Jin Seyeon and Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“I am willing to negotiate. But under one condition— you must offer me an accessory that I’ll not get sick of for at least 100 years and will fill me with joy just by looking at it.”</p>
<p>Vassago crossed her legs declaring so.</p>
<p>Soon came a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon swallowed her saliva and Cheok Jungyeong yawned.</p>
<p>“…If you like the product we’ve given you, what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon asked, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>Vassago gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“This incarnation body probably has about 100 years left. During those 100 years, I will stay here without causing any harm to Earth.”</p>
<p>“Here… do you mean the Colosseum?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I'll wait for challengers here at the Colosseum for the next 100 years. I'll even offer challengers entertainment and rewards. My warehouse is crawling with valuable weapons, after all. And when this body dies, I'll go back to the transcendental realm without hesitation.”</p>
<p>The proposal was too good to be true. It was perhaps the best they could obtain through negotiation. Jin Seyeon looked at Cheok Jungyeong. Their eyes met.</p>
<p>Slowly, Jin Seyeon nodded her head.</p>
<p>“…We accept.”</p>
<p>“Good. Then I’ll give you three days. I’ll not cooperate with Baal in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Three, three days are too short!”</p>
<p>Three days. Jin Seyeon was appalled by the pressing deadline. But Vassago was adamant. It was then that Cheok Jungyeong came forward.</p>
<p>“By the way, Devil.”</p>
<p>“…Devil?”</p>
<p>As Vassago frowned at his insolent remark, Cheok Jungyeong gave a wide grin.</p>
<p>“Our duel is still happening, right?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong had no intention of giving up his duel with Vassago. His determination to fight was expressed outwardly in the form of sparks of magic power that surrounded Cheok Jungyeong’s body.</p>
<p>“Huh….”</p>
<p>Vassago stared blankly at Cheok Jungyeong. However, she soon replaced her dumbfounded expression with a gentle smile. It meant ‘Yes’.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Russia — Vladivostok]</p>
<p>Devil Vual looked at his army. It was made up of soldiers who had served him since he was in the Demon Realm. His mighty army should have been able to wipe out the group of weaklings without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Yet….</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The devil couldn't understand what was happening. He couldn't believe the scene unfolding before his eyes. The devil stared ahead, dazed, trapped at the boundary between reality and illusion.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>The beam of magic power spewing out from the palms of the enemy swept the battlefield. Every demon in its trajectory was burned alive.</p>
<p>As a counterattack, Vual’s army poured demonic energy at the enemy. A huge ball of demonic energy flew towards him, shaking both heaven and earth. But the enemy swiftly absorbed the ball of energy into his body and returned it to the demons with even greater strength.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa…!</em></p>
<p>He fired a blast of Ki from his hand. The soldiers swept away by the blast were scattered in droves of ash.</p>
<p>Only about five minutes after the battle began, a third of Vual’s army had already been wiped out. The enemy kept releasing an enormous amount of magic power, but he didn’t seem to grow tired at all. He was overpowering the entire army by himself.</p>
<p>Still, the devil couldn’t admit to the reality of the situation. He refused to admit. How could such a lowly being defeat his army…?</p>
<p>“…You—!”</p>
<p>At last Vual shouted, unable to bear any more humiliation. His voice shook the earth. The devil’s wrath stopped all movement on the battlefield, and Orden turned his gaze to Vual.</p>
<p>“Who are you?!” Vual asked.</p>
<p>His eyes were bloodshot and his body was shaking with rage. He was a transcendent devil but also a poor soul more easily angered than mere humans.</p>
<p>Orden pitied the devil.</p>
<p>“I said, who are you—!?”</p>
<p>The devil’s cry tore the atmosphere apart.</p>
<p>Orden answered nonchalantly, “I don’t remember allowing you to ask questions.”</p>
<p>“W-what? How dare you speak that way, you hybrid-”</p>
<p>Vual could not accept this nonsense. He no longer could endure his enemy’s insolence. Extreme rage began to overtake him.</p>
<p>"But devil, I have a question for you.”</p>
<p>But Orden continued, thoroughly ignoring Vual's apparent anger.</p>
<p>"You introduced yourself as a devil. Then I'm sure you've lived for a long time."</p>
<p>A devil lives for hundreds and thousands of years.</p>
<p>Then, during those long years, had the devil seen anything similar to him?</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen anything like me?"</p>
<p>Orden wondered about that.</p>
<p>But the devil seemed unwilling to answer. In his defense, he was in no state to think or reason. Vual’s nickname was 'The Devil of Wrath'. He had already been consumed with rage.</p>
<p>“…Groak, pril, ashack—!”</p>
<p>Vual, unable to contain his anger, made a strange sound and released his demonic energy at Orden.</p>
<p>A massive wave of demonic energy split the earth in half. It flew like a dragon towards Orden, and Orden countered it with his fist.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 349. Pieces (1)</p>
<p>Even after Eren pledged allegiance to Prihi, not much changed. As usual, Eren was keen on training, and Puharen was still stuck in his room. There was only one noticeable change: a small pill would find its way to Eren every night.</p>
<p>Prihi stuck to her promise to help Eren’s master and ordered her servant to deliver medicine to Eren every night. Deeply grateful, Eren gave the medicine to his teacher.</p>
<p>As each day passed, Eren’s master recovered his health, and Eren grew rapidly. The boy was now skilled enough to compete against an adult. Though of course, his opponent used a wooden sword, whereas Eren used a real sword.</p>
<p>Those were the happy days.</p>
<p>Then, one night.</p>
<p>Eren, who returned home after his usual training routine, delivered the medicine to his master as usual and shared a rather pleasant conversation with the recovering patient. He then went back to his room.</p>
<p>“Huaaa….”</p>
<p>Eren sat in a chair and looked outside the window. Suddenly, a sense of fulfillment began to overtake him. Some would describe this feeling as happiness, or joy.</p>
<p>Eren put his hand on his chest and smiled.</p>
<p>“Ah, right.”</p>
<p>Now that everything was under control, Eren remembered something he had forgotten— namely, the nuns who had cared for him.</p>
<p>Eren took out a paper and a pen and began writing. He wanted to let the nuns know how well he was doing so that they wouldn’t have to worry about him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[To the Temple of Kterin]</p>
<p>Hello, this is Eren. How are you? Master and I are well. The Royal Palace is so big and amazing. I get to eat on time, and my sword skills are improving, too. Every day is a happy day.</p>
<p>But sometimes it hurts when I think of you. I miss you a lot….</p>
<p>Today I received a stipend. They don’t usually pay the squires, but I think I got it because I worked hard. I’m sending it to you because it’s useless to me anyway. Please use it well. I’ll keep the letters coming. Thank you for everything.</p>
<p>May the grace of the Lord always be with you.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Eren sealed the letter with two gold coins, a stipend he had received from Prihi, in an envelope. The bottom of the envelope was considerably thickened by the coins.</p>
<p>“Huhu….”</p>
<p>Eren looked at the letter with satisfaction. He stayed that way for quite some time until scarlet light began penetrating his window.</p>
<p>The light was at first about the size of a firefly. It quickly grew bigger as it passed through the window and shone brightly on Eren’s face.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Eren looked out the window with his head tilted.</p>
<p>“What the….”</p>
<p>Under the night sky, in the garden of the Royal Palace, an army of soldiers stood with torches in their hands. They were fully armed and clearly hostile, trampling on the grass and the flowers in the garden.</p>
<p>Eren quickly grabbed his sword and stood up.</p>
<p>“…Ah?”</p>
<p>However, when he saw the small figure at the center of the army, he paused.</p>
<p>Eren and his master’s benefactor, Prihi, was there.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Orden woke up in a cave.</p>
<p>He saw the light from a lamp swaying faintly over the surface of the stone ceiling.</p>
<p>Orden couldn’t grasp the situation. He remembered he had felt this same way when he first gained intelligence. Just the fact that he was alive confused Orden.</p>
<p>—Kururu. Kururu.</p>
<p>At that moment, he heard Kurukuru’s voice. Orden slowly turned to the direction that the voice had come from. Kurukuru was kneeling beside him.</p>
<p>—Kururu….</p>
<p>Kurukuru was apologizing. He felt guilty that he had disobeyed the king’s orders and saved his life. But the humanoid monster did not regret his decision. In fact, Kurukuru was prepared to die. He was prepared to take his own life if the king wished for him to do so.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Orden stared at Kurukuru in silence. He read his servant’s memory. All the things that Kurukuru had done over the years slowly seeped into Orden.</p>
<p>Kurukuru traveled all over the world to save Orden. He did everything he could do to get his hands on the ingredients for spirit medicine, such as ginseng, herbs, ores and seagrass. Sometimes he even stole from others.</p>
<p>In the process, Kurukuru cut off the Kraken’s leg, broke into the Tower of Heroes, pulled out an Ancient Dire Wolf’s Teeth, and purchased the skin of a Basilisk.</p>
<p>He crossed mountains, explored the seas, ran through jungles, wandered through deserts, and dove into boiling magma.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he lost his arms, became blind, and his antennae burned down. But none of that mattered to Kurukuru.</p>
<p>If only he could save the king.</p>
<p>If only he could be with him again.</p>
<p>The servant was willing to give his own life for it.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>After taking in Kurukuru’s memory, Orden suddenly realized that he had become smaller. He was still larger than an average human, but slightly smaller than three humans combined. His horns, which he had managed with care, were gone, too.</p>
<p>Because of this, his body didn’t feel too heavy.</p>
<p>Orden stood up without saying a word. He moved his stiff legs and stepped forward. The soil beneath his feet felt soft, for Kurukuru had managed the cave with care.</p>
<p>Orden set foot in the world outside the cave.</p>
<p>The dazzling blue sky greeted him. The sun poured down on him. The harmony of the clouds, the sun, and the moon in the sky were beautiful.</p>
<p>Orden stood in absolute stillness and felt the nature surrounding him.</p>
<p>The salty wind, the rolling waves, the rustling leaves, and the golden sand of the beach.</p>
<p>His eyes captured them all.</p>
<p>“This is strange.”</p>
<p>A chuckle escaped Orden’s lips. He had never looked so closely at nature. He was never really interested in it. Before, all he did was fight and kill in search of his own existence.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap.</em></p>
<p>At that moment, he heard quiet footsteps approaching.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap.</em></p>
<p>Kurukuru, his only servant, stood beside him.</p>
<p>Orden did not turn to face his servant, however. Kurukuru, too, stayed silent. The two monsters stood still and looked at the horizon. They stayed that way for a very long time until all the time they had spent apart had been paid for.</p>
<p>…That was a long time ago when Orden first came back to life.</p>
<p>Lost in old memories, Orden looked up at Vladivostok’s blue sky,</p>
<p>—Kuaaaa, kuaaaa</p>
<p>But a strange sound disturbed his recollection. Orden lowered his head and looked at the origin of the painful groan.</p>
<p>Bual, the devil who had attacked him with obstinate arrogance, was now lying on the ground. He had no arms. He still had one leg left, but it was folded at a strange angle. His stomach was torn and blood and organs were pouring out of it.</p>
<p>Bual had lost completely. His army, which at one point in time seemed to cover the entire surface of the earth, had been annihilated as well.</p>
<p>Orden had destroyed the devil’s army by himself.</p>
<p>—You, you insolent fool… how dare you….</p>
<p>Despite the situation, Bual had yet to surrender. Orden gazed at Bual. In Bual’s bloodshot eyes and angry gestures, Orden could see his old self.</p>
<p>Orden felt ashamed of himself, so much so that he wanted to teach this transcendent being what he himself had learned. At that moment Orden realized that he and the devil might be similar in some respects, despite the difference in years they had lived to date.</p>
<p>Orden looked down at Bual and spoke.</p>
<p>“I feel sorry for you. Do not ever wonder about yourself again. That will put your mind at ease.”</p>
<p>—Shut your mouth!</p>
<p>Bual spat at Orden. The cursed mixture of saliva and blood, however, fell to the ground without ever reaching Orden.</p>
<p>—You, I’ll remember you! I’ll kill you no matter what! Even if I die right here, I’ll definitely-</p>
<p>“People live because they’re alive. Do not search for a deeper meaning.”</p>
<p>—Shut up! Shut up! You-</p>
<p>Orden swung his fist.</p>
<p><em>Crack—!</em> With the sound of an explosion, the devil’s head disappeared.</p>
<p>Orden shook his fist and turned around. He was no longer a king, so he was not obliged to teach anyone who was unwilling to learn.</p>
<p>Orden sighed and looked up at the sky, surrounded by the stillness of the forest. His gaze traveled downward. An artificial wall stood tall amidst the green of nature. Orden stared at the very top of the wall.</p>
<p>“G-Guardian….”</p>
<p>“Mighty Guardian!”</p>
<p>“He’s the Guardian of Vladivostok!”</p>
<p>The humans, who felt Orden’s gaze, began yelling. Slightly embarrassed, Orden looked away.</p>
<p>“Guardian God—!”</p>
<p>“What an honor! We praise you!”</p>
<p>Fervent cheering continued. Surprised at the fact that he was pleased, Orden stood beside Kurukuru. Then the monsters headed back to their dwelling place.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Essence of the Strait Underground Facility]</p>
<p>Dressed in the [Black Lotus Uniform], I arrived at the underground facility where [Dimensional Entropy] was stored. Upon arrival, I heard Yoo Yeonha say “I found a way to reverse the current situation.”</p>
<p>I decided to hide for the time being and listen to their conversation.</p>
<p>"We need to transmit as much energy as possible to the Tower of Wish. Is there a way?"</p>
<p>"…I'm skeptical. Dimensional Entropy is powerful, but it's also intractable. Even now, we’re barely keeping it under control with the help of the state-of-the-art stabilizers. It’s too risky to release this kind of energy in bulk.”</p>
<p>Each of the researchers expressed their ideas.</p>
<p>The nine researchers gathered here were probably the brightest people on this planet, smart enough to manage the Entropy.</p>
<p>“Can’t you find a way? We should be able to pull it off at least once if we raise the output level to the max.”</p>
<p>“What if the machine gets broken in the process? The whole planet could be destroyed…”</p>
<p>I approached them in the middle of a heated debate.</p>
<p>“Oi.”</p>
<p>“Uaaaak!”</p>
<p>The moment I spoke, the researchers screamed at the top of their lungs. I could see their hair stand on end. Even Yoo Yeonha seemed surprised, swallowing her saliva.</p>
<p>With a smile, I announced, “Don’t worry about the stability. I’ll help you out.”</p>
<p>I had multiple Gifts that could be used to increase the output of a machine: [Stigma], [Random Consolidation System], and [Constraints and Amplifications].</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“W-who is this guy? I-identify yourself!”</p>
<p>“How did you get here?!”</p>
<p>The researchers clung to each other and, as one giant ball, pointed their fingers at me. The way the middle-aged researchers screamed in panic was surprisingly cute.</p>
<p>“C-Chief Officer! Please do something! W-w-who is this man?”</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha glanced over my clothes and sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. He’s on our side.”</p>
<p>“…Our side?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sure you all have heard of him. This is Black Lotus.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Black Lotus.</p>
<p>The moment Yoo Yeonha announced my name, the researchers froze. Their lips and fingers, which had been moving non-stop until a moment ago, also stopped.</p>
<p>In absolute silence, Yoo Yeonha spoke again.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I told you, he’s our ally.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Despite her encouragement, the researchers were still skeptical. Left with no choice, I stepped forward.</p>
<p>“The plan will proceed as discussed. I can take care of the stability issue.”</p>
<p>Saying so, I approached the celestial-shaped machine. And I reached out to the heart of the machine, where [Dimensional Entropy] was placed.</p>
<p>“U-um, be, be careful.”</p>
<p>The researchers remarked worriedly. I gave a small smile and activated [Random Consolidation System].</p>
<p><em>Wiing—</em></p>
<p>The machine immediately began emitting a loud sound, and suddenly the number 48 appeared at its center.</p>
<p>48%. Truly a tremendous amplification.</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to the researchers again. Their jaws dropped from surprise. These people were experts in their fields of expertise. They must have realized that the machine was completely different from the way it used to be.</p>
<p>“…Now, let’s connect Crevon and Earth with this,” I said and glanced at Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded and came to me.</p>
<p>“Should I activate it now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Come on, everyone! We don’t have a lot of time!”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s clapping helped the researchers come to their senses. They quickly headed to the control room and began typing on the computer.</p>
<p>About 2 minutes later.</p>
<p><em>Woooong….</em></p>
<p>The celestial machine started to vibrate. The energy extracted from [Dimensional Entropy] was concentrated on one specific point.</p>
<p>*Guoooo….</p>
<p>The resonance of the vibration shook my skull.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>I felt an artificial vibration above my head. At the same time, my intuition detected footsteps full of hostility. Black water began dripping down from the ceiling.</p>
<p>“It’s the enemy.” I said to Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Right. Monsters must’ve sensed the entropy,” guessed Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>She quickly grabbed her whip. Keeping my composure, I turned to Spartan.</p>
<p>—Pururu.</p>
<p>Spartan knew what I wanted to say just from the look in my eyes. He quickly disappeared somewhere.</p>
<p><em>Kuaaaaa— Guaaaaa—</em></p>
<p>Humans are down below—! Kill the humans—! Curse the mortals—!</p>
<p>The howls of monsters mingled with the sound of the celestial machine and filled the building.</p>
<p>But there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><em>Jiiing—</em></p>
<p>About 10 seconds after Spartan's departure, a blue portal appeared right next to where I stood.</p>
<p>“Did you call for reinforcements?”</p>
<p>Having noticed the portal, Yoo Yeonha pouted, slightly discontented.</p>
<p>I smiled at her.</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>At that moment, blocks of shadows in different colors rose from the portal. They soon came into their original form.</p>
<p>“Let me introduce ourselves.”</p>
<p>They were not one but many; at the same time, many were one.</p>
<p>The reason for that was— if you combine them all, you ultimately end up with black.</p>
<p>“We are the Chameleon Troupe.”</p>
<p>Seat of Yellow, Jain.</p>
<p>Seat of Blue, Khalifa.</p>
<p>Seat of Green, Jin Yohan.</p>
<p>Seat of Violet, Droon.</p>
<p>Seat of Indigo, Yoo Kyunghwan.</p>
<p>Seat of Silver, Kaita.</p>
<p>Seat of Turquoise, Setryn.</p>
<p>Seat of Brown, Hirano Arashi.</p>
<p>And… Seat of White, Boss.</p>
<p>All the Colors of the Chameleon Troupe, except for Cheok Jungyeong, were here.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 350. Pieces (2)</p>
<p>Prihi incarcerated Puharen overnight and killed the princesses and princes who killed her mother. She executed most of their servants and knights or sent them to exile. The reformation she prepared for a long time was carried out swiftly and cruelly.</p>
<p>When the storm-like day passed, Eren was left alone. The knights who taught him swordsmanship were gone as they had supported Puharen without abandoning him.</p>
<p>However, Eren was different. Because he swore an oath to serve Prihi, he couldn’t be with Puharen. In other words, he had become a traitor.</p>
<p>Of course, he had excuses to tell himself. He was young, an orphan who didn’t know the way of the world, and he wanted to save his master. The knights he read about in fairytales had no experience in war, and most importantly, he never thought a young princess like Prihi would be capable of such cruelty.</p>
<p>Eren spent the first night tormented by worries and guilt.</p>
<p>But on the next day, he was visited by Prihi.</p>
<p>Prihi tapped on his shoulder and spoke, “This kingdom is now mine, so practice your sword without worry….”</p>
<p>Eren had already become Prihi’s knight.</p>
<p>That was the start of Eren’s troubles. After acquiring the crown, Prihi held a swordsmanship tournament to encourage her knights, and Eren participated in it and became the winner. Prihi’s most loyal servant, Kindspring, praised him greatly for this result and even rewarded him with a luxury set of armor and sword.</p>
<p>Eren wanted to tell his master about his achievements. However, when he returned to his master, he witnessed something unexpected. He found his master dead with a dagger sticking out of his chest. Clearly, he had been murdered.</p>
<p>The dagger was inscribed with Puharen’s insignia. Puharen’s supporters had punished Eren for his betrayal.</p>
<p>Eren fell to his knees. His legs went numb, and sorrow crept up from the bottom of his heart. Eren embraced his master’s body and cried until he fell asleep from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Prihi watched this scene from the distance.</p>
<p>—Heroes all over the world are fighting Djinns and devils. They need your support-!</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk opened her eyes as an anchorwoman’s voice rang out from the TV. A severe headache stunned her as memories of her past continuously emerged. She pressed her temples and let out a sigh.</p>
<p>“…What a shitty dream.”</p>
<p>She was seeing Prihi’s memories. It was the story of Akatrina and Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shook her head and raised her body. Then, the anchorwoman’s voice rang out again.</p>
<p>—We have an update! Chae Joochul and Heynckes are supposedly fighting the rank 1 devil, Baal….</p>
<p>She turned her head towards the source of the sound and saw a TV.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>It was then that Jin Sahyuk realized what situation she was in. She was lying on the asphalt in the middle of an empty, abandoned street.</p>
<p>“Tsk….”</p>
<p>‘Something big must have happened…’ Jin Sahyuk clicked her tongue. <em>Kwang—!</em> The moment she stood up, she turned her attention to the thunderous noises ringing out in the distance.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>She froze in surprise.</p>
<p>In front of her eyes was Morax, the giant devil that had destroyed Akatrina.</p>
<p>It was the devil wearing the mask of Puharen. With its huge hands and feet, it was stomping on the world once again.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korean Border]</p>
<p>Baal stared at Kim Suho, who was charging towards him. The youth’s eyes were unshaking, and a golden sword shone in his hand. Baal recognized him. He was a special existence even in Bell’s memories.</p>
<p>The man beloved by the world, the so-called ‘main character’.</p>
<p>Baal reached out towards Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Uuk!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was forced to stop. Baal’s Authority constrained his movements. Kim Suho was bound by pressure no ordinary human could withstand.</p>
<p>“Keuk….”</p>
<p>Even the ‘main character’ couldn’t do anything about it. Kim Suho unleashed his magic power and twisted his body, but he couldn’t free himself from the invisible shackles that bound him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Baal laughed as he watched Kim Suho squirm like a worm.</p>
<p>“Everything will be torn to shreds-!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Aileen’s Spirit Speech rang out. Baal turned his gaze to the tiny woman.</p>
<p>“Die-! Die-!”</p>
<p>Aileen’s Spirit Speech was directed at the large group of demons on the ground, not Baal. It wasn’t just Aileen either. Other famous Heroes were fighting the demons with all their effort.</p>
<p>Wolf of Valhalla Yoo Sihyuk, Immortal Chae Joochul, Steel Spirit Heynckes, Blitzkrieg Yoo Jinwoong, Conqueror Shin Jonghak, Hellfire Yi Yongha, Elementalist Rachel…</p>
<p>Baal recognized them all. Thanks to Bell’s memories, he knew everything about these ‘characters’.</p>
<p>Baal found the entire thing funny. He looked at their futile struggles condescendingly, but he also found them pitiful.</p>
<p>Knowing that his feelings and the Heroes’ wills were all made-up, Baal felt anger boiling up inside him.</p>
<p>Baal clenched his fists. It was then.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa-!</em></p>
<p>A huge sword of magic power shot up to the sky, almost reaching Baal’s feet. The sword couldn’t cut Baal, but it succeeded in cutting the hem of his clothes.</p>
<p>Baal furrowed his brows and looked down.</p>
<p>“Get down from there, you bastard!”</p>
<p>A girl was waving her fist around angrily. He instantly recognized her as Chae Nayun. Seeing her, a chuckle escaped his mouth.</p>
<p>Baal tried to constrain Chae Nayun, just like he did with Kim Suho. However…</p>
<p><em>Tzzzt—</em></p>
<p>A fierce frictional sound rang out as two magic powers clashed with each other. Sparks crackled into the air before a clear sword strike cut across Baal’s chest.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>A pang of pain rose up to Baal’s head. Baal looked down at his chest, now bloodied, then turned to the direction the sword strike came from.</p>
<p>There, he saw Kim Suho aiming his sword at him. He had escaped Baal’s shackles before he noticed. Misteltein was glowing gold. By the looks of it, Kim Suho had cut Baal’s Authority with only his sword.</p>
<p>“…How?”</p>
<p>Baal became curious. But he soon arrived at his answer. In truth, he didn’t even need to think. It was too obvious. Baal knew Kim Suho was the main character and that he himself was just a ‘final villain’ to be defeated by him.</p>
<p>Baal was filled with rage again. Everything happening at this moment and the next… he couldn’t help but wonder if everything was just following a script.</p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>Baal roared and drew another pentagram in the air.</p>
<p>As the second pentagram formed itself, more and more demons appeared. A large army thus descended from the Demon Realm.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Essence of the Strait, Underground Bunker]</p>
<p>Members of the Chameleon Troupe gathered in an instant. Looking at them, I shrugged somewhat proudly. I spent many years of my life with them, but this was the first time I called them all personally.</p>
<p>“Where are we?”</p>
<p>Kaita and Yoo Kyunghwan looked around the bunker curiously.</p>
<p>“Ah~ That must be that Dimensional Entropy~”</p>
<p>“Looks like it.”</p>
<p>Jain and Setryn walked towards the [Dimensional Entropy]. The Chameleon Troupe’s sole magician, Hirano Arashi, showed interest in it as well.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>On the other hand, I kept my eyes on Boss. I met her eyes, hidden deep underneath her hoodie, and asked, “Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Boss nodded silently and glanced at Yoo Yeonha who was standing by me. She looked somewhat bothered. Yoo Yeonha must have felt it too as she let out a dry cough.</p>
<p>“Kuhum, hello, I’m Yoo Yeonha.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha introduced herself. Boss looked back and forth between Yoo Yeonha and me. But we didn’t really have time to waste. The black water droplets that had been falling from the ceiling bubbled up and came together to form a figure.</p>
<p>—Crayoghoak-!</p>
<p>A 5-meter-tall human-like thing appeared. Its body was muscular, but its face was oval with only eyes and a mouth. It opened its mouth and roared.</p>
<p>—Craaaaaa-!</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe eyed the creature curiously. It let out another roar, its black teeth glistening.</p>
<p>I smirked and murmured.</p>
<p>“It must be some kind of a liquid monster.”</p>
<p>At the same time, I checked what it was using [Observation and Reading].</p>
<p>[Rank 72 Devil – Andromalius]</p>
<p>My smile disappeared immediately. Rank 72. Although it was ranked last among the 72 devils, it was still a devil nonetheless.</p>
<p>“I guess so~ This guy’s teeth are kinda pretty, don’t you think~? Almost like obsidian. I can have them, right~? Can you make me a necklace with them~?”</p>
<p>Jain took out a dagger with a grin. Setryn also hopped in.</p>
<p>“Give me half. I want one too.”</p>
<p>—Drgonak Kazhack-!</p>
<p>The liquid monster shouted again.</p>
<p>“I’ll make whatever you want. Just make sure to capture it for me.”</p>
<p>“Okay~”</p>
<p>I left it to the Chameleon Troupe and used [Constraints and Amplications] on the Dimensional Entropy.</p>
<p>*Koooong—!”</p>
<p>The second amplification made the celestial bodies shake.</p>
<p>—Craaaaa-!</p>
<p>At that moment, the liquid monster charged forward. However, Boss and Jin Yohan quickly stepped forward and stopped it. While they tied it down, Jain and Setryn’s daggers flew out.</p>
<p>[Dimensional Entropy] activated amidst this chaos.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korean Borders]</p>
<p>“…Oi, Chae Joochul.”</p>
<p>Heynckes spoke from behind Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul focused on circulating his magic power without looking back. Morax was still alive and kicking, quite literally as it stomped from one corner of the Korean peninsula to another.</p>
<p>“Joochul, that’s enough.”</p>
<p>Heynckes smiled bitterly and looked up at the sky burning with a dark red hue.</p>
<p>‘That’s enough.’ These two words could be interpreted in two ways. One was that they performed well. The other was that they could no longer stop Morax’s advance.</p>
<p>Over 30,000 Heroes had participated in this sudden battle, and its end was now clear.</p>
<p>Heynckes had lost and so had Chae Joochul. They stood a chance when Baal and Morax first descended. But when Baal’s second summoning completed, everything changed. The tide of battle turned, and they weren’t in a place where they could freely fight.</p>
<p>—Uaaak!</p>
<p>—Kuaaa!</p>
<p>A massacre was breaking out around them. The Heroes couldn’t withstand the onslaught of Baal’s army. Overwhelmed in sheer number and strength, the Heroes couldn’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>“I’ll buy as much time as I can.”</p>
<p>Heynckes raised his sword and walked forward. Chae Joochul finally took a look at Heynckes, who was imbuing his steel armor with more magic power.</p>
<p>“You deal with the army however you can. At the very least, you have to save your granddaughter.”</p>
<p>—Kuaaak!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, screams of Heroes continued to break out. Fresh blood dyed the ground red, and severed limbs lay everywhere like rocks.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul gave Heynckes a solemn look.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a matter that can be resolved just by us retreating.”</p>
<p>Heynckes shook his head in response, “But that doesn’t mean we can all die. If we retreat, a time will come when we can fight back.”</p>
<p><em>Click—</em> A metallic ringing resounded, and Heynckes equipped a helmet. It was part of the Steel Armor Heynckes was so proud of. Looking at this, Chae Joochul muttered quietly.</p>
<p>“…Are you not worried about the side-effects?”</p>
<p>Heynckes smirked from hearing Chae Joochul’s show of worry. He then gathered up his magic power.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul furrowed his brows. He could tell Heynckes was using every bit of his remaining lifeforce in this moment’s ‘Steel Spirit’.</p>
<p>“I’ll take care of my matters myself. You retreat with the warriors who are still alive…?”</p>
<p>At that moment, a strange, mystifying happening occurred.</p>
<p><em>Jiiing—!</em></p>
<p>A beam of light shot up from the ground. Soon, even more beams shot up.</p>
<p><em>Shooooo….</em></p>
<p>The brilliant lights broke through the battlefield and traveled upwards into the sky.</p>
<p>“What’s….”</p>
<p>Both the demons and the Heroes paused momentarily, curious about the unknown light.</p>
<p>For a split moment, everyone was staring at the beams of light. And a few seconds later, something else appeared from within the light.</p>
<p><em>Guooo….</em></p>
<p>The sound of an engine erupted from the sky. A huge shadow was cast over one end of the battlefield to the other. The shadow soon covered the entire wilderness where the battle was taking place, and the Heroes all tilted their heads upwards.</p>
<p>—This is Genkelope. We have arrived on the orders of the Ship Commander. We will now commence supporting fire.</p>
<p>[Genkelope Vessel], a spacecraft created by science several levels above that of Earth, appeared through the clouds.</p>

<p>Chapter 351. Pieces (3)</p>
<p>[Paris, France]</p>
<p>Astaroth’s barrier around Madrid had been lifted. As many had feared, Astaroth, who came out of the barrier, brought with him a powerful army. The devil reached Paris in no time.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In traveled to Paris to stop Astaroth. But by the time she arrived, Paris was already in ruins.</p>
<p>Astaroth and his army were trampling on the city and slaughtering humans. The screams of innocent victims rang out endlessly, and the Heroes were helpless against the devil’s attack.</p>
<p>Looking at the ruins of her old hometown, Ah Hae-In bit her lip. She felt something hot boiling up in her heart. The scene of the brutal killing filled her with anger. ‘I'm glad I didn't bring Evandel with me,’ she thought.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p><em>Hiiing—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly the unicorn cried out. The unicorn, who had brought Ah Hae-In here at Evandel’s command, shuddered at the horrendous state of Paris. Evandel had ignored her master’s warning and shared vision with the unicorn.</p>
<p>“Evandel!” Ah Hae-In shouted.</p>
<p>The unicorn, trembling, sank to the ground. Evandel had cut off her connection to the unicorn.</p>
<p>“….Damn it.”</p>
<p>Evandel’s spirit beasts, having noticed their master’s agitation, suddenly lost control of themselves. They threw themselves at the devil's army. Everyone turned their attention to Ah Hae-In, and she had no choice but to call upon her summoned beasts.</p>
<p>The Azure Dragon and the Black Turtle, two of Ah Hae-In’s most adored summoned beasts, responded to her call.</p>
<p>—I-it’s Duchess Ah Hae-In!</p>
<p>—The reinforcements are here-!</p>
<p>The Azure Dragon occupied the sky while the Black Turtle occupied the earth. Having noticed the arrival of the Cardinal Beasts, the Heroes of France cheered for Ah Hae-In.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of an all-out war between tamed beasts and the devil.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>The spirit beasts and demons clashed violently. There were explosions everywhere, and the cries of spirit beasts and the screams of demons mingled.</p>
<p>The situation wasn’t exactly in favor of humans as the spirit beasts lost their chain of command and went berserk.</p>
<p>“Evandel!”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In sent Evandel a Mental Transmission. But there was no reply. The cruel war with endless deaths was still too early for the young girl.</p>
<p>Evandel’s spirit beasts also noticed their master’s agitation. Some of them thought she was in danger and left the battlefield altogether.</p>
<p>“Evandel! Hang in there, Evandel!” Ah Hae-In shouted.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>Suddenly the flow of air stretched and sound slowed down. Ah Hae-In was now able to feel the movement of the air and particles in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was a strange sensation.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In stopped and looked around. The world had slowed down just as her senses did. The spirit beasts were frozen in place with their claws pointed forward and the rays of demonic energy remained frozen in the air without advancing further.</p>
<p>“It seems this has become quite a bit of trouble.”</p>
<p>And then, a small voice flowed into Ah Hae-In’s ears. Startled, she turned.</p>
<p>“…Ah?”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In widened her eyes. An old man was there. His thick gray hair and deep eyes were memorable.</p>
<p>“You’re….”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In knew who he was. Not only was she familiar with his appearance, but she had also felt his magic power before. There was no way she could ever forget such a pure and marvelous power.</p>
<p>This old man was Oh Jaejin, the world’s first and last 10-star grand magician, and a member of the Nine Stars.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin gave a small smile. Ah Hae-In couldn’t say a thing. She first met him 20 years ago at a Magic Tower. At the time, Oh Jaejin was the head of Seoul Magic Power, and she was just a beginner who couldn’t control even the simplest of magic.</p>
<p>But one day Oh Jaejin left the tower. Even then the grand magician had been well-known for his peculiar character. Everyone thought he would return soon, but he never did. The first and last grand magician soon disappeared from the world of magic.</p>
<p>“…Grand Magician Oh Jaejin-nim?”</p>
<p>That’s why Ah Hae-In couldn’t believe her eyes. Despite the many shocking rumors—that he was suffering from dementia or that he had been castrated—Oh Jaejin had not appeared in public in years.</p>
<p>But now, here he was, in front of the devil’s army.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s good to see you, Ah Hae-In.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Ah, of course. But, um. H-how did you get here? N-no, more than that, what have you been d-doing u-u-until now…?”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In couldn’t even speak properly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the grand magician replied with a smile.</p>
<p>“A few months ago, there was a young man who came to see me. He told me he needed my help.”</p>
<p>Though his dementia healed thanks to the medicine he received from Kim Hajin, it took him a long time to reclaim his sense of magic lost over the years. Also, he had a difficult time persuading his wife, who always worried too much.</p>
<p>“I was hiding because I needed a little time… but that’s all in the past now. Move over, I’ll deal with him.”</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin plodded past her. Ah Hae-In turned and looked at his back. It was just an old man’s back but it felt as big as a tower to her.</p>
<p>The old man held a long tree branch like a cane and shook it very lightly.</p>
<p>And the world stopped. This was not hyperbole. Everything except Ah Hae-In and Oh Jaejin ceased to move. This mesmerized Ah Hae-In.</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but admire such an astonishing skill. Oh Jaejin, the great 10-star grand magician, had defied the logic of man and nature and reached a miracle.</p>
<p>He could control exerted time— in other words, all the movements of the world.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Essence of the Strait Underground Facility]</p>
<p>As soon as I activated [Dimensional Entropy], I also activated [Buster Call]. My Stigma hadn’t been restored completely yet, but I was able to summon Genkelope’s Vessel using Overclocking.</p>
<p>“Are you done~?” Jain asked. I nodded and turned my gaze to her.</p>
<p>Andromalius, the rank 72 devil. Though he was ranked last, he was still a devil. However, right now, he was….</p>
<p><em>Crunch—! Crunch—!</em></p>
<p>…Being eaten alive by Droon’s Mimyo.</p>
<p>“Don’t overdo it, Mimyo. You might get a stomachache later.”</p>
<p>Droon patted Mimyo, and Mimyo wiggled his ears.</p>
<p>That whole scene was pretty mind-boggling. I gave a bitter smile and began speaking to Horner.</p>
<p>“Horner, are you there?”</p>
<p>—Yes, sir. Everyone is on standby.</p>
<p>His voice never failed to ease my mind. Moreover, when I checked the vessel with the Thousand-Mile Eyes, I could see that the whole ship, not just Horner, had been upgraded greatly.</p>
<p>“How are things down there?”</p>
<p>—According to the supercomputer, not so good. We’ve detected two powerful devils.</p>
<p>It had only been about 10 seconds since I summoned the ship, but the supercomputer had already completed all the calculations.</p>
<p>Trying to conceal my surprise, I answered, “Got it. We’ll be there.”</p>
<p>—I’ll open the portal.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a portal sprang up right in front of me. This technology had never failed to amaze me.</p>
<p>—Come in. Your guest is waiting for you.</p>
<p>“My guest? What guest… ah.”</p>
<p>I had a rough idea of who it was. I had just activated the [Dimensional Entropy], so the timing was right, too.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll head over right now. You guys, protect this place,” I told the members of the Chameleon Troupe, who were preparing to follow me.</p>
<p>At present, the [Dimensional Entropy] was more important than anything else in the world. So I needed to leave it in the hands of trustworthy people.</p>
<p>“Why should you have all the fun…. Ehew. Fine~”</p>
<p>Jain pouted at first but nodded when she felt Boss glare at her.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave it to you. Yoo Yeonha, follow me.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Ah… okay.”</p>
<p>I entered the portal and Yoo Yeonha followed me while glancing at Boss.</p>
<p>[Genkelope’s Vessel]</p>
<p>As soon as I entered the portal, I saw the letters ‘Genkelope’s Vessel’ engraved on the ceiling of the ship.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, sir.”</p>
<p>Horner greeted us with a welcoming smile.</p>
<p>“Long time no see. Ah, this is Yoo Yeonha.”</p>
<p>I introduced Yoo Yeonha to Horner. She shook hands with Horner and looked around the ship.</p>
<p>“Let’s get moving now. We don’t have much time.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Please follow me, Ship Commander.”</p>
<p>I followed Horner to the control room. From there we could freely observe the battlefield below.</p>
<p>“Many Heroes are fighting there right now.”</p>
<p>Horner pointed to where Baal and Morax had been summoned. The situation didn’t look good even at a glance. It was more of a one-sided slaughter than a war. The number of monsters and demons hadn’t changed at all, while the number of Heroes was decreasing at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>“They don’t really care about us, do they? Even though this ship is huge.” I asked curiously.</p>
<p>Horner answered. “We’re currently in Stealth Mode, so the enemy can’t see us.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We’ve been waiting for your order. Should we proceed?”</p>
<p>Horner looked down at the demons, his expression sour. He was clearly burning with anger, perhaps because his hometown in the Tower of Wish had been captured by demons as well.</p>
<p>“…Yes, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Genkelope’s soldiers, get ready.”</p>
<p>As soon as I gave my permission, Horner solemnly ordered the soldiers to sortie. Immediately the ship lifted its Stealth Mode, revealed its steel body and opened its hangar.</p>
<p><em>Shooong… Kwaaaaaa-!</em></p>
<p>Hundreds of fighter jets were dispatched from the hangar.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“So this is where you were, Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>Someone called my name and stood beside me. I knew who it was without even looking.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“You betcha. I mean— long time no see. My name is Tomer, from the Empire.”</p>
<p>It was Tomer. Much stronger than the last time we met, she was wearing a luxurious and powerful-looking armor and cape.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Near the Korean border]</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak looked up in a daze. A pillar of light rose from the ground, and a huge warship appeared in the sky and began bombing the demons.</p>
<p>Not only Shin Jonghak but also many of the Heroes gathered failed to understand the current situation.</p>
<p>“Oi.”</p>
<p>A woman approached Shin Jonghak, who was still dazed by the scene. Shin Jonghak flinched and swung his spear towards the woman, but she easily blocked the Conqueror Spear.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak glared at her and asked. “…Why?”</p>
<p>“Why, what?”</p>
<p>The woman, Jin Sahyuk, gave an inscrutable smile.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak frowned.</p>
<p>“What I meant to say was, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Ah~ Well, it’s nothing serious.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk scratched her cheek awkwardly.</p>
<p>The truth was that Jin Sahyuk wanted to run away. She wanted to escape from the nightmare that was Morax. Using the Dimensional Stone in her possession, she could easily return to Akatrina.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was never an option. Morax would never give up on her. She knew that if she didn’t take care of him here and now, he would follow her all the way to Akatrina.</p>
<p>And so, Jin Sahyuk went to Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“Well. Do you remember Bell saying that Shin Myungchul left you something very important?”</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul was the first clue to breaking Baal and Morax.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak showed interest in the name.</p>
<p>“Yeah, he did say that. What about it?”</p>
<p>“Ah~ Nothing, just that I remembered something important.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak grabbed the Conqueror Spear. Jin Sahyuk hadn’t said a word yet, but he knew she was going to insult Shin Myungchul. ‘I’ll kill her before she does,’ he decided.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk, however, put her hand on his shoulder without saying a word. Shin Jonghak looked down at her hand with a frown, then turned the scowl on her.</p>
<p>Catching his eye, Jin Sahyuk announced, “I think I figured out what Shin Myungchul left you.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had a dream today about Eren and Prihi. Memories of those days in Akatrina remained in her heart as regret, and Morax was the physical manifestation of the said regret.</p>
<p>It was most certainly a tormenting trauma.</p>
<p>But thanks to that excruciating experience, Jin Sahyuk realized just what ‘Shin Myungchul’s legacy’ that Bell mentioned was and where it was hidden.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Shin Jonghak asked, suspicious.</p>
<p>“I don’t tell lies. So just shut up and follow me, loser,” Jin Sahyuk muttered and grabbed Shin Jonghak’s shoulder. And then, she activated her Authority without waiting for his answer.</p>
<p>At that moment, Shin Jonghak felt as if he was being sucked into something.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth, but no sound came out. He felt nauseous, but no vomit would come out.</p>
<p>About 30 seconds passed in that uncomfortable state.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“…What, haa, haa. What the hell?”</p>
<p>He looked around, panting. He was surrounded in black. Nothing was here but Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“Dammit. Oi! Where the hell am I?!”</p>
<p>“…Where do you think? We’re inside your mind.”</p>
<p>“What? What does that even… what the hell are you talking about?”</p>
<p>It seemed that in place of confusion, anger was about to take control of Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Leaving him to vent alone, Jin Sahyuk looked around the dark.</p>
<p>“If my guess is right, then you’ll meet that Shin Myungchul guy who you seem to love so much.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 352. Pieces (4)</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak stared at Jin Sahyuk in silence. Her words suggesting that he could meet Shin Myungchul captivated him more than anything.</p>
<p>But of course, it was hard to believe such a thing was possible.</p>
<p>“We’re inside my mind, you said?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak asked the most basic question first. Currently, he was surrounded by darkness. Though Jin Sahyuk had claimed this space to be his mind, Shin Jonghak simply couldn’t accept her answer.</p>
<p>Despite his doubt, Jin Sahyuk nodded without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ve recreated your mind to my liking.”</p>
<p>It was one of the many applications of Reality Manipulation. Jin Sahyuk observed Shin Jonghak’s mind and recreated it so that she could uncover Shin Myungchul’s legacy buried inside Shin Jonghak’s consciousness.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak seemed quite dissatisfied with the whole setup, however. He wasn’t too happy with the voidness of the surrounding view.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said with a smirk, “I for one think this space suits you. It’s pitch black.”</p>
<p>“…What did you say?”</p>
<p>A strand of vein popped out of Shin Jonghak’s temple. He stumbled back almost at the same time. Several objects were rising from the darkness beneath his feet.</p>
<p>“W-what are these?”</p>
<p>This took Shin Jonghak by surprise. Rising out of the swampy darkness were objects deeply related to Shin Jonghak’s ego. Kim Hajin’s sculpture of Shin Jonghak, the youngest high-rank Hero certificate, Xiang Yu’s Conqueror’s Spear, and even a statue of Chae Nayun…. But the most important of them all was the door at the rear.</p>
<p>[Shin Myungchul]</p>
<p>The iron gate was inscribed with Shin Myungchul’s name.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>While Shin Jonghak stood in awe, Jin Sahyuk began to walk towards the gate. Doubtful of her intentions, Shin Jonghak followed closely behind. He didn’t forget to cover Chae Nayun’s statue with his coat so that Jin Sahyuk wouldn’t misunderstand(?).</p>
<p>“Hmm…. Myungchul. It’s a pretty corny name, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk banged on the iron gate a couple of times and looked back at Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak said nothing; instead, he began pondering upon his own existence.</p>
<p>He knew very well the public opinion of himself as a Hero.</p>
<p>They called him the youngest high-rank Hero, the vice leader of the giant guild ‘Desolate Moon’, the heir of Jinsung Corp, and a handsome man who could beat even the most famous celebrities in looks alone. Though all these descriptions were remarkable in their own way, Shin Jonghak never forgot his roots.</p>
<p>There was no way he could ever forget.</p>
<p>In this vast world only he was allowed to take such pride in himself.</p>
<p>That is— pride as the grandson of Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>“…Are you saying my grandfather’s behind that door?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak asked. He had so many questions left.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk gave a candid nod.</p>
<p>“Yes, probably. My guess is that Shin Myungchul sealed a part of his soul in the deepest corner of your consciousness. Just like I did.”</p>
<p>Until recently, Jin Sahyuk’s memories of Akatrina had been sealed inside her. She did that because she didn’t think she could face her current life properly with the burdens of her past life in her heart. Thankfully, this experience served as a clue to her.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk suspected Shin Myungchul had used a similar method. Bell said that Shin Myungchul left Shin Jonghak a legacy. ‘Perhaps,’ she thought, ‘Shin Myungchul used the same method as I did, just in a completely different way.’</p>
<p>“…It’s not that I trust you completely, but-”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak gulped. He gave Jin Sahyuk a doubtful look and brought his hands to the gate. And then, he tried to push open the gate. But it wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>A groan escaped Shin Jonghak’s lips. Still, his efforts seemed futile.</p>
<p>“Try using your magic power.” Jin Sahyuk interrupted.</p>
<p>Shing Jonghak leered at her, then poured his magic power into the gate. The gate responded to the magic power and finally began to move.</p>
<p><em>Oooong…</em></p>
<p>The iron gate vibrated as it answered to Shin Jonghak’s magic power. Soon it opened smoothly like a clam opening its mouth.</p>
<p><em>Kiik— Koong!</em></p>
<p>The heavy sound of iron rang out. Shin Jonghak looked at the other side of the gate with his feet planted on the ground. He gulped in anticipation. He could feel his heart sink as if something big and heavy had just dropped on top of it.</p>
<p>There was a man standing at the other side of the gate. Shin Jonghak could see him clearly.</p>
<p>His shoulders were as wide as a mountain and his posture was as straight as a river. His long hair covered both parts of his body. Shin Jonghak felt a shiver down his spine. The mere sight of the man had completely stunned him.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak gulped yet again and slowly turned his gaze to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“If this is some kind of trick….”</p>
<p>“I told you, it’s not.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk answered in a seemingly annoyed voice. Shin Jonghak glared at her one last time and crossed the threshold of the gate.</p>
<p>At that moment, something strange happened. The man began moving awkwardly, like a broken clockwork puppet. Then, he slowly raised his head.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak could see his eyes now. Their gazes met. A small, barely visible smile spread across the man’s face. At the same time, Shin Jonghak felt as if his body had been set on fire.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul, the Hero who had left Shin Jonghak an everlasting impression, was there.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Private bunker of the Chancellor of Germany]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Valac’s army devastated Eastern Europe and reached Germany. Europe was now besieged by two devils: Astaroth in the west and Valac in the east. Astaroth destroyed Paris, and Germany didn’t stand a chance against Valac. The devils took complete control of Europe as the two great calamities….</p>
<p>“We’re at our limit. Berlin can’t hold out any longer.”</p>
<p>Jenes, the Chancellor of Germany, announced pitifully. His hands trembled in fear as he sent over the footage of Berlin’s defense barrier to Yi Gongmyung.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung studied the footage carefully. As Supreme Commander, it was his duty to map out a strategy that would lead the team to victory.</p>
<p>—…It’s coming down.</p>
<p>Still, there wasn’t much that he could say. It was clear that Berlin’s defenses were being toppled by the demons’ attack.</p>
<p>The army of demons swiftly ravaged Poland and arrived at Berlin. It was only a matter of time before Berlin’s defense barrier, the product of cutting-edge magic engineering, crumbled down.</p>
<p>“Can we at least evacuate the people?” Jenes asked.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung shook his head. Both east and west had been seized by the enemies. This meant the citizens could not travel by land. But it was also impossible to evacuate billions of people through portals.</p>
<p>They had run into a dead end.</p>
<p>“What do you expect me to do, then?!” Jenes yelled. He was beginning to tear up. The guilt of not being able to save his people weighed heavily on the heart of the Chancellor.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung said with a sigh.</p>
<p>—Please try to hold out a little longer. There’s not much we can do at this point in time. Baal, Morax, and a third devil have invaded Korea. I’m afraid the situation here is not so good either. But I’m sure we’ll be able to come up with something….</p>
<p>The Chancellor clenched his teeth. Despair and disappointment replaced the rage in his heart. He ruminated on the current situation again.</p>
<p>He was currently inside an underground bunker in Korea. Germany’s commander-in-chief, along with the members of his cabinet, had abandoned their people and evacuated to a bunker in a foreign country. It was hypocritical of him to worry about the people he had left behind by choice.</p>
<p>“…I understand.”</p>
<p>Just as the Chancellor spat out words of resignation, the screen that showed Berlin suddenly turned white.</p>
<p>Jenes widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“W-what’s going on?!”</p>
<p>Jenes exclaimed in German. It didn’t take long for him to understand what had just happened.</p>
<p>The end had come.</p>
<p>Demons had succeeded in destroying Germany.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jenes closed his eyes and clenched his fists. The cabinet ministers inside the bunker reacted similarly.</p>
<p>Slowly, the whiteness of the screen began to fade away. The blinding light disappeared and Berlin revealed itself again. But the revealed scenery was markedly different from the previous one.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they heard a strange voice coming out of the speaker.</p>
<p>—The time has come for us to strike.</p>
<p>Jenes’s jaw dropped in awe.</p>
<p>—The time has come to recover our homeland from the darkness and reveal our bravery.</p>
<p>The voice resounded gravely. At the same time, a group of soldiers in uniform appeared in fields beyond the barrier. To the people in the bunker, the appearance of these soldiers seemed even more unrealistic than the demons occupying Germany.</p>
<p>—We shall therefore advance and slay evil without hesitation.</p>
<p>The scene unfolding before their eyes was far beyond their understanding.</p>
<p>“…Commander?”</p>
<p>Jenes called Yi Gongmyung with his gaze locked onto the screen. But no reply came from the supreme commander. He was in no state to answer the Chancellor.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung was looking at a different screen. Germany was not the only country he had been observing. The soldiers who arrived in Germany were only a fraction of the total.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, rays of light descended from the sky. Through the passage of light came reinforcements from another dimension. Bearing unimaginable strength, these soldiers came from Crevon to fulfill their promise to Earth.</p>
<p>Jenes recognized the man at the front.</p>
<p>“C-Commander! Ki Parang, Ki Parang is here!”</p>
<p>Jenes pointed at the man at the front of the army. The man was indeed Ki Parang. Even Jenes had heard of him before. A celebrity inside the Tower was also a celebrity outside.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung finally responded to Jenes’s call. He widened his eyes slightly and looked at the soldiers on the screen.</p>
<p>—…Yes, I see him.</p>
<p>“What does this mean?”</p>
<p>Jenes asked urgently. But Yi Gongmyung remained silent, and the soldiers started to advance. Ki Parang’s sword spewed out a wave of magic power. The crowd cheered when they saw that the wave devoured the demons as a whole.</p>
<p>—Ki Parang, Kim Yusin, Gwanchang…. Most of them are Hwarangs from Crevon. I’m having trouble grasping the situation myself, but it seems that luck is on our side. Chancellor, please assist them as much as you can.</p>
<p>Yi Gongmyung announced gravely. Jenes turned his gaze to the battlefield. The commander of the army made up of Hwarangs, who he guessed to be Kim Yusin, swung his sword. The Qi from the sword formed thousands of human figures.</p>
<p>The soldiers, made up of magic power, formed an army of their own. They moved at the command of their master, Kim Yusin. The soldiers protected the German Heroes and began attacking the demons.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Looking at the screen, the Chancellor clenched his fists. The arrival of reinforcements had turned the tables as Crevon’s Hwarangs overpowered the demons in all aspects.</p>
<p>The Chancellor ordered his men to assist the Hwarangs as much as possible.</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope was beginning to bloom in the hearts of people all over the world.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Genkelope’s Vessel]</p>
<p>I postponed my meeting with Tomer because the situation was bad. She and I headed to the ship's control room. A huge holographic screen which occupied one side of the wall showed the Heroes of Crevon, who had returned to Earth.</p>
<p>Tomer snapped her fingers and announced proudly. "In China, we have Lü Bu and Zhang Liao. In Japan, we have Musashi. Kim Yusin and Ki Parang are in Germany, and Lancelot is in the U.S…. Add in my soldiers and the Imperial Army, and the total is about 200,000 soldiers."</p>
<p>“…That many?”</p>
<p>This took me by surprise. I only did a rough job of portraying these historical figures in the original novel, and never thought they would actually appear.</p>
<p>"Yeah, a lot of them were living in hiding in Crevon, and when I explained the situation to them, they said they'd help."</p>
<p>“Ohh….”</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to the screen. As she said, Musashi Miyamoto, Lü Bu, Lancelot and Silla’s Hwarangs were hard at work on the battlefield. In the past, all of these men lived on Earth, and after they died, their souls were revived in the Tower. And now, they were slaughtering the devils and demons to rescue their home.</p>
<p>“What do you think? Should we sit back and relax?”</p>
<p>Tomer shrugged with a relaxed look.</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>But I shook my head. This was still not enough. We still needed more strength to prepare for our final battle against Baal. I finally decided it was time to use the secret weapons I’d kept hidden.</p>
<p>“You should go help Suho for now.”</p>
<p>“Suho? Kim Suho?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And what do you plan to do in the meantime?”</p>
<p>I took a card out of my pocket and smiled. Even with my superhuman luck, I could only secure one copy.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>Tomer tilted her head.</p>
<p>I answered calmly. “It’s a 9-star card. You know, from the Card Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“…9-star?”</p>
<p>Tomer frowned as if doubting my words.</p>
<p>Apparently, cards from the Card Kingdom were famous even in Crevon. A direct trade route had been established after they gained control of the 9th floor.</p>
<p>“How is that even possible? The most our Empress could get were two 8-star cards.”</p>
<p>To resolve Tomer’s doubts, I showed her the 9-star card. Her eyes widened immediately.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Story of a Legend on the Mural] [Individual] [9-star] <em>Effective Good</em></p>
<p>●Part of a legend manifests to assist you.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…Woah. Is that for real? Hey, come on, hand it over. Let me take a look.”</p>
<p>“No way.”</p>
<p>Tomer reached out to the card but I had no intention of handing it over to her. I hid the card away from her.</p>
<p>“Oh come on! Just let me take a peek at it….”</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p>I held the card with my fingers and injected Stigma into it.</p>
<p>“Let’s see what we’ll get.”</p>
<p>The card, now infused with my magic power, began to tremble. I let go of it, and the card that escaped my hand slowly rose into the air. Then suddenly— <em>Paat!</em> It flashed and disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds passed, and….</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>“…What the hell?”</p>
<p>Bewildered, Tomer and I looked at each other. I blinked in confusion, but Tomer soon began wiggling her eyebrows as if she was proud of herself to have figured out my trick.</p>
<p>“Aha~ I see what’s going on. That card was fake, right?”</p>
<p>“…No, It wasn’t.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 353. Final Name (1)</p>
<p>Under the dark sky, the waves of blood covered the earth. Piles of corpses formed mountains, and intestines rolled about like stones on the ground. Even at the scene of one of the most horrendous massacres in human history, the murderer, Baal, remained calm. He seemed apathetic even, just like a human killing ants.</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAA….</em></p>
<p>Somewhere, magic power was raging. Baal turned his gaze to the source of the sound. Kim Suho’s sword strike was coming for him.</p>
<p>Baal scattered the sword strike with a single motion of his hand. But Kim Suho was persistent. He continued to wield his sword, though by now he must have realized that he, a mere human, was no match for the transcendent evil that was Baal.</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>With a shout, Kim Suho poured his all into his sword. But Baal easily parried his blow. <em>Clang—!</em> Baal’s demonic energy and Kim Suho’s sword collided with each other with a sharp clang. Then, suddenly, another sword cut through their point of contact.</p>
<p>“You— bastard—!”</p>
<p>With a loud shout, Chae Nayun swung her magic sword, which was as big as Morax.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun extended her sword, hoping it would reach Baal. In response, the devil stretched his demonic energy, and the thin string of demonic energy destroyed the core of her sword, shattering it to bits.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a smile flickered across Baal’s face. Chae Nayun’s sword, which covered half of his view, disappeared, and now he could clearly see those who had been hiding behind it.</p>
<p>Countless Heroes, each with unique weapons and powers, were racing towards Baal.</p>
<p>Baal recognized all of them. Rachel, Yoo Sihyuk, Yoo Jinwoong, Aileen, Nicholas…. As he perceived their names and faces, Baal suddenly grew tired.</p>
<p>He regretted synchronizing with Bell. If it weren’t for Bell’s memories, he wouldn’t have allowed those ants to bother him in the first place.</p>
<p>Instead of facing the Heroes, Baal slowed the time around them. In a world of stillness, Baal carefully observed each and every single one of them.</p>
<p>They were filled with determination. Clearly, nothing could break their resolve to protect their world.</p>
<p>Looking at their faces, Baal began to ponder upon the concept of a ‘novel’.</p>
<p>Was this where he was supposed to fall? If so, for what did he destroy all those different worlds? Were all his years of life just a fictional device for this moment?</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Baal looked up at the sky in silence. White specks of dust were slowly appearing in the dark sky. The specks became rays of light that poured down towards the earth in slow motion. Each of these rays represented a portal that carried reinforcements from another dimension.</p>
<p>Looking at the scenery before his eyes, Baal smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>—What is this?</p>
<p>—Has ‘god’ responded to the humans’ prayers?</p>
<p>—Then, where was this god when I was destroying other worlds?</p>
<p>This wasn’t the kind of contemplation that suited a devil.</p>
<p>Baal closed his eyes, and the speed of the world returned to normal.</p>
<p>“…Baal.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho called Baal’s name and glanced at Morax behind Baal.</p>
<p>Baal’s face was expressionless as he looked straight at Kim Suho. He had plenty of questions for the hero.</p>
<p>—Do you know where you came from?</p>
<p>—What if you were just a toy- a doll designed for the sake of entertaining ‘higher beings’? Will you still sacrifice your life just to kill me?</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Baal didn’t ask, so Kim Suho didn’t answer. The devil already knew Kim Suho’s answer, though, based on Bell’s memories.</p>
<p>—Whoever I am, whatever this world is, it doesn’t matter. I’m just protecting people who are precious to me.</p>
<p>That was what Kim Suho would say.</p>
<p>“Sir Suho. So this is where you were.”</p>
<p>Crevon’s troops lined up behind Kim Suho, who stood firm with his sword in his hand. Most of the soldiers were knights, but there were priests and magicians among them as well. Kim Suho glanced at them and nodded.</p>
<p>“…Very funny.”</p>
<p>Baal scoffed and examined the world before him.</p>
<p>Morax was in perfect shape, and he still had a lot of soldiers left.</p>
<p>Still, humans were obstinate. A huge metallic object was floating in the sky, bombarding demons, and those who couldn’t possibly exist in this world descended from the sky through the paths of light.</p>
<p>—…Old Man.</p>
<p>At that moment, letters appeared in front of Baal. He realized immediately who had sent this message - Leraje.</p>
<p>“Where are you?”</p>
<p>—I can’t help you.</p>
<p>Baal clenched his teeth.</p>
<p>“…Where are you?”</p>
<p>—It wouldn’t be a bad idea to withdraw here.</p>
<p>“Don’t make me say it again,” Baal growled, not even trying to hide his anger.</p>
<p>However, Leraje was insistent.</p>
<p>—You already lost your castle. Don’t push yourself too hard. Why don’t you just give up this time….</p>
<p>Castle. Baal’s castle served as an important medium that linked the Phenomenon Realm and the Transcendent Realm. Without his castle, Baal’s demonic energy was no longer infinite, and the number of soldiers Baal could summon decreased as well.</p>
<p>And said castle had already been destroyed by a certain foe….</p>
<p>“…Leave.”</p>
<p>Baal shook Leraje off. Bual was already dead, and Vassago and Leraje had no intention of cooperating with Baal. He realized that victory was no longer a guarantee.</p>
<p>That did not mean he intended to step down. Even if he was fated to die here, even if he was ‘created’ to eventually lose….</p>
<p>“I’ll destroy this world by myself.”</p>
<p>With a look of firm determination, Baal took a step forward. Kim Suho’s eyes and thousands of pairs of eyes lined up behind Kim Suho, turned to Baal.</p>
<p>Baal faced them straight as he altered his body. He broke out of his human form and took on the form of a devil.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Chweeek—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly arrows, spears, and swords pierced the devil’s body. More than pain, he felt perplexed. There was nothing special about these weapons, yet they had managed to cut through his demonic energy and wound his demonic flesh.</p>
<p>Baal opened his eyes wide and turned to where the attack had come from. He felt confused, almost astonished by what he saw next.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>A magician was there. Baal knew her name even without relying on Bell’s memory.</p>
<p>Shimurin, the Grand Magician.</p>
<p>“How….”</p>
<p>But Shimurin wasn’t the only one who had appeared out of the blue. The soldiers of the other world who escaped destruction had arrived on Earth through Shimurin’s magic.</p>
<p>These soldiers were aiming at Baal, each armed with exorcism weapons.</p>
<p>“Hm. This world sure is humid.”</p>
<p>Muttering, Shimruin stepped forward. Baal said nothing. He tried hard to grasp the present situation. He knew Shimurin died a long time ago…. He had never experienced anything like this in thousands of years.</p>
<p>Suddenly a voice flowed into Baal’s ears.</p>
<p>—You brought this on yourself, Baal.</p>
<p>Baal recognized this voice.</p>
<p>Vassago, the rank 2 devil.</p>
<p>She went on as if none of this surprised her at all.</p>
<p>—You’ve regenerated the first world you descended into and brought to ruin. The only way you could overcome the law of causality and descend entirely was to destroy the world once again, which had already been destroyed. But this time, the world you regenerated was not destroyed. ‘Someone’ protected that world, and now its people came to hunt you down.</p>
<p>Baal was silent. He turned his gaze to Shimurin and the other humans.</p>
<p>The Republic of Leores.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Arunheim.</p>
<p>His feelings towards the people of the other world were contradictory. He considered them insignificant, but at the same time, he also missed them.</p>
<p>The devil hunter named Harin, the knight named Airun, the magician named Shimurin.</p>
<p>And… the prince by the name of ‘Krisbell’.</p>
<p>A smile spread across Baal’s face as he locked gazes with his old friend.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Essence of the Strait Underground Bunker — Yoo Yeonha’s Office]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was sitting in an office full of hologram screens. Each of these screens was broadcasting real-time situations around the world. Everyone was fighting the same war under different skies.</p>
<p>East Asia, Oceania, America and Europe. All the continents were engulfed in war, and death and destruction spread like infectious diseases throughout the world.</p>
<p>“Focus on saving lives. There’s enough food and medicine in the bunker.”</p>
<p>—Roger.</p>
<p>With the brutality of the war still in mind, Yoo Yeonha gave orders to her people. She was well aware of her duties as the Chief Officer of Essence of the Strait.</p>
<p>“I think [Dimensional Entropy] is safe now~”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a leisurely voice rang in Yoo Yeonha’s ears. Yoo Yeonha slowly raised her head. Jain was leaning against the wall of the office.</p>
<p>“We’ve worked pretty hard. Do we get anything for it~?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha frowned. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to give rewards. What bothered her was Jain’s appearance.</p>
<p>Jain was disguised as Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“There will be plenty of rewards. You don’t have to worry about that.”</p>
<p>“What’s with the sour face~?”</p>
<p>“…It’s your disguise.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha muttered, and Jain smirked. Slowly, Jain approached Yoo Yeonha, with her disguise still on.</p>
<p>“I- I said stop. Enough with the jokes.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha blushed as Kim Hajin’s face neared hers.</p>
<p>“What do you think? It’s amazing, right? My disguise, I mean. I can even change my voice.”</p>
<p>Jain grinned and caressed Yoo Yeonha’s cheek. When the warm hand that had the same temperature as Kim Hajin reached her, Yoo Yeonha gulped.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>—Chief Officer!</p>
<p>Surprised by the voice calling her, Yoo Yeonha pushed Jain away.</p>
<p>Jain clicked her tongue, and Yoo Yeonha answered in a loud voice.</p>
<p>“W-w-what?!”</p>
<p>—Please take a look at this.</p>
<p>The informant showed Yoo Yeonha a video. It was taken at a forest near Vladivostok. Two humans- no, two humanoid monsters were in it. At first, she thought it was nothing special.</p>
<p>But then the moment she recognized the two monsters, she felt her hair stand on end.</p>
<p>“…Is this…?”</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>The informant announced gravely.</p>
<p>—It’s Orden.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Feeling a painful throb in her head, Yoo Yeonha stared at Orden. Orden was pushing his way through the grass. He clearly had a destination in mind.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis of his route, it was predicted that Orden was headed to the Korean border, where the battle with Baal was currently taking place.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Orden was coming here. Orden, who used to be humanity’s worst enemy before Baal. He was coming to finally destroy Earth for good.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha sank to the floor in despair. Her slender body slipped down the chair, and Jain smirked at the sight.</p>
<p>—But there’s something strange about them….</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha couldn’t focus on the words that followed. She thought everything was over now. She was barely holding out, and the news of Orden pushed her into a meltdown.</p>
<p>‘If I’m gonna die like this, if everything is gonna end like this… wouldn’t it be better to say what I haven’t been able to say before I’m gone for good?’</p>
<p>With that in mind, Yoo Yeonha picked up her smartwatch instead of planting an apple tree.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 354. The Final Name (2)</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak looked at Shin Myungchul who had been regenerated in his consciousness. He felt the time around him slow down. And because Shin Jonghak was the owner of this space, time had actually slowed in reality.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul slowly got up. Shin Jonghak’s neck stiffened.</p>
<p>His grandfather who he had missed so much. The man who was the guidepost of his life….</p>
<p>His hero was right in front of him.</p>
<p>But Shin Jonghak couldn’t bring himself to move. He couldn’t speak either. He only watched Shin Myungchul as if he were just a mirage that could disappear at any minute….</p>
<p>—It’s been a while.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul spoke in the same old voice that he had missed so much. Dazed, Shin Jonghak stood as still as a statue. Shin Myungchul patted his grandson on the shoulder and went on.</p>
<p>—Jonghak, I have a lot to say to you…. But first, let me start by apologizing. I’m sorry for being a horrible grandfather.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak looked Shin Myungchul in the eye. In the past, he used to only look up at his grandfather. But now, they were equally tall.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul seemed old, but he was still graceful and strong at heart. He continued with a kind smile.</p>
<p>—And… ah, I’m afraid I’m not good with words. What I meant to say was that… Jonghak, I’ve lived inside you for a long time. I’ve felt and experienced the same things you did….</p>
<p>His voice was soft like that of a grandfather reading bedtime stories to his grandson. Listening to his grandfather, Shin Jonghak felt a torrent of emotions form in his heart.</p>
<p>—…When I was alive, and even now, I am distressed by your love. Because it’s too good for a coward like me.</p>
<p>He dared not tell his grandson of his fault. The pain of betrayal his grandson would feel once he learned the truth worried Shin Myungchul more than his own suffering.</p>
<p>—I’m sure you know the truth now and don’t need my explanation. Jonghak, I’m not a hero. Millions have died because of me. I’ve brought many disasters to the world, and most of them are still ongoing….</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul confessed calmly, and Shin Jonghak nodded.</p>
<p>‘I know now.’ Shin Jonghak thought to himself. Shin Myungchul could hear his grandson’s thoughts.</p>
<p>—But even now I still harbor a sense of relief deep in my selfish heart. After all, if I hadn’t gone back in time, I wouldn't have been able to see you.</p>
<p>A bitter smile spread across Shin Myungchul’s face.</p>
<p>—That’s why I can’t truly regret my decision. It would mean denying my love for you.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak felt tears streaming down his face. Shin Myungchul wiped away his grandson’s tears with his big and rough hands.</p>
<p>—…Jonghak.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak nodded in silence, and Shin Myungchul went on.</p>
<p>—Are you happy with who you are?</p>
<p>The two men fell silent. Shin Myungchul smiled kindly. After a moment’s thought, Shin Jonghak nodded. But that was not the correct answer. It took Shin Jonghak a while to finally find the courage to shake his head.</p>
<p>—…It’s good that you admitted it. Always be true to yourself and live without leaving behind any regrets. It’s nothing big, but I’ve left something to help you out. But before that, I have a favor to ask of you.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul put his hand on Shin Jonghak’s shoulder. The weight of the hand seemed to weigh down on Shin Jonghak’s whole body. Feeling overwhelmed, Shin Jonghak turned his gaze to Shin Myungchul. He was determined to grant his grandfather’s wish no matter what.</p>
<p>But what Shin Myungchul said next was completely unexpected.</p>
<p>—Please be the one to correct me. When everything is over, tell the world about my misdeed. Tell them that it was my selfish greed that almost destroyed the world. You should be the one to do so.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak began to tremble. He looked at his grandfather with widened eyes. He couldn’t believe his ears.</p>
<p>To Shin Jonghak, Shin Myungchul was an eternal hero. His grandfather’s past didn’t matter to him. He wanted to continue to admire Shin Myungchul based on his accomplishments and the memories of the days they spent together. Naturally, Shin Jonghak couldn’t imagine the future where Shin Myungchul’s name was tainted….</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul gave a bitter smile and put his hand on Shin Jonghak’s head. He then moved his hand slowly and began stroking his grandson as he had done many times in the past.</p>
<p>—Please, Jonghak. This is my last wish for you. You're free to refuse, of course, and you’ll still get the legacy I promised you, but… I’d really like you to do it.</p>
<p>Those soft words broke Shin Jonghak down. All of a sudden, tears welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak clenched his teeth. But tears were already running down his face. His legs trembled, and he soon began to sob loudly.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak lowered his head in both embarrassment and sorrow. Like a child, he wailed miserably, as in those days of the past.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul stared at his grandson for a long time.</p>
<p>…Finally, the boy’s sobbing stopped, and a nod echoed in the hollow silence.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Baal was thinking of the time when he was still young. It must have been 10,000 or 100,000 years ago. Back then, he was still ‘nothing’.</p>
<p>In those days he was surrounded by a thin film. The beating of his existence began inside that film, and only then could he see and feel the world around him. At that time, he was neither a devil nor Baal. He was ‘nothing’.</p>
<p>However, as time passed, he had naturally become a devil. Whether he wanted to be good or evil, he couldn’t recall. It just came to him one day that he was inherently a being parallel to good. He was designed to be evil.</p>
<p>Believing so, he ripped through the film surrounding him. Immediately his eyes reflected the view of the Transcendent Realm. It was a world full of stars.</p>
<p>There, he earned the name Baal and learned to think by observing humans living in other worlds….</p>
<p>…Baal awoke from his recollection and sighed.</p>
<p>Up until now, he had never wondered about the origin of his existence. But now he had a vague idea of where he came from.</p>
<p>[Returner Hero]</p>
<p>[Views 3,235,212] [Favorites 21,325] [Word Count 1,372,153]</p>
<p>A few numbers and words were all that it took. As much as it was hard to believe, it was the truth. His years of solitude were derived from a crude novel written by a human.</p>
<p>He recalled the world he saw in Bell’s memory.</p>
<p>There were no devils in that world. Religions were only beliefs, and magic couldn’t affect the laws of physics. Humans dominated other species.</p>
<p>Humans did not possess the ability to interfere with abstract concepts, and concepts could not exert power beyond the laws of nature to humans. Humans could not stop time, and time worked fairly for everyone. It was a scientific world consisting of thorough calculations and logical rules, with no room for magical interventions.</p>
<p>Compared to his world, this world was quite plain. The world of ‘extras’, built on complex laws and principles—</p>
<p>Such was the creator’s world.</p>
<p>“Hiyaaap—!”</p>
<p>A loud shout brought Baal to his senses. He opened his eyes and looked at the countless humans rushing at him.</p>
<p>They all appeared resolute. Baal smiled coldly. All of them were nothing but characters in a novel, just like himself.</p>
<p>‘Our existences are all in vain.’</p>
<p>Baal looked up into the distant sky. A huge chunk of metal was floating over his head, and in it was Kim Hajin, the author who created this world.</p>
<p>Baal felt an impulse of anger. He glared at the author and boosted his demonic energy. To descend wholly, he vented his demonic energy like a volcano. The seething energy covered the whole world, encroaching on nature, and drawing all ‘characters’ into Baal’s barrier.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>Baal roared in his barrier and vowed to himself once again.</p>
<p>‘I’ll destroy your precious little world. I will not remain a mere toy.’</p>
<p>Baal’s eyes turned crimson, and his darkness swallowed the world.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Genkelope’s Vessel]</p>
<p>Exactly 30 seconds after the 9-star card disappeared, Shimurin appeared on the spot it vanished from. So, did that mean the 9-star card summoned Shimurin? But why? What kind of relationship did Shumurin have with the mural?</p>
<p>Feeling confused, I looked down at the ground below.</p>
<p>“What the…. They’re all people from the other world.”</p>
<p>Tomer muttered as she observed the soldiers of Leores and Arunheim. I shrugged and turned to her.</p>
<p>“Anyway, you should be getting ready to go down.”</p>
<p>“You want me to go too?”</p>
<p>Tomer raised her eyebrows. She seemed to doubt whether they really needed her help.</p>
<p>“Of course. We need all the help we can get.”</p>
<p>I nodded and took out the Misteltein Bullets that I’d been keeping in my Stigma. The four, long bullets were glowing faintly.</p>
<p>“…What are those?”</p>
<p>Tomer asked, glancing at the bullets. I rubbed the bullets lightly for a few seconds before activating [Synthesis].</p>
<p>[Fusing Misteltein Bullets….]</p>
<p>As soon as the system message appeared, the four bullets merged into one. In addition to Synthesis, I spent all my remaining SP to add the ‘Exorcism’ attribute to the final bullet.</p>
<p>“Woah. They became one.”</p>
<p>Just like that, the ultimate bullet was born. But this alone wasn’t enough to bring Baal down completely.</p>
<p>I showed the bullet to Tomer, who had been watching this entire process with fervent interest.</p>
<p>“This should be able to drive Baal into a corner at least once.”</p>
<p>The weapon was ready. Now the most important thing was timing.</p>
<p>When the strength of all Heroes unite when my luck guides the luck of the others and all the powers of the world come together….</p>
<p>That would be the right time for me to fire this bullet.</p>
<p>And that timing was probably….</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAANG—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly there was a huge explosion, and darkness swallowed everything.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Tomer quickly raised her head. But there wasn’t anything she could do. Immediately the floor of the ship sunk— no, the ship itself disappeared, and the two of us began to fall 4000 meters down to the ground.</p>
<p>“Uaaaaaah-” Tomer screamed.</p>
<p>I summoned Spartan in a hurry. Spartan, who burst onto the scene like a hero, spread his wings and caught Tomer and me on his back.</p>
<p>“Oh my god.”</p>
<p>Tomer clutched her chest and began breathing heavily. Her reaction was understandable; even a superhuman like her would not survive a 4000-meter fall.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I looked around nervously. Genkelope’s Vessel was gone, the sky was gone, the trees and grass were gone, and we were surrounded by endless darkness.</p>
<p>However, when I widened my eyes and looked further, I discovered a lot of familiar faces.</p>
<p>Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, Yun Seung-Ah, Shimurin, Aileen…. Surprised by the sudden change of scenery, they too were trying to comprehend the current situation.</p>
<p>“Hey. Where are we?” Tomer asked.</p>
<p>I obtained information about this place through Observation and Reading.</p>
<p>[Baal’s barrier — A space created by Baal for his descent on Earth. It resembles Baal’s Transcendent Realm.]</p>
<p>Well, it seemed that Baal had done something crazy.</p>
<p>I replied bitterly, “Inside Baal’s barrier.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>“It looks like Baal brought us here.”</p>
<p>I turned my gaze to Tomer. Tomer stared back at me and chuckled.</p>
<p>“So, that means that Baal is down there, right?”</p>
<p>“That would be correct.”</p>
<p>“Okay. Well then-”</p>
<p>Tomer rolled up her sleeves. With a playful smile, she increased her magic power.</p>
<p>“I’ll show you how I earned my nickname Ironblood Duchess.”</p>
<p>Her body began to burn blue. Her eyes and fingers, her heart and her hair— all of them were engulfed in azure flames. She was now the epitome of superhumans only seen in cartoons.</p>
<p>“Okay, then I’ll….”</p>
<p>I nodded and loaded the Mistelin Bullet into the Desert Eagle. The truth was that I was scared, but I pretended to be fine and put my hand on Tomer’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“…Cover you from behind.”</p>
<p>“…Cover me?”</p>
<p>Tomer seemed dissatisfied for whatever reason.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m originally a sharpshooter, remember?”</p>
<p>“…Whatever.”</p>
<p>She nodded discontentedly, then flounced off at a speed faster than my bullet.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 355. Final Name (3)</p>
<p>[Shin Jonghak’s Mind]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t exactly enjoy watching two grown men crying in each other’s arms. Still, she decided not to interfere, for she didn’t want to cause any trouble. She didn’t want to risk losing her chance of obtaining Shin Myungchul’s ‘legacy’, whatever it was.</p>
<p>“…Ssp.”</p>
<p>As Jin Sahyuk watched Shin Jonghak wail like a pig, she wondered to herself why all of a sudden he had become a cry baby.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk crossed her arms and waited for the two to calm down.</p>
<p>—…It’s time for me to go.</p>
<p>When Shin Myungchul finally announced so, Jin Sahyuk let out a sigh of relief. Shin Jonghak shook his head like a baby, but Shin Myungchul was resolute.</p>
<p>The truth was that even if he wanted to stay, he couldn’t. Shin Myungchul’s soul was already starting to fade.</p>
<p>When Shin Jonghak saw his grandfather’s legs become dust and scatter, he lowered his head, sobbing.</p>
<p>—Jonghak. Look at me.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul, however, did not seem to fear death. Clearly concerned about his grandson more than himself, Shin Myungchul gave Shin Jonghak a warm smile.</p>
<p>—Think about all the things you’re going to do as a Hero.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak raised his head and tried to smile. But it wasn’t as easy as he hoped it to be. His face became distorted by tears and forced a smile.</p>
<p>“Pfft…. Hmph.”</p>
<p>When Jin Sahyuk saw Shin Jonghak’s face, she quickly covered her mouth with her hands. She had almost burst into laughter by its resemblance to a squid.</p>
<p>—Jonghak.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul stroked his grandson’s head. All along, Shin Jonghak kept his eyes on his grandfather, trying to remember this moment forever.</p>
<p>—Take care. I’ll always believe in you.</p>
<p>And those were his last words. Shin Myungchul’s body turned to dust and scattered. The dust danced in the air for a few seconds before seeping into Shin Jonghak’s body.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak closed his eyes, feeling a certain ‘power’ sink into him.</p>
<p>“Are you done?” Jin Sahyuk asked.</p>
<p>But there was no reply from Shin Jonghak. He only stood still, breathing in and out repeatedly, feeling the power of the legacy he had received from Shin Myungchul.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk watched Shin Jonghak for a while and quietly disabled her Authority.</p>
<p><em>Crack—!</em></p>
<p>The sound of cardboard breaking rang out. Slowly, Shin Jonghak’s mind started to disappear.</p>
<p>Watching his mind collapse, Shin Jonghak slowly turned to Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>And he said, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>This took Jin Sahyuk by surprise. She wasn’t exactly used to being thanked, nor had she ever imagined she would hear it from Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shrugged.</p>
<p>“Don’t get me wrong. It’s not like I did this for you.”</p>
<p>“Then, what’s your goal?”</p>
<p>“…That’s none of your business.”</p>
<p>Soon the darkness dissipated, and the two of them returned to the normal world. Shin Jonghak and Jin Sahyuk quickly exchanged glances. They then took a step forward at the same time.</p>
<p>Their destination was, of course, the battlefield where Baal was.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak wanted to correct his grandfather’s mistake, and Jin Sahyuk wanted to carry out a certain ‘plan’ of hers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they didn’t have to travel far.</p>
<p><em>Guooooo….</em></p>
<p>Demonic energy swayed in the distance.</p>
<p>When Jin Sahyuk noticed it….</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Baal’s demonic energy raged like a storm. It drove the entire world into darkness. The sky, the earth, and everything in between were captured by Baal, including Jin Sahyuk and Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>They were now inside a giant dome of demonic energy, filled with ominous stillness.</p>
<p>“…Looks like we’re inside Baal’s barrier.” Shin Jonghak concluded.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“This ‘legacy’ thing must really be something. It’s rare for an idiot like you to notice this fast.”</p>
<p>“…Shut up.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak growled at Jin Sahyuk and began running towards the source of the demonic energy. Jin Sahyuk dashed after him.</p>
<p>The two quickly reached the center of the barrier.</p>
<p>There, Baal had revealed his true form.</p>
<p>“Woah…. What the hell?” Jin Sahyuk exclaimed in shock. The other Heroes gathered reacted similarly.</p>
<p>Baal’s body had turned fluid-like. He could have been a sophisticated hologram or even a ghost. Whatever he was, he definitely did not look like a human. Right now, Baal looked more like a dragon than a devil.</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>While observing Baal, Jin Sahyuk discovered a familiar face in the crowd. She immediately doubted her eyes.</p>
<p>He couldn’t possibly be here. He couldn’t possibly ‘exist’.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk widened her eyes in astonishment.</p>
<p>“Bell…?” She muttered.</p>
<p>The man she had killed—Bell—was alive.</p>
<p>He was standing before her very eyes.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stood in a complete daze, and Bell, having heard her call his name, turned his gaze to Jin Sahyuk. And then, he smiled.</p>
<p>Bell’s lips began to move.</p>
<p>—Hey.</p>
<p>“Hey my ass…!”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk wanted to run to him right away.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>Baal howled. He, now in the true form of the Evil God, filled the entire barrier with demonic energy with only a single cry.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk, you wait here.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak stepped forward. Still in a state of shock, Jin Sahyuk watched Shin Jonghak move with vacant eyes.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak misunderstood that she was overwhelmed by Baal and gave a small smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. This is something that I have to do.”</p>
<p>He announced heroically and grabbed the Conqueror Spear.</p>
<p>“And it’s also something that only I can do.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s magic power engulfed the Conqueror Spear.</p>
<p>His energy had become much denser than before.</p>
<p>“You stay in the back. No wait, you should help others evacuate.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s words slowly returned Jin Sahyuk back to her senses. She blinked a few times and finally opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Who do you think you are?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>The two began glaring at each other again.</p>
<p>This time, another Hero approached the pair.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk? Shin Jonghak?”</p>
<p>The pair simultaneously turned to the voice calling their names.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect you two to be together…. So you got caught up in this, too.”</p>
<p>The owner of the familiar voice was Kim Suho. Jin Sahyuk turned her gaze to Kim Suho, then to Chae Nayun standing next to him.</p>
<p>‘Damn it. She was the last person I wanted to see….’ Jin Sahyuk frowned.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaak—!</em></p>
<p>Suddenly a woman engulfed in azure flames burst onto the scene.</p>
<p>“Hmm? Kim Suho? And… Knight Commander Shin Jahyuk, you too?”</p>
<p>That woman—Tomer—noticed Kim Suho and the others and paused.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Far from the battlefield, I was observing Baal. He probably didn’t realize that I was here, for I had masked parts of his barrier with my Stigma.</p>
<p>“Phew….”</p>
<p>About 30-square-meters of the barrier had become mine and this area was free from Baal’s influence. Even Baal in his transcendent form couldn’t detect me as long as I was here.</p>
<p>First I switched Desert Eagle to sniper mode. <em>Clunk— Kiik— Kiik—</em> The familiar sound of machinery rang out. The gun merged with Aether and became as big as a human.</p>
<p>Then I settled into an appropriate position and loaded the Misteltein Bullet into the gun….</p>
<p><em>—tap.</em></p>
<p>It was then that something touched my shoulder.</p>
<p>Even Aether failed to detect the mysterious presence.</p>
<p>I felt my blood boil and my hair begin to stand on end.</p>
<p>But I had no time to panic. I must respond quickly to surprise attacks. I surrounded myself in Aether and looked back…!</p>
<p>“Ugh. You really got me there.”</p>
<p>…The person behind me was Boss. I saw the tip of her lips tremble. It was clear she was enjoying my reaction.</p>
<p>I looked at her discontentedly, and Boss shrugged.</p>
<p>“I did nothing. You misunderstood on your own.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. How did you get here?”</p>
<p>Slowly, Spartan walked out from behind Boss.</p>
<p>Boss wasn’t the only person he had brought here.</p>
<p>“So where exactly are we, Hajin~?”</p>
<p>Jain, Jin Yohan, and Hirano Arashi were here as well. Jain was holding a woman in her arms who had fainted. Though her disheveled hair covered most of her face, I could tell without difficulty that this woman was Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Did every member of the Chameleon Troupe get caught up in this barrier?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Just me, Boss, Jin Yohan, and Arashi. Others are outside.”</p>
<p>“Mm… and her?”</p>
<p>“Oh, her~?”</p>
<p>I pointed at Yoo Yeonha, and Jain raised Yoo Yeonha above her head with a playful smirk.</p>
<p>“She passed out, as you can see. I might have gone too far with my prank~ Anyways, Hajin, you should check your smartwatch! This girl here sent you a very very long text~”</p>
<p>“…Text?”</p>
<p>“Yup~ It’s super long~”</p>
<p>I took out my smartwatch as Jain had suggested. Indeed, I had received a text from Yoo Yeonha. It was so long that, at a glance, it almost seemed like a novel.</p>
<p>I opened the message and tried to read it.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap—</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps rang out. I raised my head, and Boss, who had been looking at my smartwatch with me, did the same. We were all looking in the same direction now.</p>
<p>And immediately, a cold silence set in.</p>
<p>“…Byeol.”</p>
<p>A soft voice called Boss’s name through the icy silence.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun was there.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea — Gaesung]</p>
<p>Baal had captured Korea’s border area in his barrier. But right now, Cheok Jungyeong was far from the border.</p>
<p>He had been observing a city by the name of ‘Gaesung’, currently being destroyed by demons.</p>
<p>This city used to be the heart of Goryeo.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong felt a strange sensation in his stomach as if a lump of heated mass had been thrown in there. He didn’t care much about the people of the present era, but it felt weird to watch demons ravage his hometown.</p>
<p><em>Chweeek— Chweeek— Chweeek—</em></p>
<p>Next to him, the sound of a bow being tugged continued to ring out. Cheok Jungyeong glanced sideways. Jin Seyeon was firing dozens of arrows per second, annihilating demons.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>On the contrary, Cheok Jungeyong crossed his arms and didn’t move an inch. He was still sorting through his feelings.</p>
<p>He had heard that Baal was in northern Korea. Fighting Baal sounded more fun than anything.</p>
<p>But Cheok Jungyeong came here as soon as he found out that Gaesung was under attack. His legs moved on their own. Cheok Jungyeong couldn’t understand why.</p>
<p>“How long are you going to just stand there?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon finally asked.</p>
<p>When Cheok Jungyeong refused to answer, she yelled.</p>
<p>“Stop watching and help me out!”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong looked at Jin Seyeon with cold eyes. Any other person would have averted their gaze, but Jin Seyeon did not turn away.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong asked quietly. “There’s about 100000 of them, no?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon replied brusquely, glancing at her smartwatch. “100000? You wish. The official approximation is 500000.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? Then I guess… we can use her.”</p>
<p>“Use who?”</p>
<p>“You’ll see. I don’t even have to go out there.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong gave a chuckle. Then he began muttering to himself.</p>
<p>“Droon, you see what’s going on here?”</p>
<p>—Yeah. But before that, it looks like Boss and the others got dragged into Baal’s barrier.</p>
<p>Droon’s voice seeped into Cheok Jungyeong’s ears.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter. Boss knows how to take care of herself. So, are you ready?”</p>
<p>—Mm…. How many?</p>
<p>“500000.”</p>
<p>—500000…. We’ll be cutting it pretty close. Though, the worst that could happen is that we lose a city.</p>
<p>“Just do it.” Cheok Jungyeong pressed.</p>
<p>Their conversation ended there. Jin Seyeon was about to ask Cheok Jungyeong what that was all about.</p>
<p>“Excuse me….”</p>
<p>But before she even finished her sentence, something descended from above.</p>
<p><em>KWAAAANG—!</em></p>
<p>What fell from the atmosphere to the ground like a meteorite was a strange-looking creature.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon asked in bewilderment, “What is that?”</p>
<p>“…500000 is too many for you and me to handle alone. Don’t expect me to cut off 500000 heads.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungeyong turned his gaze to ‘it’— Mimyo.</p>
<p>Its skin was black, its eyes were shining crimson, and a pair of long ears rose above its head. From afar, it looked just like a hare, but its existence wasn’t so simple.</p>
<p>Mimyo was a creature from a foreign dimension, an existence that did not belong in this world.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t answer my question. So, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Chameleon Troupe’s ultimate weapon. I’m seeing it for the first time in a long time, too.”</p>
<p>Mimyo opened its mouth, a pair of sharp fangs gleaming inside.</p>
<p>“Ultimate weapon…?”</p>
<p>Mimyo extended its claws, each as long as a baseball bat.</p>
<p>“That’s right. It can’t and shouldn’t be used recklessly.”</p>
<p>A monster that even Cheok Jungyeong couldn’t handle at will.</p>
<p>Having understood the warning, she asked carefully. “…May I ask you why?”</p>
<p>“Because when it goes berserk, it can’t be stopped until it’s fully satisfied.”</p>
<p>All the while, Cheok Jungyeong’s gaze was locked onto Mimyo. Jin Seyeon also turned to the monster.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Kuaaaaaa—!”</p>
<p>Mimyo dashed onto the battlefield.</p>
<p>“…What?!”</p>
<p>Indeed, as Cheok Jungyeong said, its speed couldn’t be matched with the naked eye. Mimyo rushed at demons with its mouth wide open. The demons in its path were all sucked into its mouth.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s brain couldn’t process what she saw. The scene before her eyes was simply abnormal. Jin Seyeon’s jaw dropped and she became speechless.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong said with a smirk. “500000 should be enough to satisfy it.”</p>
<p>Dazed, Jin Seyeon was suddenly overcome with fear. She gulped and asked back.</p>
<p>“…What happens if it’s not satisfied?”</p>
<p>“Well. It’ll eat everything and everyone until it’s full, Hero or human.”</p>
<p>Such was the reason they couldn’t use Mimyo recklessly. When Mimyo went wild, even its owner, Droon, couldn’t keep it under control.</p>
<p>Once stimulated, Mimyo only stopped when it was satisfied. Therefore, the Chameleon Troupe only used it during large scale fights.</p>
<p>The other day, Mimyo had almost destroyed an entire city.</p>
<p>“Eat? That’s—”</p>
<p>“This is how we handle things. If you don’t like our way, leave.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon tried to protest, but Cheok Jungyeong cut her off. Jin Seyeon closed her mouth with a frown. By now, it was clear even to her that Mimyo was their best means of saving Gaesung.</p>
<p>“I’d like to evacuate the Heroes and civilians first.”</p>
<p>“Do as you wish. We’ve ordered Mimyo to attack only demons, but there’s a good chance that humans will get swept away, too.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon nodded and ordered the Heroes of Gaesung to retreat.</p>
<p>[This is a message from the Master-rank Hero Jin Seyeon. Heroes of Gaesung, please stop fighting and focus on evacuating civilians. This is an order. Save as many people as you can.]</p>
<p>After giving out the order, Jin Seyeon put her bow down and turned her gaze to Mimyo.</p>
<p>“KUWAAAAA—!”</p>
<p>She saw Mimyo devouring demons.</p>
<p>It tore with its claws and teeth and chewed with its mouth.</p>
<p>Tear, chew. Mimyo was repeating that simple procedure. That was all it had to do.</p>
<p>Each time Mimyo swung its front paw, demons were torn to shreds, and each time Mimyo opened its mouth, their heads disappeared.</p>
<p>The demons’ attacks, on the other hand, had no effect on Mimyo. The creature continued to eat, digest, eat, digest. Over and over again, until her endless hunger was satisfied.</p>
<p>“…Huh.”</p>
<p>Mimyo was so ruthless that Jin Seyeon almost pitied the demons.</p>
<p>Feeling dazed, Jin Seyeon continued watching the scene of the massacre.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 356. Final Name (4)</p>
<p>[Baal’s barrier]</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun appeared out of nowhere like a ghost. I stood by Boss and looked at him. He was standing still about 20 steps away from us.</p>
<p>“…It’s been a while,” Yi Yeonjun said with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>I glanced at Boss. Despite her attempts to appear calm, I could see that she was having mixed emotions.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Boss stared at Yi Yeonjun without saying anything. Even though she already knew the truth about Yi Yeonjun, that he was the one who ruined her life, she couldn’t bring herself to hate him wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>And I knew where she was coming from. The two of them had spent 20 years of their lives together; of course, it was difficult for her to deny those two decades instantly.</p>
<p>“Boss.”</p>
<p>I placed my hand on Boss’s shoulder. She looked back at me. Her expression was still cold. Was it because she was trying to hide her feelings? Or perhaps it was because even she herself didn’t know how she felt right now.</p>
<p>“I’d like to talk to you about something,” Yi Yeonjun announced.</p>
<p>Boss turned her gaze back to Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“What if we’re not interested in what you have to say~?” Jain asked, studying Boss’s face.</p>
<p>Jane changed the shape of her arm into that of a sickle. Now her arm looked just like ‘Kurukuru’s sickle.'</p>
<p>This was the secret technique Jain had developed in order to increase her physical strength. She named this technique [Monsterification]. It wasn’t a process of awakening per se, but an elaborate imitation of a humanoid monster’s body.</p>
<p>“…Move. You're not the one I’m interested in,” Yi Yeonjun replied flatly.</p>
<p>Jain said with a chuckle, “Well that’s obvious, but-”</p>
<p>“And it isn’t Byul either.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Jain frowned. She glanced at Boss first, and then at me.</p>
<p>A strange sensation engulfed me as I watched Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>“…You.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun raised his arm and pointed at me. At that moment I realized that my sense of discomfort had resulted from Yi Yeonjun’s gaze.</p>
<p>The way he called Boss’s name at first was nothing but a distraction.</p>
<p>From the beginning, his eyes were directed solely at me.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin. I’d like to speak with you.”</p>
<p>Boss couldn’t keep her calm any longer. Her face contorted with anger and she stretched her shadow towards Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>A shrill sound pierced through the air. Yi Yeonjun didn’t dodge. He let her shadow penetrate his flesh and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“It’s important.”</p>
<p>“…You.”</p>
<p>Boss finally ran out of patience and stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Don’t you have anything to say to me…?” Boss asked in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>The volume of her voice was hardly consistent, and her words faded before reaching the end of her sentence.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun stared at Boss for a while and then shook his head. It was then that Boss’s distorted face straightened. She now appeared cold and even apathetic.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin.” Yi Yeonjun called my name again.</p>
<p>“I really don’t feel like chatting with you.” I shook my head. I wasn't sure exactly what he was trying to do, but I didn’t plan on letting things go his way….</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>When Yi Yeonjun said what he said next….</p>
<p>“What if I said it’s about your novel?”</p>
<p>My brain froze and my breathing stopped. I felt as if my heart had stopped beating.</p>
<p><em>Whish—!</em></p>
<p>A familiar sound rang out. Boss’s shadow had reached Yi Yeonjun again. This time, the shadow pierced the area near Yi Yeonjun’s clavicle.</p>
<p>“Boss.”</p>
<p>I stopped Boss and took a step forward. I wasn’t sure how Yi Yeonjun learned about the novel, but I knew that I had to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>“…Hajin.”</p>
<p>Boss grabbed me by the wrist. Her eyes were filled with anger and grief. Yi Yeonjun’s apathy infuriated her more than his betrayal itself.</p>
<p>“…I know.”</p>
<p>I looked Boss in the eye.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re trying to say. But please just give me a minute.”</p>
<p>Gently, I untied Boss’s hand around my wrist. Her heavy breathing soon subsided, and she put on the mask of nonchalance again.</p>
<p>“Thank you. It won’t take long,” I said to Boss and began walking towards Yi Yeonjun. Jain moved out of the way for me.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun stared at me with vacant eyes. His eyes were completely vacant. Perhaps there were days when those terrifying eyes sparkled with innocence; perhaps there was nothing in there, to even begin with.</p>
<p>When I came near, Yi Yeonjun spoke again.</p>
<p>“We need a private space, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Suddenly the darkness under my feet soared and swallowed us both. The darkness formed a distinct space and I came face to face with Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p>It was a barrier within a barrier, so to say.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Baal’s barrier]</p>
<p>“Hmm? Kim Suho? And… Knight Commander Shin Jahyuk, you too?”</p>
<p>Tomer alternated her gaze between Kim Suho and Jin Sahyuk. Kim Suho studied Jin Sahyuk’s face. While Tomer seemed happy to see Jin Sahyuk, Jin Sahyuk looked rather uncomfortable, scratching the back of her neck awkwardly.</p>
<p>“….Ah, my apologies. Haha. I meant to say ‘former’ Knight Commander Shin Jahyuk.”</p>
<p>When Jin Sahyuk didn’t answer, Tomer corrected her mistake. Jin Sahyuk let out a dry cough and averted her eyes from Tomer.</p>
<p>“Hmm? ‘Former’ Knight Commander?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho turned his gaze to Jin Sahyuk. Former Knight Commander? So, did that mean Jin Sahyuk used to be Crevon’s Knight Commander? Jin Sahyuk, who would rather die than work for others?</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sighed and hinted at Kim Suho not to ask.</p>
<p>“Well… anyways.”</p>
<p>Not that any of that was important. Now was not the right time to indulge in Jin Sahyuk’s past.</p>
<p>“Let’s catch up later, because-”</p>
<p>But it turned out they had one more guest. <em>Chwaaaaa—!</em> The swirling wind cut off Kim Suho’s words, and soon a woman with long, blond hair appeared.</p>
<p>It was Rachel.</p>
<p>“Woah. Rachel, you were here too?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, who had been glaring at Jin Sahyuk this whole time, widened her eyes in surprise at the appearance of the unexpected guest.</p>
<p>“Ooh. Rachel! Long time no see!”</p>
<p>Tomer, who had already been acquainted with Rachel at Cube and worked with her in Crevon, welcomed the elementalist with open arms.</p>
<p>“…Yes, it’s good to see you again. Windy? Help them, please.”</p>
<p>Rachel greeted Tomer back with a rather solemn look, and blessed the crew with ‘Spirits’ Blessings’.</p>
<p>…It was then.</p>
<p>—————!</p>
<p>Baal roared as if he had been waiting for this moment. His roar was more than an echo; it was physically visible. Soon Baal’s demonic energy came barreling towards them like a tsunami.</p>
<p><em>KWAAAAA—!</em></p>
<p>The wave of demonic energy surged from all sides. Kim Suho grabbed Misteltein before the wave consumed him.</p>
<p>And then, Misteltein drew an arc in the air.</p>
<p>Kim Suho wielded his sword only once at a speed undetectable to the naked eye. That single attack completely erased all demonic energy as if it had never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Kim Suho had cut the ‘fact’ that Baal had released demonic energy. Such was the power of the secret technique he had learned from his two rounds of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>He acquired the Sword Saint Gift with his first Enlightenment, and with the second he learned the secret sword technique contained in Misteltein.</p>
<p>But in reality, he had been able to wield this technique from the start. The description of him being able to ‘cut everything’ was a decisive hint.</p>
<p>His power— the ability to cut any and everything he wanted.</p>
<p>In the past, he indirectly restricted his power by thinking that he could only cut physical beings and objects. In other words, the problem was his mindset. He never thought to cut what he thought couldn’t be cut. But now he learned to think outside the box and even cut down abstract notions.</p>
<p>Of course, Kim Suho knew that this technique alone was far from enough against Baal.</p>
<p>If he could move one step beyond his own limits if he could enter the state of ultimate swordsmanship….</p>
<p>Then he would finally be able to cut Baal.</p>
<p>“…You.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk turned to Kim Suho with a surprised look. Chae Nayun and the others were simply thinking that Kim Suho’s sword had cut off the demonic energy, but Jin Sahyuk knew better. As the wielder of Reality Manipulation, she immediately recognized Kim Suho’s Authority.</p>
<p>His power could interfere with the laws of the world. It was an ability suitable for the main character. Naturally, Jin Sahyuk’s mind drifted to the novel that Yi Yeonjun had mentioned before.</p>
<p>“Don’t flatter yourself.”</p>
<p>But Shin Jonghak interrupted Jin Sahyuk’s train of thought. He grabbed the Conqueror Spear and walked past Kim Suho. Kim Suho turned around only to face Shin Jonghak’s back. At the same time, he could feel the unfamiliar force surrounding his old rival.</p>
<p>“You wanna bet?”</p>
<p><em>KOOONG—!</em> The Conqueror Spear pounded against the ground. Shin Jonghak stood with his back towards everyone. Facing forward, he went on.</p>
<p>“On who’ll be the first to kill Baal.”</p>
<p>Though Shin Jonghak was serious, Jin Sahyuk found him laughable. After all this time, how was it possible that he still thought he was ‘the main character’? It seemed Shin Jonghak hadn’t changed much even after meeting his grandfather and inheriting his legacy.</p>
<p>Still, Kim Suho answered with a smile.</p>
<p>“Sure. Let’s make a bet.”</p>
<p>“So what’s the prize gonna be?” Shin Jonghak asked as he glanced at Chae Nayun. Unfortunately, Chae Nayun didn’t notice.</p>
<p>After some deliberation, Kim Suho opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Mm…. How about the loser calls the winner Hyung for a month?”</p>
<p>The suggestion was pretty random, but Kim Suho was serious.</p>
<p>He was at least 10 years older than everybody else. For quite some time he had been wanting to hear his friends call him ‘Hyung’ or ‘Oppa’.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to infer Shin Jonghak’s answer from the distorted look on his face. ‘There’s no way I’ll ever call you Hyung’— his expression said.</p>
<p>“It won’t matter if you win. What, are you scared?”</p>
<p>But he couldn't stand Kim Suho’s provocation.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak shook his head.</p>
<p>“Let’s do it.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s magic power engulfed the Conqueror Spear. Kim Suho too grabbed his sword, Misteltein.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do this. Stay alive, okay?”</p>
<p>They loosened up the mood with light conversation and solidified their resolve once more.</p>
<p>Now they were ready to go. Kim Suho took a step forward….</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>A voice flowed into Kim Suho’s ears.</p>
<p>—Kim Suho. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>“Huh? Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho muttered in surprise. The name caught everyone’s attention at once. Chae Nayun, in particular, grabbed Kim Suho’s wrist in a hurry.</p>
<p>“What? Did you just say Kim Hajin? Where is he?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Kim Hajin said his next words.</p>
<p>—Hey, come save me.</p>
<p>It was a call for help.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Paris, France]</p>
<p><em>Whiiish—!</em></p>
<p>Ah Hae-In whistled. It was a signal to call in her divine beast. The whistle with magic power reached the Azure Dragon in the sky, and the dragon descended solemnly.</p>
<p>—Krrr!</p>
<p>Satisfied with the clear blue sky, the Azure Dragon snorted contentedly. Flying monsters such as Gargoyles that once covered the sky had long been wiped out by the Azure Dragon.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In gently patted the dragon’s mouth, then approached the Grand Magician standing in the middle of the ruins.</p>
<p>“…Grand Magician-nim.”</p>
<p>It was thrilling to be able to say 'Grand Magician-nim' out loud. His skills which she witnessed today were indeed a match for the name.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In went on, trying to suppress her overflowing emotions.</p>
<p>“It was an honor to fight alongside you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please.”</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin smiled softly and bent his knees as if trying to sit down. Remnants of a broken bench strewn on the ground swarmed up towards him. They quickly reconstructed into the shape of a bench, and Oh Jaejin slumped down on the finished piece.</p>
<p>Once again, Ah Hae-In was struck with admiration.</p>
<p>“Likewise, it was an honor to fight alongside a talented magician such as yourself. It’s simply amazing that you became a 9-star with only summoning magic.”</p>
<p>“…Y-Y-You flatter me.”</p>
<p>Perhaps he was just trying to be nice. Still, Ah Hae-In couldn’t resist her body from swaying in joy.</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin continued with a smile, “But I’m nearing my limit. I can feel my thoughts scatter, and it’s getting harder to breathe by the minute. You and the other magicians will need to take over for me after this. Perhaps my old friends will lend you a hand. If they can afford to do so, that is.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In knew what Oh Jaejin meant by his ‘old friends’. But only four of the Nine Stars were still alive….</p>
<p>—Magician Ah Hae-In, you must come to Seoul right now!</p>
<p>Suddenly an urgent voice rang from Ah Hae-In’s smartwatch.</p>
<p>The owner of the voice was Kim Sukho, the former President of Korea and the current Chairman of the Hero Association.</p>
<p>“Mr. Chairman, I’m still taking care of the Paris incident.”</p>
<p>—That’s not my problem! Damn it, demons are invading my bunker! Come over at once….</p>
<p>So, what he meant to say was that he needed her to come save him. Ah Hae-In turned the volume down on her smartwatch and turned her gaze to Oh Jaejin.</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin shook his head with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t changed a bit.”</p>
<p>That was all she needed.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In smiled and yelled in an urgent voice.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Demons are coming back to life!”</p>
<p>—What? What did you just say? No wait, it doesn’t matter. Just come here right now….</p>
<p>Kim Sukho’s voice was cut off in the middle.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In removed her smartwatch from her wrist and threw it on the ground. She then turned her gaze to the last devil—Astaroth—at the center of the ruins.</p>
<p>Astaroth looked like a knight in armor. He stared at Oh Jaejin with a huge sword in his hand. Oh Jaejin faced the devil’s gaze from the bench.</p>
<p>“Well then… shall we proceed?”</p>
<p>Oh Jaejin raised himself. Astaroth’s eyes followed Oh Jaejin. The devil acknowledged the strength of the human in front of him and planned to confront him with all his might.</p>
<p>“Allow me to assist you.”</p>
<p>A man that was as strong as a devil.</p>
<p>Grateful and moved by the fact that such a man was on the side of mankind, Ah Hae-In followed Oh Jaejin.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 357. Final Name (5)</p>
<p>[Yi Yeonjun’s barrier]</p>
<p>Inside the barrier, Yi Yeonjun told me everything. His cold voice seeped into my conscience.</p>
<p>He knew everything. He knew that this world was a novel and that I was its author.</p>
<p>“…Do you really believe all that?”</p>
<p>I tried to feign innocence, but it was no use. Yi Yeonjun stared at me coldly with vacant eyes. I could feel his murderous glare poke against my flesh.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun explained, “Baal is transcendent. He can easily distinguish truth from falsehood. Still, he failed to deny your existence, because he found out the truth about himself. The origin of his existence, which he had been studying all his life, was nothing but a character in a novel.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t feel any emotion in Yi Yeonjun’s voice. I chose to remain silent.</p>
<p>“…I want to ask you.” Yi Yeonjun declared, his eyes darkened with rage.</p>
<p>In the stifling silence, I waited for his words to continue.</p>
<p>“Are you the god of this world? Are you playing with us for amusement?”</p>
<p>What a futile question it was. Yi Yeonjun seemed to have already lost his desire for life. He seemed to have given up everything.</p>
<p>I understood him. Just like Yi Yeonjun, I once considered this world was nothing more than a novel.</p>
<p>But now I had a different idea.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>This world was not a novel. It might have started out as one, but just the fact that I was living in it proved that this world, through an inexplicable and unimaginable method, had become something more than just words on paper.</p>
<p>“I’m not a god, and this world isn’t a novel.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun raised one eyebrow. He stared at me with narrowed eyes. His gaze felt hostile and invasive, as if he was trying to tear me to pieces with his eyes.</p>
<p>“You are… deceiving me to the end.”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun’s dry voice filled with anger. With a motion of his hand, the barrier surrounding us began to change its form. The space contorted and pounced at me.</p>
<p><em>KOOONG—!</em></p>
<p>Aether reacted faster than me. It encircled me and resisted Yi Yeonjun’s barrier.</p>
<p>Under Aether’s protection, I took out the Desert Eagle. But I couldn’t fire the gun. Yi Yeonjun choked me with some sort of psychokinesis from a distance, and the Desert Eagle stopped working because of his ability. The trigger got stuck and no matter how much I pulled it, the gun did not fire.</p>
<p>“I already know your toy’s weakness.”</p>
<p>And he certainly did. The weakness of a gun was quite simple when you thought about it. A gun was nothing but a piece of metal unless you could pull its trigger.</p>
<p>—Kim Suho. Can you hear me?</p>
<p>I had no choice but to send a Mental Transmission to Kim Suho. In the meantime, my fight with Yi Yeonjun continued. Yi Yeonjun’s powerful psychokinesis aimed at my neck and waist and all I could do was run away from it.</p>
<p>—Hey, come save me.</p>
<p>I sent a second Mental Transmission. At the same time, I gave orders to Spartan, who traveled through time and space to pick up Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“…Uuk!”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun caught my finger. He crushed my index finger, but fortunately, the bodyguard I asked for arrived in time.</p>
<p><em>Kieeeek—!</em></p>
<p>Spartan shrieked.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun paused to look up at the ceiling of the barrier and saw a huge swath of sword qi pour down at him. He widened his eyes.</p>
<p><em>BOOOOM—!</em></p>
<p>A plume of smoke rose from where the sword strike exploded.</p>
<p>“Phew. I almost died back there.”</p>
<p>I let out a sigh of relief and turned my gaze to the side. There, I saw Kim Suho, whom Spartan had brought…?</p>
<p>“…What the.”</p>
<p>I frowned. The silhouette behind the smokescreen was not Kim Suho’s.</p>
<p>It was definitely too small to be Kim Suho. The hairstyle and the size of the sword also seemed different.</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Though not Kim Suho’s, a familiar voice rang through the white smoke. My eyes widened immediately and my heart began to race.</p>
<p>The violent tremors spread to the rest of my body.</p>
<p>“Long time no see.”</p>
<p>The smoke soon dissipated, revealing a clear view of the scene.</p>
<p>And the person standing before my eyes was….</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>It was Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kim Suho, who was the direct receiver of Kim Hajin’s SOS signal, was running towards Baal.</p>
<p>“…Oi. You sure about Chae Nayun?” Jin Sahyuk asked. Mistrust was writ large on her face. But Kim Suho nodded without hesitation.</p>
<p>When Kim Suho told everyone about Kim Hajin’s Mental Transmission, Chae Nayun insisted that she should be the one to go. Kim Suho complied because he trusted her.</p>
<p>“They’ll be fine, so long as they don’t fight with each other.”</p>
<p>Saying so, Kim Suho thought of Chae Nayun and Kim Hajin. By now Chae Nayun would have arrived where Kim Hajin was and was helping him. ‘What will they argue about? What kind of conversation will they have?’ It was awkward just to imagine their reunion, but Kim Suho sincerely hoped they would reconcile.</p>
<p>“Idiot. …Hmm? Oi, stop.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered brusquely, before urging the group to pause.</p>
<p>Kim Suho also noticed that something was off.</p>
<p>The problem was the perspective, and Baal was the evidence. They weren’t getting any closer to the devil. In fact, as they ran, Baal seemed to be moving away from them.</p>
<p>“Something’s not right.”</p>
<p>“What?” Shin Jonghak hissed. He was pretty pissed at Kim Suho for sending Chae Nayun to Kim Hajin— but he knew this wasn’t the right time for quarrels.</p>
<p>Ignoring Shin Jonghak, Kim Suho began analyzing the components of the barrier in earnest.</p>
<p>It was then that they ran into a herd of people.</p>
<p>This particular group of people consisted of about 100 individuals. They came out of nowhere, and Kim Suho and Rachel flinched in surprise.</p>
<p>“What the… who are you?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho straightened his shoulders. Suddenly Harin, the devil hunter, popped out of the crowd. She stood before Kim Suho with a bright smile.</p>
<p>“Suho-ssi!”</p>
<p>“Huh? Harin-ssi?”</p>
<p>It was then that Kim Suho realized that he recognized these people. They were from either the Republic of Leores or the Kingdom of Arunheim. Kim Suho greeted them one by one, happy to see them again.</p>
<p>“Kim Suho? Are you Kim Suho?”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a magician with long ginger hair called Kim Suho’s name. He turned his gaze to her and nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s me.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I see. I’ve heard a lot about you from Kim Hajin. My name is Shimurin, the grand magician in charge of dimensions.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so?”</p>
<p>When he heard the unfamiliar guest speak of a familiar name, Kim Suho widened his eyes. He knew he could trust Kim Hajin’s friend— that was a firm belief of his.</p>
<p>Again, he chose to ignore Shin Jonghak’s grumble. (“Why is everyone so head over heels for Kim Hajin? What’s so great about him?”)</p>
<p>“Well then, we should hurry. We don’t have much time,” said Kim Suho, pointing at Baal in the distance.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time?” Shimurin frowned and tilted her head questioningly.</p>
<p>“That’s right, we’re in a rush.”</p>
<p>“…What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>With a smirk, Shimurin pointed at Baal. Baal in his transcendent form, who looked just like a dragon, still seemed as hazy as a silhouette. But he was slowly becoming clearer.</p>
<p>“He descended too hastily. He has yet to regain consciousness and does not know how to maintain his form. That’s the reason he created ‘the barrier of labyrinth’.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho blinked in confusion, and Shimurin raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“It means we have enough time to strategize. I see you’re as dense as Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>“Um… no. Hajin is way smarter than me.”</p>
<p>“That’s unfortunate.”</p>
<p>While Kim Suho and Shimurin were talking, Jin Sahyuk was approaching a man surrounded by knights.</p>
<p><em>Tap— Tap—</em></p>
<p>The sound of footsteps rang out. Jin Sahyuk stood before the man.</p>
<p>Assuming there was nothing wrong with her eyes, it was really a familiar face. It was the face of the man who spent the last 20 years with her.</p>
<p>“Halt!”</p>
<p>The knights who were escorting the man blocked her. She glanced at them and turned her gaze to the man again.</p>
<p>The man gave a small smile.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk hated it.</p>
<p>“Enough with that ugly smirk, Bell.”</p>
<p>Enraged by Jin Sahyuk’s comment, Knight Commander Airun stepped forward. She even grabbed her sword, but Bell stopped her.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Airun. We have a lot to talk about. You may leave.”</p>
<p>“I can’t, Your Highness. This woman has disrespected you-”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>Bell spoke softly, but also firmly. Airun glared at Jin Sahyuk with eyes full of hostility and left the scene without withdrawing the gaze.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk pressed Bell, not paying any attention to Airun.</p>
<p>“You’d better explain what the hell is going on.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk couldn’t decide whether to be angry or confounded. What was certain was the fact that Bell being alive came as a shock to her.</p>
<p>She put her hand on Bell’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“If you don’t, I won’t hesitate to kill you again.”</p>
<p>Airun could hear Jin Sahyuk’s dreadfully low voice speaking words of threat.</p>
<p>“You ruffian, how dare you—?”</p>
<p>Airun hurriedly raised her sword, and the other knights did the same. <em>Clang—</em> They unsheathed their swords, and a sharp metallic sound echoed through the barrier.</p>
<p>The atmosphere suddenly became serious.</p>
<p>Tension filled the air.</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Shimurin turned to them with surprised looks.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Still, Bell looked as composed as ever. He smiled at Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>“I do want you to know about how I was able to survive.”</p>
<p>It was a smile of pure joy. Bell was truly rejoicing the fact that he had escaped from eternity, that he could carry on with his life and see it to the end.</p>
<p>"I believe we can reach a happy ending.”</p>
<p>Bell declared, and Jin Sahyuk looked at Bell with distrustful eyes.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Baal’s barrier — The Chameleon Troupe’s camp]</p>
<p>“…Mm.”</p>
<p>Around the same time….</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha finally woke up. Even in a semiconscious state, her ears worked just fine. <em>Koong, koong, koong.</em> She heard thumping sounds.</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was the ceiling made of magic power. Azure magic power was swaying like the surface of the ocean before her eyes.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha lowered her gaze. There, Jain was watching her.</p>
<p>She flinched, and then rose from the bed with a round of fake coughs.</p>
<p>“Cough cough…. Where… am I?”</p>
<p>“You’re at our camp~”</p>
<p>“Camp?”</p>
<p>“Yup. Arashi made it~”</p>
<p>Only then did Yoo Yeonha finally take the time to look around.</p>
<p>She was surrounded by magic power and could feel it in the atmosphere, too.</p>
<p>The structure of the magic resembled that of a magical fortress.</p>
<p>“…It’s a fortress.”</p>
<p>“It sure is~”</p>
<p>Indeed, this space was a fortress made by the Magic Artificer ‘Hirano Arashi’. When Boss revealed her wish to wait at the same place until Kim Hajin came back, Arashi built this fortress for her.</p>
<p>“What are you… doing here?” asked Yoo Yeonha, rubbing her temples to fend away her headache.</p>
<p>“We’re waiting for Hajin to return~” replied Jain.</p>
<p>“Hajin… Kim Hajin?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Because I have to show him this~”</p>
<p>Jain pulled up a smartwatch with a playful smirk. Yoo Yeonha immediately recognized the watch. It was hers.</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>“But that’s mine.”</p>
<p>“That’s right~”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>‘Why is she trying to show my smartwatch to Kim Hajin?’ Yoo Yeonha wondered with a brain still drenched in drowsiness.</p>
<p>Luckily for her, Jain was kind enough to explain why.</p>
<p>“Look, it’s the text you sent to Hajin~”</p>
<p>[Dear Kim Hajin. Hello, this is Yoo Yeonha….]</p>
<p>When she read that first sentence, Yoo Yeonha’s face turned bright red. It was almost as red as a tomato so ripe that it could burst at any moment.</p>
<p>“NO—!” Yoo Yeonha screamed as she jumped at Jain.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 358. Final Name (6)</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s reaction when she first heard from Kim Suho that Kim Hajin was in danger was instinctive.</p>
<p>“I’ll go!” She yelled without hesitation. Rationalization came a moment later. She told herself that this was her chance to repay Kim Hajin for all the times he had saved her and that she would regret it if she let this chance slip by.</p>
<p><em>Kieeeek—!</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a sharp shriek rang out. Everyone turned their gaze to the ceiling of the barrier. A huge eagle was circling above their heads.</p>
<p>“That’s….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho assumed Kim Hajin had sent the eagle, although he felt like he had seen it somewhere before.</p>
<p>“Chae Nayun?”</p>
<p>“Gotcha. Oi—! It’s me—! I’m right here—!”</p>
<p>At Kim Suho's urging, Chae Nayun shouted at the eagle. The giant eagle fluttered its wings and began descending towards Chae Nayun. She realized that this eagle would take her to Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Trying to put aside her worries about seeing Kim Hajin for the first time in forever, Chae Nayun grabbed Spartan’s legs.</p>
<p>With a smirk, the eagle picked up Chae Nayun and began to fly towards Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>They reached their destination in a flash through the distortion in space.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>Hanging on the eagle’s legs, Chae Nayun looked down from the sky. She spotted a man who she knew instinctively was Kim Hajin. He was running around like a rabbit in a black uniform.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>She thought she was prepared to meet him. But when she actually saw Kim Hajin, she felt her heart stop. Unfortunately, there was no time to waste.</p>
<p><em>Kwang—! Kwang—! Kwang—!</em></p>
<p>Several explosions rang out at the same time. The attacks were all aimed at Kim Hajin. Chae Nayun realized that Kim Hajin could die right now if she didn’t jump in to save him.</p>
<p><em>Guoooooo—</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun gathered magic power around her sword. Her magic power swirled violently and adhered to ‘Balmung’. Balmung greedily absorbed Chae Nayun’s magic power and increased in size. Chae Nayun jumped towards the ground and swung her sword that was as big as a pillar.</p>
<p>Balmung crashed into Yi Yeonjun.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaang—!</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun cracked Yi Yeonjun’s head and made a perfect landing. And then, she turned her gaze to Kim Hajin. She could see his face clearly despite the rising smoke.</p>
<p>How long had it been since she last saw him?</p>
<p>Complicated emotions began to swell inside her. Her heart began to race and her breathing became heavier. But this was not the time to get caught up in silly feelings. Chae Nayun felt the enemy rise behind her.</p>
<p>“Whatcha doing down on the ground?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin remained silent, with his butt attached to the ground. From his dumbfounded expression, she could see that he was confused by her sudden appearance.</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, Chae Nayun gestured him to get up.</p>
<p>“Come on. Stop being pathetic.”</p>
<p>Despite her urging, Kim Hajin rose only after a long moment of silence.</p>
<p>“…Cough cough.”</p>
<p>Kim Hajin let out a series of awkward coughs. This was his old habit, and Chae Nayun recognized it immediately.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin checked the Desert Eagle first. He then glanced at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“I’m here to save you,” said Chae Nayun, fixing her grip around the hilt of Balmung.</p>
<p>“…Really?” Kim Hajin answered with a cracked voice.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I know you asked for Kim Suho, but I told him I wanted to go instead. You and I have unfinished business, don’t we?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun did her best to remain poised. Kim Hajin nodded with a faint smile, and it saddened Chae Nayun. What could possibly be the cause of this pain? She stood beside Kim Hajin, stifling her emotions.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Yeonjun stood up. He was covered in blood from head to toe by Chae Nayun’s earlier attack. But now he had a sturdy barrier around him, which unfortunately meant that there was no room left for a second surprise attack.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun gave Kim Hajin a broad smile.</p>
<p>“It feels like forever since we last fought alongside each other.”</p>
<p>And then she activated her flying sword technique. <em>Clang—!</em> The echo of magic power rang out and dozens of magic swords bloomed like a lotus flower.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin stared at Chae Nayun in silence, then nodded with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“It sure does.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Baal’s barrier]</p>
<p>Baal continued to build himself. From a distance, the process of reconstruction seemed to involve lightning intertwining in the air and black fog forming strange shapes.</p>
<p>At present Baal was in an imperfect state due to hastening his descent.</p>
<p>He still emitted demonic energy from time to time. Demonic energy was a kind of waste product that was released during the reconstruction. Whenever this happened, Kim Suho wielded Misteltein and ‘erased’ the existence of demonic energy from this world.</p>
<p>“…Do you really expect me to believe you?”</p>
<p>However, Baal was the least of Jin Sahyuk’s concerns right now. She glared at Bell and hissed.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Bell nodded calmly. A small smile spread across his lips.</p>
<p>“You have to believe me. I’m the proof of my own story. As you can see, I’m alive and well.”</p>
<p>Bell had just told Jin Sahyuk everything. He told her how he survived and was able to come to this world once again.</p>
<p>His story was about a miracle born from hundreds of coincidences, combined with the extravagant luck of a certain man.</p>
<p>“I came back from the void inside Baal.”</p>
<p>Baal had to rebuild the 'first world' in which he contracted with Bell in order to fully descend to Earth. It was a trick he had invented to minimize the universe’s interference and force of deterrence.</p>
<p>Baal reconstructed the first world and connected it to Earth via the Demon Realm Gate. By forming a pathway between the two worlds, Baal successfully weakened the universe’s force of deterrence. The next step in his plan was to destroy the first world, collect the energy that emerged during the process, and use it to finish his descent at his castle.</p>
<p>But the plan went awry when Baal's castle collapsed.</p>
<p>When the unbreakable castle collapsed, Baal lost his means to destroy Earth. As he had no other choice, Baal hastily decided to descend to Earth while keeping the first world intact.</p>
<p>What he overlooked was the fact that the first world was home to the grand magician ‘Shimurin’.</p>
<p>Shimurin was a genius who could acquire the magic of dimensional travel in at least 30 years, assuming she survived. And when she gained the luck called Kim Hajin, this process quickened. Shimurin managed to complete the grand technique of dimensional travel in just 3 days. Indeed, Baal’s hasty decision had come back to bite him….</p>
<p>“Ha. So, you’re saying all this was just a matter of luck?”</p>
<p>“No, not all. I’m largely indebted to Kim Hajin, who you seem to like very much.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk scowled at the sarcasm in Bell’s voice. Bell shrugged and went on.</p>
<p>“Anyway, my point is that I was able to come back to life because Baal made a rash decision. As such, his chances of winning have become slim. Currently, Baal is emotionally unstable. He’s overly influenced by his ‘origin of existence’.”</p>
<p>“The origin of existence…. You mean the novel?” Jin Sahyuk whispered. Bell nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Baal is a transcendental being, which means he can distinguish truth from lie. It also means his ego is unbelievably large. So when he found out that he was merely a character in a novel….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk knew what Bell was going to say next even without hearing him say it.</p>
<p>The fact that this world was a novel— even Jin Sahyuk found it hard to believe.</p>
<p>“Tsk….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk let out a sigh of frustration. Her thoughts drifted to Kim Hajin again.</p>
<p>‘Should I treat Kim Hajin as a god?’ She wondered.</p>
<p>Probably not. Kim Hajin was clearly a human. He was an ordinary and imperfect being. A god wouldn’t let anything so trivial as Synchronization take control of him.</p>
<p>Synchronization.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk still hadn't forgotten it.</p>
<p>“Anyways.”</p>
<p>Bell turned to Kim Suho with a mysterious smile. There, Kim Suho was lost in deep thought, gazing at Baal in the distance.</p>
<p>“Baal can’t win against the main character.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the veins in Jin Sahyuk’s temples swelled up.</p>
<p>“Main character my ass.”</p>
<p>“Haha. So, Sahyuk….”</p>
<p>Bell turned his gaze to Jin Sahyuk again. He then pointed to her chest. That was where Jin Sahyuk had kept the Dimensional Stone she received from Baal.</p>
<p>“When are you gonna use that?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk did not answer. She needed more time before the final decision. She knew that she alone was not enough to help the surviving citizens of Akatrina and rebuild the country from scratch.</p>
<p>In other words, she needed a reliable ‘servant’ to assist her….</p>
<p>“All done. The analysis is complete.”</p>
<p>It was then a woman’s low-pitched voice rang out. Jin Sahyuk turned her head and saw Shimurin drenched in sweat. Shimurin smiled in satisfaction. It seemed she had just finished analyzing Baal’s ‘labyrinth barrier’.</p>
<p>“Everyone, get ready to march.”</p>
<p>Shimurin declared, and the 117 people gathered began to move in perfect order. Jin Sahyuk followed the crowd nonchalantly, and Bell whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>—If you still want Kim Hajin, I’ll help you get him. The truth is that you already know, right? About how this world can cease being a novel.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stiffened. A chill swept over her body. But she walked on without answering Bell.</p>
<p>It was too early to make a decision yet.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Manchurian Plain — Crevon military base]</p>
<p>On a bright, breezy day, Araha, the Empress of Crevon, was looking down at the view below from on top of a hill.</p>
<p>Iron fences surrounded the campsite where tents were lined up in an orderly fashion. The base of the Imperial Army, made up of Crevon’s finest soldiers, was impregnable.</p>
<p>“I believe diplomatic ties and alliances should be supported by mutual benefits,” said Araha.</p>
<p>She wasn’t talking to herself. The President of France, the President of China, the Prime Minister of Japan… and other heads of state filled the seats in front of her.</p>
<p>“Historically, there has been no partnership established without consideration of the interests of both sides.”</p>
<p>Araha called for a meeting the moment she arrived on Earth, and the leaders of many different countries gathered to discuss the terms of a treaty.</p>
<p>Summoning them from their underground bunkers was easy. She relied on the magic of the imperial magicians, who were far stronger than Earth’s magicians.</p>
<p>“Everyone, what do you think?”</p>
<p>Araha asked, and the crowd nodded without a moment’s hesitation.</p>
<p>The Empress gave a soft smile.</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>As obvious as it was from the way she talked, Araha did not intend to provide free aid to Earth. Her goal was to establish a diplomatic relationship with Earth and proclaim rules that would bind both worlds.</p>
<p>She wanted Earth to respect Crevon as a country.</p>
<p>“Did you all sign?”</p>
<p>Soon a pile of written oaths was laid before her. Currently, there were only 30 participating nations, but she expected the number to eventually rise to 190.</p>
<p>But really— how fragmented was this world that divided the continents into 190 countries? Araha felt both a sense of superiority and contempt.</p>
<p>“All set. This completes a temporary alliance treaty between Crevon and Earth. We’ll discuss the details at a later date. Oh, and I hope you will remember to abide by this treaty at all costs.”</p>
<p>The signing of the interim treaty was the first step towards peaceful diplomatic relations. Of course, there wasn’t much she could bring from the outside into the Tower, but if Earth and Crevon continued to interact with each other like this, Crevon could eventually exercise external deterrence on Players.</p>
<p>The article regarding criminal extradition was the heart of the treaty.</p>
<p>So far, there had been no way to catch criminals who committed crimes in Crevon and fled to Earth. But now things were different.</p>
<p>Araha was excited at the thought that she could finally punish the Players wanted for crimes in Crevon.</p>
<p>“Will Crevon's forces be immediately dispatched onto battlefields?”</p>
<p>Japan’s Prime Minister asked in a hurry. Araha glanced at him and gave an elegant smile.</p>
<p>“You know what they say, haste makes waste.”</p>
<p>It was a roundabout way of saying ‘hold on’. Araha let out a dry cough and stood up. She looked down at the campsite and announced in a ringing voice.</p>
<p>“Line up, soldiers of Crevon.”</p>
<p>All the soldiers of Crevon gathered immediately. The spears, swords, and bows in their hands reflected the sun’s rays brilliantly.</p>
<p>“The time has come for us to offer salvation.”</p>
<p>The Imperial Army, made up of 30,000 of Crevon’s finest soldiers, who would have made history had they been born on Earth, cried out to their empress. The roar of loyalty shook the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“As soldiers of a great nation, let's help our poor allies overcome danger.”</p>
<p>Araha’s speech was short but enough to move the hearts of the 30,000 soldiers. The Imperial Army began crossing the Manchurian Plain. They rode on horses and griffins and crossed the land and the sky.</p>
<p>The heads of state watched the scene in awe. Araha sat back in her chair with a smile.</p>
<p>“I heard that there are still many demons left on Earth.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon? Ah, yes, you’re correct,” answered the President of France.</p>
<p>Currently, there were more than 100 million demons rampaging across Earth. Despite the situation, Araha smiled in satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Well then, you may look forward to the future.”</p>
<p>More enemies meant greater glory.</p>
<p>“Because we’ll now turn things around.”</p>
<p>Araha and her army were confident in their victory.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 359. Final Name (7)</p>
<p>[Baal’s Barrier — The Story of Chae Joochul and Heynckes]</p>
<p>Chae Joochul and Heynckes were walking together. Every time they moved, Heynckes’s armor clattered and Chae Joochul’s cane creaked.</p>
<p>The only thing missing from the symphony was their voice. Heynckes and Chae Joochul did not feel the need to open their mouths.</p>
<p>They had lived long enough to not be bothered by silence.</p>
<p>“…This barrier seems to be a labyrinth.”</p>
<p>After a long silence, Heynckes finally spoke. The two of them had been walking for quite a while but were not getting any closer to Baal.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul stopped and nodded.</p>
<p>“You knew that already and didn’t tell me? My, aren’t you naughty.”</p>
<p>Heynckes gave a playful smile. But his comment did not affect on Chae Joochul as he continued to walk in absolute nonchalance. Heynckes shrugged and followed after his friend.</p>
<p>“…It’s no fun being alone with you.”</p>
<p>The two were swept away by Baal’s barrier, just like everyone else. When they opened their eyes they were alone, and there was no sign of anyone else nearby except for each other.</p>
<p>“Hmm. This situation reminds me of the old days. Do you remember the Leocrad Dungeon?”</p>
<p>Heynckes asked with a sigh. The upside and downside of being alone with Chae Joochul were that he couldn’t help recalling the past.</p>
<p>Back then, Chae Joochul was even more annoying than he was now. It was more than a hassle to deal with the frustration of a psychopath-in-progress who was slowly losing his ability to feel emotions. In that regard, Heynckes felt more comfortable around the present Chae Joochul, who had already lost 90% of his emotions.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul paused. Suddenly he thought of a way to escape from this labyrinth. He closed his eyes and raised his magic power.</p>
<p>But the source of Chae Joochul’s power was nature.</p>
<p>His Gift could not be activated in the absence of nature.</p>
<p>“Aha, so yours doesn’t work here either?”</p>
<p>Heynckes smirked. Chae Joochul spewed magic power once again without even looking at Heynckes. And then— some sort of miracle happened. ‘Nature’ transpired from Chae Joochul’s magic power.</p>
<p>“…Woah.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul’s magic power became golden soil that covered the ground of the barrier. In just 3 minutes, the entire scenery turned into a field, and a stream of water began to flow on its surface. The green field and the river continued to expand after Chae Joochul’s magic power.</p>
<p>Heynckes quickly grasped Chae Joochul’s intentions. The stream would split into several branches and analyze the labyrinth. The branches would serve as guideposts to not only Chae Joochul and Heynckes but also the rest of the Heroes inside the barrier.</p>
<p>“You… have the most beautiful power in the world,” Heynckes muttered in amazement, but Chae Joochul remained nonchalant. He continued to walk, expanding nature at every step.</p>
<p>It saddened Heynckes that Chae Joochul had lost all purpose and destination in life a long time ago. In return for acquiring the most beautiful power in the world, Chae Joochul lost what was most precious to him. He became Immortal without the ability to love.</p>
<p>“…Joochul, wait for me.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, a man who lacked emotion also lacked the need for a purpose and a destination in life. Also, it was due to his lack of emotions that Chae Joochul couldn’t feel the loneliness of not being able to love. It was therefore pointless to pity him.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go together.”</p>
<p>Heynckes followed after Chae Joochul. Nature continued to emerge wherever Chae Joochul went. Now other Heroes would be able to use this scenery as a guide to finding the correct path.</p>
<p>Green grass and tall trees.</p>
<p>Enjoying the sight of nature consuming the barrier, Heynckes walked on. For a moment, he felt as if a gentle breeze of wind had brushed his cheek.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kim Suho and others were following Shimurin’s lead. The grand magician was an excellent guide, and they could see they were getting closer to Baal with every step they took.</p>
<p>———!</p>
<p>Baal roared again. Kim Suho swung his sword almost immediately. The crescent mass of energy from Misteltein erased the demonic energy again.</p>
<p>“…Uuk.”</p>
<p>Perhaps that last attack put too much strain on his body. Suddenly, Kim Suho felt dizzy. He got down on his knees and rubbed his temples.</p>
<p>“Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Rachel and the others approached Kim Suho worriedly. “I’m fine,” he said. But even as he said so, he felt nauseous, and his shoulders were way too stiff.</p>
<p>Kim Suho knew instinctively that he could do this only three or four more times at best. He raised himself, trying to contain his nervousness.</p>
<p>“Are you tired?” Bell asked suddenly.</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Bell shook his head with a broad smile.</p>
<p>“No, you’re not tired.”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Your mind thinks you are, but you aren’t. You can’t grow tired, at least not inside this barrier.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho tilted his head, unable to understand Bell’s words, but Bell did not bother to add an explanation.</p>
<p>So they kept walking. Shimurin led them with her eyes closed. She was extremely cautious because one wrong step meant they would have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>However, when they reached a certain point in the labyrinth, everyone had to pause for a moment. They raised their heads with a stiff look. Looking up was the only way they could see clearly the enemy before their eyes.</p>
<p>“…Morax.”</p>
<p>The devil suddenly revealed his huge presence to them. Jin Sahyuk looked up at him, feeling a sharp pain in her chest.</p>
<p>“It seems that he got caught up in this, too.”</p>
<p>Shimurin gave a small smile. Within this barrier, Morax was like Baal’s bodyguard, whose purpose was to buy Baal time to reconstruct himself.</p>
<p><em>Claang—</em></p>
<p>Everyone drew their weapons. They aimed their spears and swords at Morax.</p>
<p><em>Guoooo….</em></p>
<p>Facing them, Morax let out a low, dismal groan. Jin Sahyuk felt like he was crying for some reason.</p>
<p>“Get ready….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk clenched her teeth. Morax was strong, but he was no match for Airun, Harin, and others from the first world. They were born with the inherent ability to resist evil.</p>
<p>“Everyone-”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>Just before everyone rushed at Morax, Jin Sahyuk stepped forward.</p>
<p>Facing the many confused expressions, she announced, “I’ll take care of him.”</p>
<p>Everyone turned to Jin Sahyuk, but Jin Sahyuk’s gaze was locked on Kim Suho. Their eyes met, and just from that, she knew what Kim Suho wanted to say.</p>
<p>“You mean alone, Knight Commander Shin Jahyuk-nim?”</p>
<p>“It’ll be a tough fight.”</p>
<p>Rachel and Tomer objected, but Jin Sahyuk was resolute. She shook her head and went on.</p>
<p>“I can only say this is what I have to do. Above all, we’re running out of time. Your first and foremost priority should be stopping Baal. You shouldn’t waste time here.”</p>
<p>There was a point in what she said. It was enough to convince Shimurin and everybody else.</p>
<p>“…Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked at Jin Sahyuk with eyes full of complicated emotions. She wasn’t the only one who remembered the fall of Plerion. Despite Kim Suho’s concerns, Jin Sahyuk crossed her arms and answered sharply.</p>
<p>“Who said you could call my name?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s lips curved into a smile at Jin Sahyuk’s arrogant comeback. He felt relieved by her unwavering attitude. It suited her.</p>
<p>“…Fine.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho finally nodded. At this point, everyone else had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p>They passed by Jin Sahyuk, wishing her luck. Surprisingly, Morax did not disturb their departure. The devil’s gaze was locked on Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk waited until everyone had left, and then approached Morax.</p>
<p>“We’re finally alone.”</p>
<p>The moment she said so, a man approached her. Jin Sahyuk grimaced when she turned and saw his face.</p>
<p>“Why the hell are you still here?”</p>
<p>“…A little delay won’t cost me my victory.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The man was Shin Jonghak. It seemed that he was trying to help Jin Sahyuk defeat Morax, even though she never asked him to repay her for arranging that meeting with his grandfather.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to help you, you idiot.”</p>
<p>“Just shut up and leave-”</p>
<p>But before Jin Sahyuk could turn him down, Morax began to move.</p>
<p><em>Guuuuo….</em></p>
<p>It was like the roar of a beast. Morax let out a dismal cry and swung his gigantic arms.</p>
<p><em>KOONG—!</em></p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Yi Yeonjun’s Barrier]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun swung Balmung downward. The gigantic sword unleashed fiery magic power that flew right at Yi Yeonjun. Balmung aimed at Yi Yeonjun from the front and her flying swords attacked him from the sides and the rear. As such, there was no physical way to avoid her attack.</p>
<p>But Yi Yeonjun managed to fend off Chae Nayun’s attack with his psychokinesis. <em>Kiiik—</em> Chae Nayun’s magic power collided with an invisible wall, and was lost due to friction.</p>
<p>“That was pretty cool.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun muttered calmly.</p>
<p>“Let’s see how long you can last.”</p>
<p>She could repeat the previous attack a dozen times more. Her Gift was [Sea of Magic Power]. It was named so because her magic power capacity was as big as the sea.</p>
<p>When fighting, she never lacked magic power.</p>
<p>It was by no accident that her specialty was a prolonged battle. She was well known for her endless stamina.</p>
<p><em>Woosh—</em></p>
<p>At that moment the barrier began to move. Yi Yeonjun tried to crush Chae Nayun by shrinking his barrier. But Chae Nayun managed to push the walls away, and Kim Hajin fired the Desert Eagle in a brief moment when Yi Yeonjun was off guard.</p>
<p><em>Kwagwagwagwa—!</em></p>
<p>Countless Venomous Basilisk Bullets flew at Yi Yeonjun. He dodged the bullets and glared at Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun could feel anger boiling up inside him.</p>
<p>Before his eyes were the creator of this world. Sadly, Yi Yeonjun was disappointed with him. He hated the fact that his creator was a human, just like himself. The creator was neither graceful nor elegant nor radiant.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa-!</em></p>
<p>‘What have I lived for?’ Yi Yeonjun wondered, blocking Chae Nayun’s sword smashing down on him from all sides.</p>
<p>Because he was born into this world without anything to call his own, he desired everything.</p>
<p>He wanted to rule Pandemonium and everything else he could see.</p>
<p>In a pit of despair called life, only his possessions gave him meaning. Greed and obsession helped him to survive. Had it not been for them, Yi Yeonjun would have lost his meaning in life and died a long time ago….</p>
<p>It was then that Yi Yeonjun recalled the face of the most precious treasure he had ever owned. Her jewellike eyes and long black hair that swayed like waves— he remembered them all.</p>
<p>The treasure’s name was Yi Byul.</p>
<p>But that treasure was no longer his. She used to be in his hands, which was where she should have stayed forever, but… the man before his eyes stole her from him.</p>
<p>Such a trifling man robbed him of everything.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun’s rage turned into tears that streamed down his cheeks. He aimed at Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>He planned to blow up his own barrier, the space itself. It would mean double suicide, but Yi Yeonjun felt his life was meaningless anyway. His life was nothing but a story in a novel.</p>
<p>But Kim Hajin’s life was different. His life had a real meaning. So if Yi Yeonjun could bring about Kim Hajin’s death, then it would be his first and last meaningful action.</p>
<p>“——!”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun roared. He then tried to detonate the barrier using the remainder of his magic power. He reaped the fruits of his efforts when the barrier began to crumble. There was only a little left until everyone in the barrier had a painful death.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun suddenly realized that he could not move his body as freely as he had hoped. The shrinking of the barrier paused, and Yi Yeonjun’s vision became blurred.</p>
<p>He fell down. Black blood spurted out of his body and soaked the ground.</p>
<p>“Ah….” Yi Yeonjun muttered.</p>
<p>His body lost the ability to breathe. His limbs became limp.</p>
<p>‘How…?’ Yi Yeonjun wondered. ‘What kind of trick is this?’</p>
<p>Kim Hajin hadn’t moved an inch, so how was this possible?</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun’s eyes reflected the treasure that once belonged to him.</p>
<p>The treasure—Yi Byul—was much more beautiful than he remembered.</p>
<p>Yi Byul was looking down at him with cold eyes. Yi Yeonjun stared at her with his half-shut eyes. He tried to contain every fragment of her beauty in them.</p>
<p>And she… was too good to be the last thing he saw.</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun never blinked to his dying breath.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 360. Final Name (8)</p>
<p><em>Psh—!</em></p>
<p>The sound of stabbing flesh rang out. The black blade pierced Yi Yeonjun’s stomach, and he fell slowly, and helplessly, like a puppet with its strings cut.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I lowered the Desert Eagle and looked forward.</p>
<p>Boss stood behind Yi Yeonjun, who had fallen. Blood was dripping from her hand.</p>
<p>“Ah-”</p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun let out a cry. He tried to move his neck, but it was hardly a struggle for survival. Yi Yeonjun seemed to want to capture Boss in his vacant eyes for as long as possible.</p>
<p>But why would he do that? Because he wanted to know who killed him? Or did he want to see Boss one last time?</p>
<p>I couldn’t figure out the answer, but I wasn't very curious anyway.</p>
<p>What I really wanted to know was why Boss was here.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my curiosity was quickly satisfied. I spotted Spartan, who popped his head out from behind Boss’s leg.</p>
<p>Clearly, he was the one who brought Boss here, even though I didn’t ask. Boss might have asked Spartan to bring her here. Perhaps Spartan made an independent decision to save me. The exact circumstances were unknown, but I could see that Spartan was extremely exhausted from multiple trips through distorted space.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun looked at Boss and me in bewilderment. She raised Balmung thinking that Boss might be an enemy, but Boss looked at Chae Nayun without a hint of hostility.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun slowly lowered her sword. And then, she turned her gaze on me.</p>
<p>“…Hey.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun called me. I answered with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun looked at me in silence. Her lips moved as she chose her words carefully; but what finally came out of her mouth after long deliberation was a notice of postponement.</p>
<p>“Let’s catch up later. We don’t have time right now,” She muttered with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Her words saddened me. How much time did I have left in this world? Will I be able to sort things out with her before everything is over?</p>
<p>“No, wait.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun frowned as if she had suddenly changed her mind.</p>
<p>“Hey, you!”</p>
<p>She yelled and grabbed me by the collar. Though she took me by surprise, I couldn’t help but smile. Her unpredictable disposition was what I liked the most about her.</p>
<p>“…You ass- I mean, stupid… person… who’s always running away.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun carefully chose her words. Struggling not to swear, she sounded a little awkward.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea what you mean to…. And…. Ugh. Just tell me. Explain everything to me.”</p>
<p>It was then that Boss moved. She carried Yi Yeonjun’s body on her shoulder. Chae Nayun flinched.</p>
<p>“What does she need the dead body for? Wait, more importantly, who is she?” Chae Nayun whispered to me.</p>
<p>The barrier dissolved immediately when Boss removed Yi Yeonjun’s body. The crust of the barrier shook and cracked open.</p>
<p>“Boss! You’re b-”</p>
<p>We returned to Baal’s barrier, and Jain and the other members of the Chameleon Troupe welcomed Boss. Jain ran to Boss with a smile, but her expression stiffened when she saw Yi Yeonjun’s body on Boss’s back. Boss nodded without a word, and put Yi Yeonjun’s body down onto the ground.</p>
<p>“…I don’t know what to say~”</p>
<p>Jain mumbled and looked closely at Yi Yeonjun. In his wide-opened eyes was Boss’s shadow.</p>
<p>Jain gave a small sigh and closed Yi Yeonjun’s eyes for him.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Is that Nayun?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha, who had been resting in the fortress, suddenly yelled. Only then did Jain notice that there was one more person here besides Boss and me.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun turned to Yoo Yeonha in surprise.</p>
<p>“Yeonha?”</p>
<p>Their eyes met, and the two hesitated for a moment before rushing into each other’s arms.</p>
<p>I watched them for a while, and then turned my gaze on the fortress built by Arashi.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Arashi’s Magic Fortress]</p>
<p>—A magic fortress built by Hirano Arashi, the master of fortress building</p>
<p>*Increase attacks from within the fortress to outside by 20%</p>
<p>*Increase defense against attacks from outside the fortress by 20%</p>
<p>—The Dignity of a Master</p>
<p>*Enhance Summoned Beasts</p>
<p>*External Automatic Artillery</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>There were many useful functions attached to the fortress. But looking into them in detail would have to come later. I had something more important to do right now.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Boss was standing in a daze and looking down at Yi Yeonjun’s body. There was no sadness, no joy, no resentment in her eyes. It was as if Yi Yeonjun’s emptiness had infected her.</p>
<p>I approached her slowly. But she avoided meeting my eyes. Slowly, I whispered her name.</p>
<p>“Yi Byul.”</p>
<p>Boss flinched. Her lifeless eyes looked up at me. They were still as beautiful as a pair of obsidian but they had lost their sparkle.</p>
<p>I wanted to hold her in my arms.</p>
<p>[Starting the Final Arc.]</p>
<p>But then a sentence appeared before me, that seemed to remind me that it was not yet time.</p>
<p>I read that sentence.</p>
<p>[The completion of this arc will unlock ‘???’]</p>
<p>The last arc.</p>
<p>The final destination of a long journey.</p>
<p>I clenched my fists.</p>
<p>I had to finish this last arc in order to put a proper end to everything.</p>
<p>Only then would I be able to define my existence.</p>
<p>I decided to save my feelings for that final day.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>I held Boss’s hand in mine. Her hands were cold, and shaking as if they were crying for her.</p>
<p>“Hey Boss.”</p>
<p>I asked in a soft voice, holding her hand in mine tightly.</p>
<p>“Do you still remember my name?”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>Koong—!</em></p>
<p>Morax slammed his fist into the ground. Jin Sahyuk recalled the past as she dodged Morax’s fist. She thought of her half-brother, Prince Puharen, the legitimate heir to the throne of Akatrina who feared becoming King.</p>
<p>“…Puharen.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk called his name.</p>
<p>The prince did not want to be king, but the tradition of the kingdom was not something he could ignore. Puharen’s servants wanted him to rise to the throne.</p>
<p>They never gave him a chance to decide for himself. They wanted a king they could easily control. Even as demons rampaged through the streets and their kingdom sunk into the dirt, they still only cared about their power and security.</p>
<p>“I’ll save you from them.” She lied to her brother.</p>
<p>And then she threw her innocent brother into a dungeon where he stayed until he died.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Levitating in air, Jin Sahyuk muttered words of apology.</p>
<p>Puharen— no, Morax gazed at her. What a pitiable being! Her brother, the victim of her greed and ambition, was denied a peaceful rest even after death….</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Morax appeared before Jin Sahyuk. She realized too late that the devil’s fists were headed for her.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>Shin Jonghak thrust his spear for Jin Sahyuk. The pressure from his spear pushed Morax away.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk breathed heavily. Her heart was racing.</p>
<p>She turned her gaze to Shin Jonghak, reproaching herself for being shaken by the past.</p>
<p>“Stay focused. You’d be dead if it wasn’t for me,” Shin Jonghak said with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Guess you aren’t completely useless,” answered Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>She took a deep breath and collected herself. Someone who could sacrifice morality for her own ambitions and murder her brother without hesitation— that was the kind of person she was, after all.</p>
<p>“…Rest in peace,” Jin Sahyuk looked up at Morax and muttered.</p>
<p>At that moment, however, an unexpected pair of guests appeared before them.</p>
<p>“What the hell…?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spotted the two silhouettes behind the gap between Morax’s legs. One had the appearance of an insect, and the other….</p>
<p>“Orden?”</p>
<p>…Was Monster King Orden, whom she had been acquainted with in the past.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Kim Suho followed Shimurin. The closer they got to Baal, the greater the number of demons. Difficult battles followed, but thanks to Aileen, Yoon Seuang-Ah, Yi Younghan and many other Heroes who joined along the way, they were able to win without casualties.</p>
<p>“So you’re a magician from another world?”</p>
<p>Aileen asked Shimurin.</p>
<p>Shimurin nodded but said nothing, and concentrated on her role as the guide.</p>
<p>“…Well, sure. I don’t like chatting either, so let’s just walk.”</p>
<p>Aileen pouted and walked along Shimurin. The Heroes moved forward amidst the tension.</p>
<p>How long had it been?</p>
<p>By the time the demonic energy penetrated into their bodies and its pressure seemed to crush their hearts, they finally arrived at the center of the barrier.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>“That’s….”</p>
<p>Many exclaimed in both amazement and horror.</p>
<p>Baal was much larger when viewed closer than from afar. The Heroes were overwhelmed by the mere sight of him. The demonic energy flowing out of his body kept humans from getting close to him, and the bodies of fallen Heroes were scattered under his feet.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Kim Suho stared into Baal’s eyes, which looked like two black holes. They contained many worlds within them. Everything Baal had ever destroyed was displayed in its eyes. The fallen worlds were screaming in agony. Enraged, Kim Suho grabbed Misteltein. The god-slaying tree branch had become a holy sword through Enlightenment and Awakening and was ready to strike at evil.</p>
<p>"Glad to see you again, everyone.”</p>
<p>A voice brought Kim Suho to his senses.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to where the voice had come from. They saw Master-rank Heroes Yoo Sihyuk and Yoo Jinwoong. Following the two, dozens of Heroes gathered where Kim Suho and his friends were.</p>
<p>"How did they escape from the labyrinth?"</p>
<p>Shimurin muttered in confusion. How could they have found their way through such a complicated labyrinth without the kind of knowledge that she had?</p>
<p>Her curiosity was quickly satisfied when ‘nature’ suddenly appeared in the barrier. Soil covered the dark void on which everyone was standing, and the empty sky turned blue. Two men appeared beyond the landscape of nature. Everyone turned their attention to them, and they walked all the way to the center of the barrier.</p>
<p>"…Haha. It seems we have lots of comrades here."</p>
<p>Chae Joochul remained calm even when he saw Baal, and as usual, Heynckes opened his mouth first.</p>
<p>“Say, before you all leave, would you care to listen to what this old man has to say? I’ve fought in many wars, and I’d like to make some strategic suggestions based on my past experiences.”</p>
<p>Heynckes suggested, and the Heroes, including Kim Suho, nodded without a moment’s hesitation. They all admired Hyenckes, a member of the Nine Stars.</p>
<p>But Airun, who came from a different world, seemed hesitant. She looked at Heynckes with suspicious eyes and whispered to Bell, who stood beside her.</p>
<p>“Would it be wise to trust him? Your Highness, please consider taking refuge in a safe place.”</p>
<p>She hoped to persuade the prince to leave the battlefield. But Bell turned down Airun’s offer with a smile and turned his gaze to Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“No worries. We’re going to win this fight.”</p>
<p>Bell sounded extremely confident; it was almost as if he had seen the future.</p>
<p>Perplexed, Airun asked cautiously.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Look over there.”</p>
<p>Bell pointed to Kim Suho, who was listening to Heynckes with Misteltein in his hand.</p>
<p>Bell was confident in Kim Suho’s victory.</p>
<p>Kim Suho was ‘designed’ to be the winner of this fight from the start.</p>
<p>Baal chose to descend inside a barrier in order to avoid the interference of the world. But this was a mistake. Baal was not the only one under the influence of the world’s interference.</p>
<p>“He’s the main character of this world afterall.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho.</p>
<p>He was also under the influence of this world, just like Baal.</p>
<p>The world’s deterrence was weakening his power.</p>
<p>“Main character…?”</p>
<p>“I don’t expect you to understand.”</p>
<p>The world's deterrence limited Kim Suho’s power to ‘human level’. But the said constraint did not exist in this barrier, for this barrier was technically Baal’s world.</p>
<p>So what would happen if there was less interference?</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s power would no longer be bound to the limits set by the world.</p>
<p>Baal had unwittingly removed Kim Suho’s shackles by bringing him into this barrier.</p>
<p>“I’m just saying he’s going to win no matter what.”</p>
<p>Baal's defeat had been predetermined by fate.</p>
<p>Yes, fate.</p>
<p>Everything was all part of a novel with a prearranged beginning and end….</p>
<p>"Do you understand?”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Heynckes’s explanation was over.</p>
<p>The Heroes roared and lined up for the upcoming battle.</p>
<p>"Good. Now let us pray to God, as we prepare for this final battle."</p>
<p>Heynckes declared solemnly and raised his steel sword.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 361. Final Name (9)</p>
<p>“You haven’t forgotten my name, right?”</p>
<p>I asked while holding onto Boss’s hand. She stared at me fixedly before slowly tilting her head. It was as if she was asking what I was talking about. And for a moment, her expressionless face turned to fluster.</p>
<p>It was a change I was quite happy about.</p>
<p>I pretended to be disappointed and asked again.</p>
<p>“You forgot?”</p>
<p>“…Hajin.”</p>
<p>Boss murmured in a quiet voice with a somewhat dissatisfied look. She seemed to be saying she wasn’t in a mood to joke around.</p>
<p>However, I asked again. I couldn’t be comfortable with just hearing my name.</p>
<p>“My last name too.”</p>
<p>Boss’s eyebrows perked up. Of course, it was only for a split second, and she soon returned the answer ‘Kim Hajin’.</p>
<p>But that was enough evidence. I felt like I understood what the final [???] was.</p>
<p>“Why are you asking me all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“…No reason. Anyways, thanks.”</p>
<p>I raised Boss’s hand. She flinched as if she didn’t realize I was holding her hands until now.</p>
<p>Her cheeks flushed red, but she soon collected her composure and let go.</p>
<p>“Go. I want to be alone right now.”</p>
<p>She chased me away like shooing away a fly.</p>
<p>I turned back with a bitter smile. Boss glanced at me several times before creating a coffin out of her shadow. Jin Yohan, Arashi, and Jain approached her.</p>
<p>I didn’t wait to find out what happened next.</p>
<p>I stopped in front of the stronghold, the magic power fortress taking root in the part of the barrier I purified. I looked inside the fortress wavering with magic power. My Thousand-Mile Eyes could peer into even a master artisan’s work.</p>
<p>—…By the way, who are the people outside?</p>
<p>—Ah~ You’ve heard of them, right, Nayun? They’re from the ‘Chameleon Troupe’.</p>
<p>—Yeah, I’ve worked with them during the Orden mission.</p>
<p>—Yep, that’s them. I hired them.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun were talking with each other. Then, Chae Nayun glanced outside.</p>
<p>—Then that woman is also from the Chameleon Troupe? She seems to be… rather close to Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>—Oh, that? Well, you know, Kim Hajin did a lot of work in the shade. They must be acquaintances from that time.</p>
<p>—They’re too touchy to just be acquaintances though….</p>
<p>—…Maybe they’re close acquaintances.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha tricked Chae Nayun without much effort. She lied naturally without even batting an eye.</p>
<p>“…Whew.”</p>
<p>Before I entered the stronghold, I took another deep breath and closed my eyes. I checked my Stigma, which was slowly recovering. Thanks to the [Orb of Regeneration], more than two streaks had already been filled.</p>
<p>I focused one streak into my eyes.</p>
<p>Immediately, my vision shot up into a satellite view. Looking down from a lofty height, I could see everything from a third-person perspective, and I quickly spotted Baal.</p>
<p>Kim Suho, Chae Joochul, Rachel, Heynckes, Aileen…. Almost all Heroes I knew were fighting Baal. I could even see Shimurin, Harin, and even 'Bell'.</p>
<p>Even though Baal was right in front of me, I had no choice but to watch from afar. It was funny saying this at this point, but that was the role of an 'extra'. At least for now, my job was simply to assist them from a distance.</p>
<p>However, Chae Nayun was different.</p>
<p>She would be able to awaken her true worth by facing Baal.</p>
<p>After thinking this far, I let out a few dry coughs before entering the fortress. At last, Yoo Yeonha and Chae Nayun's chatter stopped.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stood next to Yoo Yeonha and asked while she stole glances at me.</p>
<p>"…What were you doing?"</p>
<p>She scratched her head somewhat awkwardly. Yoo Yeonha noticed how Chae Nayun and I were acting and let out a bitter smile.</p>
<p>I said to her, "You don't need to know that. It's about time we go back."</p>
<p>"…Y-Yeah, I was just about to…."</p>
<p>Chae Nayun replied while furrowing her brows. She seemed to be dissatisfied with something.</p>
<p>"I'll be back soon, Yeonha."</p>
<p>Chae Nayun got up after tapping Yoo Yeonha's lap a couple times. Yoo Yeonha also tried to get up, but I stopped her.</p>
<p>"You stay here. You're weaker than even me."</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha immediately pouted. Her protruding lips moved like a bird's beak.</p>
<p>"At least let me say goodbye."</p>
<p>She then held Chae Nayun's hand and whispered into her ear. Chae Nayun laughed as if she had been told a joke. Yoo Yeonha then sat back down.</p>
<p>"Okay, you can take her now."</p>
<p>I left the stronghold with Chae Nayun. She tried to go right away, but I grabbed her wrist and stopped her.</p>
<p>"Wha—"</p>
<p>The moment my hand touched her, Chae Nayun jumped like a cat who stepped on a needle.</p>
<p>"W-What! What is it!?"</p>
<p>"I have something to give you."</p>
<p>I smiled faintly. There was something I needed to give her before she left.</p>
<p>"G-Give what?"</p>
<p>I silently took out a necklace from my pocket. A carefully crafted fingernail-sized diamond hung on a blue string.</p>
<p>This was an item that would replace what she should have had in the original story. I had crafted this [Magic Power Amplification Blue Diamond Necklace] with care.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Chae Nayun dropped her jaw as she stared at the necklace. Even inside the barrier's darkness, it shone brightly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Magic Power Amplification Blue Diamond Necklace] [Pinnacle-grade] [Masterpiece]</p>
<p>- The work surmised to be crafted by a famous Dwarf. Special magical effects are enchanted on it.</p>
<p>—High-rank Magic Power Amplification</p>
<p>—High-rank Magic Power Circulation</p>
<p>—High-rank Mental Interference Immunity</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Thanks to using high-quality ingredients, it was equal to or above Homer's Ring in functionality. I gave it a blessing with Stigma's magic power before putting it in Chae Nayun's hand.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared at it blankly.</p>
<p>I tapped on her shoulder and spoke.</p>
<p>"You can tell how good it is, right? Be sure to give it back later."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Chae Nayun's gaze shot up before falling on the necklace once again. This time, she seemed to be checking the effects of the necklace rather than its outer appearance. Soon, she smiled and nodded her head.</p>
<p>"…Right, there's no way something like this would be a gift. Alright, thanks. It should help out a lot."</p>
<p>Chae Nayun put the necklace on, thinking only about its utility. The change happened immediately.</p>
<p><em>Guooo….</em> A blue aura rose up around Chae Nayun. The uncontrolled current of magic power escaped in all directions. But, as expected of Chae Nayun, she suppressed the amplified magic power with just a breath.</p>
<p>"Whew, done. What about you, Kim Hajin?"</p>
<p>Chae Nayun asked.</p>
<p>I tapped on the Desert Eagle in my hand and answered.</p>
<p>"I'll support you guys with this."</p>
<p>That was the best thing I could do at the moment. I had to search for an opening to drill the god-slaying bullet into Baal.</p>
<p>"What a scaredy-cat."</p>
<p>Chae Nayun grinned.</p>
<p>There was no need for me to feel bad. It was true. So, I simply nodded my head.</p>
<p>"You know me. I always run away or shoot from far away."</p>
<p>"And you're going to do that until the end?"</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared into my eyes. Her big, clear eyes carried her sincere feelings. I answered truthfully as well.</p>
<p>"…Yeah. But maybe I can stop running away when everything ends."</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Chae Nayun silently thought about what I said before tilting her head confusedly.</p>
<p>"Okay, so you're saying you won't run away after this, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p><em>I'm okay with that.</em> Chae Nayun murmured before laughing out loud.</p>
<p>"Then see you later."</p>
<p>That was the final goodbye.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun watched Chae Joochul's nature rising in the distance. In that instant, she ran off without hesitation. She ran without turning back, to that 'final' place.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The Heroes assumed a loose formation. Since going all out would only result in their death, they wanted to take it slow and understand Baal's attack patterns first.</p>
<p>Bell didn't think that was a bad tactic. As Baal had yet to fully descend, his attack patterns were simple, and the Heroes could slowly chip away at him without being sacrificed.</p>
<p>Bell called this the 'Toothpick Tactic', hoping Baal would eventually fall if he was poked by toothpicks endlessly.</p>
<p>However, not all toothpicks were the same, and some couldn't even be called toothpicks. Kim Suho was the prime example. He cut apart Baal's demonic energy while directly affecting its true body.</p>
<p>"Haa…. Haa…."</p>
<p>But now, Kim Suho was reaching his limit. His body was drenched in sweat, and his hands were barely holding onto his sword. Most importantly, he was running low on magic power.</p>
<p>Seeing Kim Suho out of energy, Bell clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>Kim Suho's fuel efficiency simply wasn't good. Because he was trapped within a mental barricade, he was wasting too much magic power, despite only needing a simple change in thinking to face Baal alone.</p>
<p>That said, Bell couldn't help him with this problem. Kim Suho had to realize this himself for it to have any effect.</p>
<p>"How troublesome…. I can't see an end to this."</p>
<p>At that moment, Heynckes muttered softly. Unlike Kim Suho, Heynckes and Chae Joochul weren't efficient in damaging non-physical beings.</p>
<p>In fact, there weren't many Heroes who were capable of damaging Baal's true body. Other than Kim Suho, only Rachel and Aileen were worth mentioning. Thankfully, the power of these two women wasn't on the level of a mere toothpick.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>A faint tremor shook the barrier. Some Heroes might not have felt a thing. However, Bell clearly felt it - the quickening of death issued from Baal's heart.</p>
<p>"…Hm."</p>
<p>Bell fell in thought. Should he escape to save the finite life he finally reclaimed? Or should he stay to watch the interesting spectacle develop?</p>
<p>However, Bell's old friend Baal did not give him any time to decide.</p>
<p>—Pathetic insects who cannot even touch the edge of true existence.</p>
<p>His calm murmuring resounded clearly from what seemed to be the mouth of the true body. All Heroes widened their eyes.</p>
<p>Baal glared at them with his distant, piercing gaze. His eyes, which had been filled with nothing but vast darkness, now carried a powerful, transcendent power of destruction. Just staring at his eyes caused a few Heroes to collapse.</p>
<p>—Why struggle so much to continue such pitiful lives?</p>
<p>The devil so transcendent that he could not exist in the material realm - Baal - finally descended successfully.</p>
<p>—Death suits you all more.</p>
<p>This sentence marked the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>Baal infused the power of destruction in his breath. A storm of demonic energy brewed from his origin. This was the same 'breath' that had destroyed countless worlds in the past.</p>
<p>It swallowed everything inside the barrier.</p>
<p>Kim Suho swung his sword with what little power he had left, but it 'looked' like it didn't reach Baal….</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…<em>Tadadak—</em></p>
<p>A campfire was crackling. The shadow of a fire danced on the ground. Inside a cave filled with deathly silence, Kim Suho was with his king, the ruler of an already-ruined kingdom.</p>
<p>Was her name Priha or Praha? Kim Suho didn't care to find out. He currently didn't even know his own name.</p>
<p>Kim Suho offered the food he cooked on the campfire to his king. It was a simple dish cooked by adding herbs and potatoes in an earthenware pot. As he was lucky that day, he was able to obtain two abandoned potatoes.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at the dish with vacant eyes before grabbing it with her hand and taking a bite. After that, she quickly began to devour it. Kim Suho didn't expect any of the food to come back to him.</p>
<p>He thought it was enough if he could help relieve his king's hunger even a little bit.</p>
<p>Right, he thought it was enough.</p>
<p>But when she finished eating, Jin Sahyuk confessed what should have never been said.</p>
<p>'I killed your master to obtain you. It was all a ploy to cut you off from Puharen and have you offer your loyalty to me. I could have saved your master, but I ended his life to save money. Because with the same amount of money, I could have saved a hundred subordinates.'</p>
<p>Kim Suho still didn't understand why Jin Sahyuk said this. Was it because she was grateful? Or did she want to confess her sins before death?</p>
<p>Regardless, Kim Suho became furious. Even though the world fell, rage ignited from the bottom of his heart. No, he raged precisely because the world fell.</p>
<p>The concept of a king or a knight no longer existed in this world. Since everything had fallen to ruin, nothing was restricting him from doing whatever he wanted. After all, what use was there talking about the concept of nobility?</p>
<p>Kim Suho thought this as his hands trembled. And, in the end, he pounced on Jin Sahyuk, cursing for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>Their scuffle continued for a long time. The two of them ran out of the cave at one point and eventually reached a dead-end.</p>
<p>A frightening cliff was awaiting them. However, the two entangled children failed to notice it.</p>
<p>Just like that, they fell from the cliff.</p>
<p>Who killed who in this instance? Did Kim Suho kill Jin Sahyuk? Or did Jin Sahyuk kill Kim Suho?</p>
<p>Well, since they both went through reincarnation, it didn't really matter.</p>
<p>But Kim Suho had to wonder as he fell to his death.</p>
<p>Why did he have to feel such pain?</p>
<p>Why was there nothing but pain and despair in this world?</p>
<p>And why did Jin Sahyuk confess her sins at the end? Wouldn't it have been better for both of them if she kept quiet and died peacefully?</p>
<p>Kim Suho had no way of finding out, but in reality, the answer was simple. The truth was so surprisingly simple that it made one chuckle. And Kim Suho had found out today.</p>
<p>The reason was that… this world was a mere 'novel' created by a damned author….</p>
<p>…This information, this mysterious narration, entered his brain. The voice was too insidious to be a fairytale, but the subdued emptiness was too frightening to be a documentary.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Kim Suho slowly opened his eyes. <em>Tadak, tadak—</em> He could hear the sound of something crackling.</p>
<p>"Auuk—"</p>
<p>Kim Suho got up with a groan, and only then was he was able to look around his surroundings.</p>
<p>"Ah."</p>
<p>A short mutter escaped his mouth.</p>
<p>Everything had been destroyed. The ground burned instead of the campfire, and a fog carrying a scent of death filled the air. The nature created by Chae Joochul had sunk and turned into a swamp of demonic energy, and countless Heroes were collapsed on the ground either dead or unconscious.</p>
<p>With a single breath, Baal had materialized the word 'destruction' in this space.</p>
<p>—You've woken up.</p>
<p>A voice resounded in the barrier. Kim Suho looked up and saw the true body of Baal looking down on him.</p>
<p>A black dragon.</p>
<p>That's how Kim Suho would describe him. The feeling he got when he first saw him wasn't wrong. That was the Black Dragon, often referred to as the Harbinger of Destruction in legends and myths.</p>
<p>Baal's reptilian mouth moved.</p>
<p>—I've received your memories. How painful. You must have received mine too, no?</p>
<p>Kim Suho fell silent. Just like Baal said, a few pieces of memories had flowed into this brain and taken place naturally.</p>
<p>—Transmigrator Hero.</p>
<p>Hearing this voice, Kim Suho's shoulders flinched. His response was almost instinctive. Kim Suho knew what those two words were referring to.</p>
<p>—For what purpose was that title created?</p>
<p>Baal's form suddenly grew small. His giant, draconic body quickly became as big as a puppy.</p>
<p>Now looking like a cute lizard, Baal walked up to Kim Suho.</p>
<p>—'Main Character', if you know the answer, I want to ask you.</p>
<p>The lizard made a joking expression.</p>
<p>—Are you disappointed? Are you angry? Or are you confused?</p>
<p>Kim Suho's mouth remained shut.</p>
<p>—Main Character, you should already know who the author of this world is.</p>
<p>Kim Suho didn't know, but he found out.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>Information about Kim Hajin poured into his brain. Kim Hajin was Kim Suho's creator. He mapped out Kim Suho's character, wrote everything about his life, and used his misfortunes, happiness, and growth for other people's satisfaction.</p>
<p>The existence named 'Kim Suho' had been created for others' enjoyment.</p>
<p>—Don't tell me you think this is okay? That you can continue to live in this world even if it is a mere novel. Such foolishness will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Kim Suho remembered how Kim Hajin was unreasonably kind when he treated him. Kim Suho thought it was due to friendship, but now he understood the real reason.</p>
<p>—Unfortunately, that is not true. Why? Because if I die, the task of the author will come to an end.</p>
<p>Kim Suho stared at Baal, who was chattering in front of him.</p>
<p>—This is the final arc, Kim Suho, the final arc! When the curtain closes to the final arc, this world will come to an end. Everything will stop for eternity.</p>
<p>Baal spoke with a grin.</p>
<p>The final arc. In other words, the conclusion.</p>
<p>A novel would end when it reached its conclusion. No matter how curious the readers were of the after story, the world inside the novel wouldn't continue on.</p>
<p>—But Main Character, I know how to save this world. A method to let this world continue living…. You should know it now too.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>When Kim Suho didn't answer, Ball pointed at Kim Suho's hip.</p>
<p>—That method lies in your sword.</p>
<p>The god-slaying sword, Misteltein.</p>
<p>Baal suggested that Kim Suho point this world at someone else.</p>
<p>—Entrap the author's soul in this world forever. This world will stop if the author leaves, but it will be a different story if his soul stays. I will split his soul into pieces and scatter them throughout the world. That way, a natural world full of life will continue to exist. The world will not stop and move eternally.</p>
<p>The core forming the world. Baal thought that this was Kim Hajin's soul. And most likely, it was true.</p>
<p>—Kim Suho, you can become the sword that slays the god. For the sake of this world, play the role of killing its god. If 'he' dies, we will become complete existences. I will gladly accept you as my equal and bring eternal richness and fertility to your world. Wouldn't that be the true method of protecting and saving this world?</p>
<p>Baal's long speech ended. He took a few steps back and stared at Kim Suho while floating around in the air.</p>
<p>Kim Suho didn't say a word. He stared at Baal without a hint of emotion on his face. Just like that, a long yet short time passed by.</p>
<p>—…And your answer?</p>
<p>Baal wanted to know what Kim Suho was thinking. However, even Baal couldn't read Kim Suho's thoughts. He guessed that this was because Kim Suho was the main character.</p>
<p>As such, Baal waited for Kim Suho's response. Of course, he didn't care if Kim Suho didn't agree right away.</p>
<p>His barrier was still trapping the so-called Creator. As long as the Creator was in this barrier and not his world, Baal felt like he could kill him.</p>
<p>So if Kim Suho refused, he planned to end everything here. It was just that convincing Kim Suho was a surer method of doing so.</p>
<p>…However, what Kim Suho was thinking was completely different than Baal's. No, perhaps they were similar.</p>
<p>Kim Suho had a simple desire of wanting to cut Baal's twisted eyes.</p>
<p>"Haa…."</p>
<p>Kim Suho took a deep breath and shook off this desire. He remembered the past that he experienced in the form of a dream.</p>
<p>—You! Let me go! I am your king! You dare….</p>
<p>—Shut up! You beggar!</p>
<p>—W-What? Beggar!? I saved you when you were a beggar, yet you dare to say this!?</p>
<p>Two children were arguing loudly.</p>
<p>Kim Suho had failed to protect Puharen and killed Prihi with his own hands. His final memories were of him becoming tainted.</p>
<p>However, he finally gained the chance to atone for his past sins.</p>
<p>He didn't want to fail again at protecting what he cherished.</p>
<p>He still remembered the day over 20 years ago when he was born on Earth as a baby. He didn't have parents in his previous life, but the parents in his current life gave him the name 'Suho'.</p>
<p>Suho, meaning, to protect. He felt as if fate was playing a trick on him. Regardless, he didn't want to become a Hero. He simply couldn't see himself as one when he had murdered the very person he swore to protect.</p>
<p>But as time passed, he felt the invisible hand of fate constrict him. That feeling intensified every time he saw, touched, or swung a sword.</p>
<p>The existence known as Kim Suho carried a clear, noble 'will of the sword'.</p>
<p>Growing up, he came to realize something.</p>
<p>That perhaps, this fate began from his name.</p>
<p>He heard the answer to his suspicion on TV from a well-respected Hero named 'Shin Myungchul'.</p>
<p>Shin Myungchul stood in front of a group of boys and girls who would become Heroes in the future and gave a speech Kim Suho could never forget.</p>
<p>—Everyone, do not forget. A Gift isn't a special right, but a duty. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>When Kim Suho heard these words, he chose the path he wanted to take. In a way, it was quite obvious. After all, it was unlikely that he reincarnated in this world for no reason.</p>
<p>He didn't think he was 'chosen'.</p>
<p>He didn't think he had to become the savior either.</p>
<p>It was just that… he thought it was his duty… to protect.</p>
<p>The meaning behind protecting wasn't so complex. Protecting someone's family, protecting someone's friends, and protecting oneself…. That was all.</p>
<p>"…Baal."</p>
<p>Today, the intent he had carried from that day was ascertained by Baal.</p>
<p>From the start— he had been born to 'protect everyone'.</p>
<p>—How disappointing.</p>
<p>The moment Kim Suho said his name, Baal realized what decision he made.</p>
<p>Baal emitted demonic energy, which was dense and powerful enough to melt a human soul instantly.</p>
<p>However, Kim Suho severed it in half just by swinging his sword once. No, perhaps he didn't even take his sword out.</p>
<p>—…!</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, Baal shot back and transformed back into his dragon form.</p>
<p>But to Kim Suho, his transformation looked like a pufferfish puffing its body in fright.</p>
<p>To be frank— he pitied him.</p>
<p>"Thanks. I found out thanks to you."</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled gently.</p>
<p>Even if what Baal said was true, or in other words, even if this world was a part of a novel, it didn't matter. Even if he was created by another being, he just had to be thankful of what he had and continue to live.</p>
<p>Moreover, he trusted that Kim Hajin wouldn't abandon this world.</p>
<p>"I… have to defeat you."</p>
<p>Although he was speaking calmly, he was boiling with rage on the inside. Around him were corpses of countless Heroes or those who were barely breathing.</p>
<p>Kim Suho's fury had surpassed his limit, and that made him calmer instead.</p>
<p>"That way, I can protect this world."</p>
<p>To actualize his previous thought - to cut Baal's twisted eyes - he swung his sword. Baal made something similar to a smile.</p>
<p>—You just made the worst possible deci….</p>
<p>Baal couldn't finish his sentence. Baal was waiting for Kim Suho to attack, but when Kim Suho swung his sword through the air— Baal lost his eye.</p>
<p>—Ah?</p>
<p>Rather than pain or rage, he felt doubt.</p>
<p>Why? And how?</p>
<p>"A novel or not, this world isn't something you can destroy as you please. There are people I need to protect. And as long as I can protect them, that's enough for me."</p>
<p>—…You insufferable mortal!</p>
<p>His rage arrived late. Baal shouted in anger and shot his demonic energy forward. Even now, Baal didn't think it was possible for him to lose.</p>
<p>He had an infinite amount of demonic energy in his barrier. As long as he waited until Kim Suho ran out of magic power, he believed he could win.</p>
<p>However….</p>
<p>"Too light."</p>
<p>Kim Suho cut Baal's demonic energy too easily. He didn't even need to use his sword. With a single wave of his hand, he erased Baal's demonic energy.</p>
<p>——!</p>
<p>Baal roared and increased the amount and intensity of his demonic energy. A storm of demonic energy brewed in the air.</p>
<p>A terrifying, great power of destruction shot out. But even against a force capable of devouring a world….</p>
<p>"Compared to the weight of your existence, you are too light."</p>
<p>Kim Suho was relaxed.</p>
<p>—You…!</p>
<p><em>He's looking down on me!</em></p>
<p><em>A mere mortal is looking down on me!</em></p>
<p><em>That cannot be tolerated. That MUST not be allowed.</em></p>
<p><em>How can a mere human threaten me…!?</em></p>
<p>For the first time, Baal felt resentment.</p>
<p>"Let me ask."</p>
<p>Kim Suho slowly approached Baal.</p>
<p>Baal backed off, matching Kim Suho's steps.</p>
<p>"Were you created to live so pitifully?"</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>At that moment, Baal stopped emitting his demonic energy. Kim Suho's arrogance had stepped over a line that turned his fury into calmness.</p>
<p>Baal made his emotions cold and thought how Kim Suho suddenly reached 'Transcendence'.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>"Wait, wait."</p>
<p>A cheerful voice rang out.</p>
<p>"I'm here too, Kim Suho~!"</p>
<p>Chae Nayun called Kim Suho while shaking Balmung in one hand.</p>
<p>Kim Suho stared at her with a look of surprise.</p>
<p>However, that wasn't the only thing to surprise him.</p>
<p>"Keuuu—"</p>
<p>A pain-filled stretching sound rang out. A Hero stood up from the ruined scenery of nature. It was the Hero with his body covered in steel - the Nine Stars' Heynckes.</p>
<p>"Ah, you were alive, as I thought! Oh! My disciple is here too!"</p>
<p>Heynckes exclaimed as he looked back and forth between Kim Suho and Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Soon afterward, Chae Joochul got up without a sound. He straightened out his bent back and neck, then cusped his hands behind his back. Although his traditional uniform was tattered, his skin underneath showed no signs of injury. His body was even more perfect than Kim Suho's, especially considering his age.</p>
<p>"Aigo, my head…."</p>
<p>Aileen was the next to get up. She furrowed her brows and pressed down on her temple. Because of the bags under her eyes, she looked like a caterpillar.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Earth, you saved me."</p>
<p>Rachel got up next. Earth's barrier had protected her body.</p>
<p>"Keeeu… Where has my honor as a leader gone?"</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah smiled as she looked at Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Kim Suho slowly turned around and stared at them.</p>
<p>They weren't the only ones awakening. Many Heroes were getting up one by one.</p>
<p>Although a vast majority were still collapsed unconscious, the Heroes had not lost to Baal yet.</p>
<p>In other words- there was no reason for Kim Suho to fight alone.</p>
<p>"Why the hell is he so strong?"</p>
<p>"Ah… damn it. I'm out of magic power."</p>
<p>"Hey, Kim Suho, are you alright?"</p>
<p>Hearing the voices of several Heroes, Kim Suho smiled faintly. They approached him one by one.</p>
<p>Soon, Kim Suho was surrounded by dozens of Heroes, and they stood together to gaze at Baal. Their will and fighting spirit had not been destroyed in the slightest.</p>
<p>—…..</p>
<p>On the other hand, Baal chuckled as he stared at the ant-like Heroes. An unappeasable fury welled up in his heart. This rage had to be bigger than the combined rage of all others in this world.</p>
<p>…Next, Baal's eyes contorted.</p>
<p>Kim Suho took out the holy sword containing his will.</p>
<p>The human and devil began their final fight, thinking of two different conclusions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 362. Ending (1)</p>
<p>[Morax and Jin Sahyuk's Story] </p>
<p><em>Jiing—</em> Hearing this vibration, Jin Sahyuk shook her head. Demonic energy exploded from an unknown place and burned the surface of her skin. Jin Sahyuk purified the demonic energy with a simple use of Reality Manipulation. The demonic energy turned blue before dissipating into the air. </p>
<p>"Are you okay?" A somewhat arrogant voice rang out. Jin Sahyuk turned to that direction. Shin Jonghak was looking at her with his spear in his hand. He seemed to have been unaffected by the demonic energy explosion. </p>
<p>"…." Jin Sahyuk got up silently. She then checked on Morax. The devil was full of slash marks. He was missing most of his fingers, and black blood was covering his giant body. A human would have died by now, but Morax was without a doubt alive.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>"Interesting." </p>
<p>A voice that was neither Shin Jonghak's nor Jin Sahyuk's resounded in the barrier. Shin Jonghak grabbed his spear, while Jin Sahyuk tied her disheveled, lightly-burnt hair into a ponytail.</p>
<p>"These beings called devils are truly interesting. Not as much as humans, of course, but interesting indeed." </p>
<p>The Monster King Orden murmured as he looked up at Morax. His eyes flickered with curiosity, and Jin Sahyuk couldn't help but find this sight shocking. </p>
<p>"Did he go crazy after reviving?" </p>
<p>The bastard had appeared out of nowhere and was simply staring at Morax. Without doing anything, it stood fixed on the ground. He was 'observing' Morax, just as the word suggested. </p>
<p>Orden turned his head and faced Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>"Do you need help, human?" </p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk shrugged off Orden's gaze with a grin. </p>
<p>"You can help by screwing off." </p>
<p>Kurukuru, who was standing next to Orden, flapped its wings in response. It seemed to be threatening Jin Sahyuk, saying, 'How dare you—' </p>
<p>Orden suppressed Kurukuru and replied dryly. </p>
<p>"It's too interesting a sight to just pass by, no?"</p>
<p>"…I didn't know you talked so much." </p>
<p>Just like how Orden found the situation interesting, Jin Sahyuk was interested in Orden's change. His body was a lot smaller than it was in the past, and humor seemed to take place of the weight that was lost. </p>
<p><em>Whoosh—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, Shin Jonghak's spear flew through the sky. He muttered as he glared at Jin Sahyuk with a displeased look.</p>
<p>"Orden doesn't seem to be an ally or a foe. Just focus on the devil, Jin Sahyuk."</p>
<p>At the same time, Morax began to move once again. He let out an odd screech and swung his arm, and Shin Jonghak swung his spear and pushed him away. </p>
<p>Black light flickered from the tip of his spear. This light of darkness was hard to explain in theory, but in any case, it was the power that belonged to Shin Myungchul, which Shin Jonghak had now succeeded.</p>
<p>"…Hmm."</p>
<p>With this, Jin Sahyuk saw their chance of winning was high. However, Jin Sahyuk didn't want to kill Morax yet. </p>
<p><em>Whooosh—</em></p>
<p>Morax punched out, but Shin Jonghak struck back with his spear. That wasn't all. The black light imbued in the spear traveled through Morax's fist and bound his entire body. </p>
<p>Light of darkness that burned and purified everything.</p>
<p>This black light, which Shin Myungchul acquired by atoning for his sins, was not perfect by any means. However, it boasted an undeniable advantage against one type of opponent.</p>
<p>With this power, Shin Jonghak became the perfect natural enemy of demons. After all, the black light had the power to 'purify demonic energy'. </p>
<p>"Oi, hold down that guy's body. Don't burn everything." </p>
<p>However, Jin Sahyuk didn't want to kill Morax yet. She jumped up lightly.</p>
<p>"What? Wait, where are you going, dumbass?"</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak shouted, but Jin Sahyuk didn't answer. She slowly flew up and landed on Morax's shoulder. The skin on Morax's shoulder was quite a disgusting mess. Morax knew his large body was both its advantage and disadvantage. To overcome this flaw, he had transformed the surface of his skin into a scorching swamp of demonic energy. </p>
<p>Thus, when Jin Sahyuk's shoes touched Morax's shoulder, they melted in an instant. However, Jin Sahyuk's feet were fine. She had already used Reality Manipulation to change the properties of her feet. Although she wouldn't be able to last long, she should be fine for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"…Wait for me, Puharen." </p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered as she glared at Morax's giant eyes. Then, she drew a deep breath. She looked like a diver preparing to jump, and what she did afterward was exactly that. </p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk swam through the demonic energy swamp trying to cuff her in… and jumped into Morax's pupils. </p>
<p>Just like what she did to Shin Jonghak, she was entering Morax's deep consciousness. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p>[Evandel's Cabin]</p>
<p>—Crevon's army is supposedly sweeping through all regions of Earth. After setting off from the Steppes of Manchu two days ago, the Crevon Army stretched out to the west and east, defeating the demons' armies. That's not all. In Paris, Grand Magician Oh Jaejin, 9-star Magician Ah Hae-In, and her disciple 'Evandel'….</p>
<p>On the other hand, Evandel was watching TV in her cabin. Public broadcast had been cut off with Baal's descent and was only restored today. Many broadcasters were reporting hopeful news all over the world.</p>
<p>Evandel calmed herself as she listened to these reports. </p>
<p>—Astaroth, the demon of the west, has been defeated by the combined efforts of Grand Magician Oh Jaejin and Grand Magician Ah Hae-In. The east side's Valac has been pushed back by the German government and Crevon's Hwarangs. </p>
<p>At first, Evandel was scared of this war. But after watching numerous Heroes fight while risking their lives, she learned something new. Their sacrifice and commitment taught her an important lesson. </p>
<p>In this world, many people fought to protect the world. To protect the animals, to protect the land, and to protect people, they stood back up no matter how many times they fell and didn't give up no matter how frightened they were. </p>
<p>Even though they should be afraid as well, they were overcoming their fears.</p>
<p>So, starting from today, Evandel decided to admire them. Not only that, she swore to follow in their footsteps. The weight behind the word 'Hero' increased in Evandel's heart, and she set a new goal for her future self. </p>
<p>—On the other hand, the less belligerent Leraje and Vassago have shown strange signs of protecting the citizens of their land. The World Government and the Hero Association have chosen not to antagonize them. </p>
<p><em>Ssk- ssk-</em> At that moment, a strange noise rang out. Evandel tilted her head at the faint sound and looked around the cabin room. </p>
<p>—Ah, we just received additional reports. The demon army that invaded Gaeseong has reportedly been annihilated by an unknown creature. Eye-witnesses described the mysterious creature as a black rabbit….</p>
<p><em>Ssk- ssk-</em> Evandel strained her ears and listened carefully. It was the sound of words being written. But where was it coming from? Curious, Evandel thought for a moment before suddenly realizing something and turning her head.</p>
<p>—Humanity's war against demons seems to be racing toward the victory line, but there is danger remaining. The Nine Evils who serve the devils are still alive and well, and the rank 1 devil, Baal, is currently at the border of the Korean Peninsula….</p>
<p><em>Ssk- ssk-</em> Characters were being written on the 'Communication Letter' she treasured. Evandel quickly sprinted to it and picked it up.</p>
<p>[Evandel, are you there?]</p>
<p>"Aaah!" </p>
<p>When she saw these four words, her eyes widened. Evandel swallowed hard and held the letter tightly.</p>
<p>[It's me, Hajin. Kim Hajin.] </p>
<p>She almost burst into tears the moment she saw the words. No, she teared up. <em>Huaaaang—</em> Evandel held the letter in her embrace while crying. Then, she looked down at the letter once again. </p>
<p>[Are you doing well?]</p>
<p>"Un! Un! Un!" </p>
<p>Evandel shouted before realizing her voice couldn't reach him. She only knew one way to reply to him. </p>
<p>She quickly began to jot down a reply. The pencil in her cute hands began to draw adorable characters….</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>[Un! I'm doing well! What about you, Hajin? Are you okay? I want to see you!] </p>
<p>Inside the stronghold Hirano Arashi constructed, I smiled as I read the words being transmitted to me by the Communication Letter. I felt like I could hear Evandel's voice through the text.</p>
<p>[I'm doing fine. Soon….]</p>
<p>I fell in thought in the middle of writing. </p>
<p>Would I be able to safely go back to Evandel's side?</p>
<p>"Haa…."</p>
<p>I planned to do everything in my power to tie the final knot. Even if I died in the process, I still had one chance to revive. </p>
<p>But even if revived….</p>
<p>[Everything's almost over, so be a good girl and listen to Master Ah Hae-In, okay?] </p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, I changed what I was going to say. Evandel replied immediately in the same cute, child-like tone she always had. </p>
<p>"What are you doing, laughing like that?" At that moment, Boss peeked her head up from the bottom of the ladder. I was on the second floor of the stronghold, while she was on the first. </p>
<p>After walking up to the second floor, Boss narrowed her eyes and glanced at the letter in my hand. I covered the letter with my hand and replied to Boss. </p>
<p>"Getting mentally ready for the war that's about to begin." </p>
<p>From the outside, I might look like I was fooling around. But in reality, I was keeping a close eye on Baal through the Thousand-Mile Eyes. Although it would probably be difficult to kill him in one attack, all I could do was sit here and wait for an opportunity. </p>
<p>"What about you, Boss? Are you done?" </p>
<p>"…Yeah." </p>
<p>Boss sat down next to me. Then, she muttered somewhat bitterly.</p>
<p>"I retrieved Yi Yeonjun's corpse. I plan on burying him in Pandemonium later."</p>
<p>"…Got it." </p>
<p>I bitterly smiled back and nodded my head. </p>
<p>Yi Yeonjun had done something horrible to Boss. He had destroyed the happy life she could have led. But I couldn't fault him for that in good conscience. </p>
<p>After all, I was the one who created Boss, and her past was only materialized around my writing. </p>
<p>"…If it weren't for him, I might have led a normal life." </p>
<p>Boss muttered as she looked out into the far distance. I wasn't sure if she knew what I was thinking about.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything. What she said wasn't true. Boss couldn't have led a normal life.</p>
<p>Because I created her. </p>
<p>"But…." </p>
<p>Boss glanced at my hand. Then, like a crawling caterpillar, her hand slowly moved toward it.</p>
<p>"…But… you know…."</p>
<p>But because her hand was moving at a speed of 1mm per second, I decided to act first and grabbed her hand. Boss flinched at first but soon smiled gently and said, "I was able to meet you because of it." </p>
<p>My heart jumped. I wondered if Boss could also hear the <em>Ba-Thump-</em> sound-effect. I raised my head in a daze and stared at Boss. She was doing the same. </p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>I felt a strange sensation welling up inside me. I couldn't tell whether it was sadness, gratitude, or love. </p>
<p>I also thought this.</p>
<p>Even if her past was created by my settings, the current reality was no longer a part of my novel. So maybe, it didn't matter. </p>
<p>Since I couldn't write about what would unfold in the future, and since I couldn't know about it and decide anything, perhaps I had finally been freed from the restraints of this world being a novel. </p>
<p>"Boss."</p>
<p>I squeezed her hand. </p>
<p>Setting all these thoughts aside, what I wanted to do now was clear. </p>
<p>I slowly leaned towards her. Boss didn't avoid me. In fact, she seemed to be waiting, as she slowly closed her eyes….</p>
<p>"We're all down here~" </p>
<p>Jain's voice suddenly cut in. Boss jumped in a fluster and pushed me away. Then, she shot a glance down. </p>
<p>"Hm~? What are you two doing up the… Aak!" </p>
<p>Boss threw a shadow rock at Jain before approaching me again. She then set the previous mood in a hurry.</p>
<p>"…Then, Hajin, what should I do from now on?"</p>
<p>Boss asked as she played with my hand. I knew what she was asking for, but I asked anyway. </p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Somewhat frustratedly, Boss returned to her usual self and spoke in a dry voice. </p>
<p>"I lived to fulfill Yi Yeonjun's wish in his place. Reforming the Chameleon Troupe, killing people and stealing items… they were all for him. But now…." </p>
<p>Boss stopped and suddenly closed her eyes. She didn't finish no matter how long I waited. </p>
<p>I smiled bitterly and pulled her towards me. Although we didn't kiss, the embrace was even softer. </p>
<p>"…It's fine."</p>
<p>I pointed at the members of the Chameleon Troupe who were waiting on the first floor. They were 'preparing' what I asked for along with Yoo Yeonha. </p>
<p>"You have <em>them</em>. If you don't have a goal, or if you don't have a purpose, you can look for it with your comrades. You <em>must</em>. This time, without killing people. So that you can be happy together…." </p>
<p>Although it might not be the best answer, it was the most ideal solution. A text-book answer or a cliche, if you will.</p>
<p>But Boss smiled even at my corny line. Looking into my eyes, with a delicate smile.</p>
<p>"…."</p>
<p>Seeing this smile and feeling my beating heart, I was convinced once again. </p>
<p>I wanted this woman to be happy. I wanted her to laugh. I… I loved everything about her….</p>
<p>And that's what saddened me more.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>With the battle against Baal about to break out in full, the atmosphere was tense. In this frozen-cold silence, a rather light word popped out.</p>
<p>"Grandfather." </p>
<p>It was Chae Nayun. Everyone, including Baal, turned to face her. Chae Nayun's expression was somewhat sinister. Chae Joochul stood apathetically for a moment as if he didn't know how to react. Then, he made a gentle smile as he had always done.</p>
<p>"…Grandfather." </p>
<p>But Chae Nayun wasn't smiling. She was glaring at Chae Joochul a bit resentfully.</p>
<p>"When this ends, we need to talk." </p>
<p>Her tone was laced with thorns. Chae Joochul didn't know why Chae Nayun was angry, but he nodded his head anyway.</p>
<p>"Baal."</p>
<p>Then, Kim Suho stepped forward.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Baal looked down at Kim Suho from above and thought about the youth's sudden transcendence and the barrier's effect on him.</p>
<p>However, Kim Suho didn't wait for him to finish his thoughts. </p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>Many Heroes roared out from their hearts. They ran toward Baal without a moment of hesitation. </p>
<p>Baal observed their moves with his narrowed, devilish eyes. </p>
<p>Heynckes's Steel Spirit cut his skin. Chae Joochul's storm dug into his eyes. Rachel's elementals and Aileen's Spirit Speech combined to form a dragon-like creature that bit down on his neck. Chae Nayun's sword shot to a gigantic size and slashed at his chest. </p>
<p>However, Baal didn't react. He knew any attempts to counter-attack would be nullified by Kim Suho's sword. He simply focused on calming his heart to avoid wasting any energy. </p>
<p>Even as he bled, Baal continued to think. Perhaps, he was desperate. Baal toiled like a human to find an answer. That in itself was humiliating enough, but thanks to it, he was able to arrive at a reasonable answer soon. </p>
<p>The root cause was him cutting off the world's deterrent force. So that he could descend, he had isolated the space inside the barrier from the world's deterrent force. That had also affected Kim Suho, allowing him to transcend. </p>
<p>This was only possible because Kim Suho was a Hero with an Authority and because he was the 'main character'. </p>
<p>—…. </p>
<p>Remaining silent amidst the barrage of attacks, Baal searched for only one person - Kim Hajin. </p>
<p>The foolish humans had refused the offer he made, but he was convinced that the world would end if Kim Hajin didn't die. And when that happened, he, Baal, would die as well. </p>
<p>—Where are you….</p>
<p>Baal couldn't find him. </p>
<p>Most likely, he wouldn't be able to find him for all eternity. This was because Kim Hajin was hiding in the barrier's crack. </p>
<p>—….Hah? </p>
<p>At that moment, Baal let out a short cry. <em>Chwaaaack—</em> He could hear something cutting his heart. A giant sword had invaded Baal's true body. </p>
<p>Baal stared at the sword piercing his skin, and the woman holding this sword. </p>
<p>"Uhahaha, how is it? Painful, right?" </p>
<p>A lowly human, a swordswoman named Chae Nayun, was looking at him with a smile. Baal's mind reeled from rage. </p>
<p>—…I admit. I cannot defeat you all. </p>
<p>Baal muttered with cold fury. Although this declaration was humiliating, he still had a method left.</p>
<p>—But did you forget?</p>
<p>If his barrier was setting the stage for Kim Suho, all he had to do was destroy it. Although he wouldn't be able to maintain his true body, Earth still had devils and demons under his rule. </p>
<p>Accepting their help wasn't a pleasant thing to do, but Baal knew he wasn't in a position to care about his pride. His subordinates would destroy Earth for him.</p>
<p>—I might die, but I am the god of evil who can never be annihilated.</p>
<p>Baal glared at Kim Suho's unshaking eyes and declared his intention to destroy the barrier. </p>
<p>An author of a novel might describe this move as 'self-destructing'. </p>
<p>Even Kim Suho's Authority shouldn't be able to interfere with him trying to detonate the barrier alongside everything within it.</p>
<p>Believing this, Baal destroyed his body. </p>
<p>…No.</p>
<p>He <em>tried</em> to destroy it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 363. Ending (2)</p>
<p>[Puharen’s Inner Mind]</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk slowly opened her eyes, but she was met with a darkness that made it no different. Puharen’s inner mind was dark. Coldness, emptiness, and loneliness…. Negative emotions weighing down the atmosphere constricted her feet.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk began to walk, relying only on her senses, to a place where a certain ‘presence’ was flickering.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>After walking endlessly for a while, Jin Sahyuk suddenly stopped. Her intuition told her that this was the place. The wavering of the soul was calling her.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk opened her palm, and a small source of light floated up. The light soon illuminated parts of the dark inner mind.</p>
<p>Just like that, Jin Sahyuk found him - her younger brother, squatting in the middle of the darkness, shaking.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Her breath halted. A thick, heavy ball of fire surged up from the bottom of her heart, and it seemed to burn up her entire body.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk swallowed the pain and looked down at Puharen. His thin, small body was colder than before, and his lifeless pupils were imbued with bottomless darkness.</p>
<p>He had not grown up in the slightest from his child state. Jin Sahyuk placed his frail appearance in her eyes so that it wouldn’t flow out; so that it wouldn’t escape.</p>
<p>“Puharen.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s voice couldn’t reach him as it scattered in the air. Puharen had been stuck in this dark place for dozens of years. Jin Sahyuk already knew that meeting him once would not change anything.</p>
<p>“Puharen.”</p>
<p>Still, she called his name. Puharen didn’t move. Jin Sahyuk bit down on her lips and fell in thought.</p>
<p><em>What were you doing here alone? Were you resenting me? Or were you looking for your mother, who left the world before you?</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk bent down to her knees and slowly reached out with her hand. Her trembling fingers touched Puharen’s face. A chilling coldness stung Jin Sahyuk’s heart, as though she were touching a corpse.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk called the child’s name once again.</p>
<p>“Puharen.”</p>
<p>And on this third attempt, Puharen’s inner mind shook. It was a small tremor, but it wasn’t caused by Puharen. An outside impact had shaken his inner mind. And if even his inner mind was being affected, it meant he didn’t have much time left.</p>
<p>She had to hurry.</p>
<p>For now, she had something she needed to do. She could seek ‘forgiveness’ later.</p>
<p>Still on her knees, Jin Sahyuk placed her hand on Puharen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“…I know I have no right to ask for forgiveness.”</p>
<p>Most likely, Puharen would never be able to forgive her, and she would never be able to atone for her sins.</p>
<p>So why? For some reason, Baal’s words suddenly popped up in her mind.</p>
<p>That this world was just a novel where everything was decided on beforehand. Those simple words.</p>
<p>That the reason she was like this and the reason Puahren became like this were all according to the settings created by ‘that man’….</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk laughed mockingly.</p>
<p>“But you know….”</p>
<p>No, Baal’s words were just a lame excuse. A way to pass on one’s fault to another in the form of resentment.</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk considered herself a ‘king’. And from what she had learned, a king did not make excuses. Funnily enough, Kim Hajin was the one who helped her achieve this realization. He had shattered her principles and reforged them as she begged for her life.</p>
<p>“There’s something I’ve always wanted to say to you.”</p>
<p>Magic power surged out from the hand that was touching Puharen’s shoulder. However, Puharen did not even try to see it. His dull eyes seemed to have already lost their ability to see.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spoke.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>With that, she released her magic power. The Authority of Reality Manipulation seeped into Puharen, and his shoulders faintly shook.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes and murmured calmly.</p>
<p>“Hurt me all you want inside my heart for all of eternity.”</p>
<p>Her magic power shot up like flames. After spreading to every corner of Puharen’s body, Jin Sahyuk’s magic power dismantled his body. Like a feathery speck of dust, or like a midsummer night’s flower petal, Puharen scattered away. Almost as if he didn’t exist in the first place.</p>
<p>With this- Jin Sahyuk killed Puharen for the second time.</p>
<p>But this time, it would be a slightly different death.</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk took in a deep breath. She sucked in the remnants of Puharen mixed in the air, and her body flashed with a blue light.</p>
<p>This was something Jin Sahyuk thought of on the spot when she saw Shin Myunchul meet Shin Jonghak. Morax had trapped Puharen’s soul in his body, and Shin Myungchul had lived on in Shin Jonghak’s inner mind. Who was to say she couldn’t do the same?</p>
<p>No, she was confident she would succeed.</p>
<p><em>I am a king who’s above a devil.</em></p>
<p><em>As a king, I will embrace Puharen. This place is too desolate. I don’t know if my heart will be any warmer, but I cannot let you be imprisoned here. Since I’m the one who made you fall into this place, I should be the one to take you out.</em></p>
<p><em>You can bother me all you want by letting your soul cry out. Even if you cut my heart until I’m close to dying, I will not complain.</em></p>
<p>“…Let’s go. Together.”</p>
<p>Of course, this was a one-sided abduction that didn’t ask for Puharen’s approval.</p>
<p>So, Jin Sahyuk used a Jin Sahyuk-like approach.</p>
<p><em>Tzzzt….</em></p>
<p>Puharen let out a small fricative sound as he seeped into Jin Sahyuk’s heart. Immediately, Jin Sahyuk’s body became overloaded. Puharen’s soul clashed with hers, the pain from which was difficult to endure for a human.</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk held on. Even as she coughed out one mouthful of blood after the other, she endured the heart-wrenching pain.</p>
<p><em>Koong-!</em></p>
<p>When Puharen’s soul reached the Jin Sahyuk’s heart, a thud rang out from the outside. Jin Sahyuk sensed that this impact was far more stable than the last.</p>
<p>She could also smell a familiar scent.</p>
<p>‘That man’ had finally stepped in.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes, feeling relieved.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa….</em></p>
<p>Soon, Morax began to crumble. He couldn’t maintain his form now that his host’s soul disappeared.</p>
<p>As he scattered away into dust-like particles, Jin Sahyuk felt Puharen’s emotions. Uncontrollable pain, resentment, and sorrow… accepting them all with her body, Jin Sahyuk made a thin smile.</p>
<p>Although she couldn’t put any adjectives to this smile, at the very least, she believed it looked like a king’s. If her scribe were here, he would surely give it a dignifying name like a King’s Smile.</p>
<p>Thinking such unimportant things, she lost consciousness.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The barrier was slowly contracting. The sky became narrower, and the earth crumbled down. Seeing this, the Heroes in the area could easily tell what Baal was planning. Thus, the battle became even more intense.</p>
<p>Steel Spirit and Spirit Speech. The magic sword and elementals. Swordsmanship and punches. The Heroes gathered here poured out everything they had.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul created undulations of nature and created explosions inside Baal, and Heynckes sliced off Baal’s skin. Chae Nayun raised her magic sword to push the falling sky up and support it.</p>
<p>“Don’t come down… damned ceiling! Uaaaah-! Kkuaaaaaa-!”</p>
<p>…What she was doing might look funny, but it served an important purpose.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s magic sword was delaying the contraction of the barrier. This was something only Chae Nayun could, as her magic power capacity had surpassed the level of humans.</p>
<p>“—Huup!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho swung Misteltein. He wanted to cut Baal’s ‘action’ itself. However, it wasn’t so easy. Kim Suho cut off his arm, skinned him, and even tore off his wings, yet it was impossible to destroy his will.</p>
<p>Eventually, Kim Suho thought about cutting the barrier before Baal. But even that was impossible.</p>
<p>This barrier was a form of protection from the world’s interference. In other words, this barrier was what granted him his current Transcendent state. Because of this, Kim Suho’s Authority could not destroy the barrier.</p>
<p>—It’s futile.</p>
<p>Baal knew this too. Baal seemed to have reined in his rage as he muttered with a tone of ridicule. All the meanwhile, the destruction of the barrier continued.</p>
<p>Soon, the barrier would contract completely and, unable to bear the compressed density and pressure, explode. Not even Baal would be able to survive from this total destruction.</p>
<p>Although the Heroes inside the barrier would die, Baal was different. As death was different from ‘annihilation’, Baal would be able to return to Earth one day. His death would only be temporary, and Earth would be unable to escape destruction.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Baal had created a game where his victory was guaranteed.</p>
<p>—It’s your loss.</p>
<p>Baal made a sinister smile. Then, he twisted his hand. The sky inside the barrier began to crumble down even quicker.</p>
<p><em>Kwagwagwagwa….</em></p>
<p>As the thunderous sounds of destruction rang out, Baal saw signs of despair from the Heroes’ eyes. He grinned. Sinister ecstasy welled up inside the evil god’s heart.</p>
<p>…It was then. A mysterious voice rang out from the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Futile? Says who?”</p>
<p>This somewhat dry voice immediately drew the attention of everyone present.</p>
<p>The Heroes were confused, but Baal’s eyes widened in shock. He turned to the direction the voice came from.</p>
<p>“You’re wide open right now because of all the attacks you received. Without your outer skin, you should be weaker to outside damage, right?”</p>
<p>Only then did Baal look down at his body. Demonic energy was leaking out of the numerous cuts and cracks on his skin. He belatedly roused his demonic energy to form a barrier.</p>
<p>However, Kim Suho instantly nullified it.</p>
<p>—Y-You… until the end…!</p>
<p>Just as Baal raged at Kim Suho-</p>
<p>“Let’s see if you can take this. It’ll be a bit different.”</p>
<p><em>BOOM-!</em></p>
<p>A thunderous boom shook the barrier. Kim Suho, Chae Nayun, Rachel, Yun Seung-Ah, Heynckes, Chae Joochul, Baal and Bell…. All of them stared right at it — a bullet flying forward while drawing a white rift in space.</p>
<p>The bullet emitting a brilliant light drew a straight line in the air before digging into Baal’s heart.</p>
<p><em>Pzzzt-!</em></p>
<p>—…!</p>
<p>The moment the bullet reached Baal’s heart, his eyes widened. Then, the contraction of the barrier stopped. The force of the shock had cut off Baal’s will from the barrier.</p>
<p>—Kuuuu… KUAAAAAAK-!</p>
<p>Baal coughed out a mouthful of blood. Reddish-black liquid flowed down from the dragon’s mouth.</p>
<p>Even as he writhed in pain, Baal refused to believe it. A bullet with ‘deterrent force’. Such a thing couldn’t exist. It couldn’t….</p>
<p>——!</p>
<p>Baal roared. He pinpointed the location of the shooter using the direction the bullet came from, and his eyes captured ‘that man’.</p>
<p>That damned man was right there.</p>
<p>That arrogant, lazy man was aiming his gun at him.</p>
<p>Baal opened his mouth and breathed out demonic energy that was mixed with blood.</p>
<p>The breath filled with killing intent followed the same path the bullet traveled, but….</p>
<p>“…Good try.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho cut it into nothingness once again. Kim Suho smiled as he stared at Baal.</p>
<p>Baal also stopped the rage he was spitting out and looked down at Kim Suho contemptibly.</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Next, a thick silence descended.</p>
<p>The Hero and Baal only glared at each other. Was it disgust, resentment, or resignation? Unknown feelings flickered in their eyes.</p>
<p>The cold silence didn’t last long.</p>
<p>Soon, Baal let out a hollow chuckle.</p>
<p>—Real cheeky… so much so that I want to destroy everything….</p>
<p>Kim Suho didn’t let Baal continue any further. It was his ironclad rule to never let his guard down.</p>
<p>“—!”</p>
<p>Kim Suho let out a spirited shout and swung his sword.</p>
<p>Seeing Kim Suho’s all-out attack, many other Heroes did the same.</p>
<p>Baal simply watched.</p>
<p>“Break—!”</p>
<p>Aileen’s short, full-power Spirit Speech; Chae Nayun’s greatsword emanating a terrifying amount of magic power; Heynckes’s sharp Steel Spirit; Chae Joochul’s emotionless nature.</p>
<p>Rachel’s purification activating using the Fairy Sword Galatine and her elementals; Yun Seung-Ah’s white Flower Sword blooming in all directions; Shimurin’s grand magic shaking the earth.</p>
<p>Harin’s exorcism spell activating which could even penetrate Baal; Yoo Jinwoong’s crimson electricity flowing through the air; Yoo Sihyuk’s wolves leaping toward Baal’s neck; Yi Yongha’s inextinguishable flames….</p>
<p>Everything enriched the brilliance of the Sword Saint’s sword strike.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 364. Ending (3)</p>
<p>[Baal’s Barrier]</p>
<p>I changed the Desert Eagle into its sniper rifle form. With the rigid sound of machinery, the handgun expanded in size. The barrel fused with Aether and extended forward frighteningly, and the muzzle accurately captured the existence in the far distance.</p>
<p>Baal was still there. I thought about which area to snipe at every moment - the heart, the head, the eyes…. None of these looked like weak points. After all, not even the god-slaying bullet could pierce through Baal’s defense easily.</p>
<p>The problem was the strength of the bullet and Baal’s outer skin. The destructive power of the god-slaying bullet wasn’t all that special. It couldn’t cut everything like Kim Suho, it could not push forward with sheer force like Chae Nayun’s terrifying magic power, and it couldn’t distort reality like Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Although it could deal critical damage to a devil that reached divinity, it would have to pierce the devil’s ‘outer skin’ first. However, the god-slaying bullet lacked the power to do so.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I was mulling over my options, but I soon realized that was unnecessary.</p>
<p>—!</p>
<p>Baal was focused on self-destructing through destroying his barrier. Because of it, he wasn’t paying attention to the Heroes’ attacks, so as the battle continued, his outer skin was being torn apart little by little.</p>
<p>Demonic energy trickled down like sand from the cracks created by his torn skin.</p>
<p>Although the contraction of the barrier hastened because of this sacrifice, it didn’t matter to me.</p>
<p><em>Click—</em></p>
<p>I loaded the god-slaying bullet into the gun’s chamber. Then, I roused Stigma’s magic power to the limit. Pouring out every ounce of Stigma I had left, I used Overclocking to add in even more.</p>
<p>It wasn’t an easy process.</p>
<p>For a moment, I felt like my soul was getting sucked out, like the rampaging Stigma was grabbing onto my mind and shaking it crazily.</p>
<p>That was, until someone touched my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hajin.”</p>
<p>The voice grabbed my consciousness right as it was on the verge of scattering. A gentle touch embraced my cheeks. I could see Boss’s face. She was staring at me with a warm gaze.</p>
<p>“…Thanks.”</p>
<p>I snapped out of my daze thanks to her.</p>
<p>I slowly took her fingers off, then locked my finger on the trigger again.</p>
<p>“Boss… I hope you didn’t forget… but you remember my Unique skill right?”</p>
<p>With Stigma’s immense pressure pressing down on me, I could barely speak. But I still forced myself to eke out some words.</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>“So even if it looks like I’m dead….”</p>
<p>I roused Stigma’s magic power once again. It blazed around me like wildfire. The overclocked magic power stole energy from my heart, and the extracted lifeforce seeped into the bullet.</p>
<p>“I won’t… really die.”</p>
<p>Boss smiled bitterly and nodded. At that moment, the ‘charging’ was completed. Any more would be impossible even if I risked something greater than my life, so if this didn’t work, that would be it.</p>
<p>[Stigma has been overclocked to 1353%.]</p>
<p>A system message popped up, notifying me that I expended an additional 13.5 streaks of Stigma. For some reason, this made me feel relieved.</p>
<p>I had put my all into this god-slaying bullet.</p>
<p>—It’s futile.</p>
<p>At that moment, Baal muttered arrogantly.</p>
<p>I gazed into Boss’s eyes one last time, then grinned as I faced the battlefield.</p>
<p>—It’s your loss.</p>
<p>Baal’s declaration of victory rang out. This was the best opportunity.</p>
<p>“Futile? Says who?”</p>
<p>I blurted out along with a mouthful of blood as my voice continued to be suppressed by Stigma’s magic power.</p>
<p>Immediately, Baal turned and looked at me. His eyes were truly terrifying. However, I wasn’t afraid. I was confident my bullet would pierce his heart and annihilate him.</p>
<p>“Let’s see if you can take this. It’ll be a bit different.”</p>
<p>I pulled the trigger as I gazed into Baal’s eyes.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>A huge explosion erupted, and a powerful shockwave shot outward as it shook the barrier. This was the first time I heard such a thunderous gunfire.</p>
<p>“…Uk!”</p>
<p>However, the immense destructive power came with a critical side-effect.</p>
<p>The god-slaying bullet broke the Desert Eagle’s muzzle, dismantling it as if it had been torn apart. The remnants of the Desert Eagle splattered on me. Some of them struck my body and tore it apart, but Boss blocked most of them.</p>
<p><em>Chwaaaa…..</em></p>
<p>The god-slaying bullet flew brilliantly after destroying the Desert Eagle.</p>
<p>I could see the beautiful, faint trail it left behind, but unfortunately, I would be unable to see the result.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>My body staggered. Several drops of saliva flew out of my mouth. Or perhaps, they were drops of blood.</p>
<p>My vision spun, so much so that I couldn’t follow the bullet I shot out, and my limbs escaped the realm of my control.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Boss, I would have collapsed embarrassingly.</p>
<p>—Hajin! Hajin!</p>
<p>Even though I told her I wouldn’t die, Boss was worried. But her agitated voice only faintly rang out before disappearing completely from my consciousness.</p>
<p>Despite Boss holding onto me, I felt like I was sinking into a bottomless pit. Someone was pulling me down. Someone I didn’t know was calling me.</p>
<p>As my consciousness faded away, blue words appeared in the darkness.</p>
<p>[The Final Arc…]</p>
<p>I could read the system message.</p>
<p>I was sinking endlessly to an unknown place. I had a strong hunch that when I woke up, a certain meeting would be awaiting me.</p>
<p>And in this unpleasant chaos, I lost consciousness.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>[Korean Border]</p>
<p>Baal’s territory disappeared completely and was replaced by an ordinary, green field. The sun was scattering clear light across the blue sky. The land mixed in green and yellow shone under the sunlight.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>It was a beautiful sight. Kim Suho exclaimed in awe as he began to wonder if he was dreaming. Lying down on the ground and looking at ‘true nature’, the previous battles all felt unrealistic.</p>
<p>“…Ah!”</p>
<p>But reality struck him rather soon. Kim Suho tried to get up, but his body didn’t move. He was drained of energy to the point where he couldn’t even move a finger.</p>
<p>Kim Suho managed to just barely tilt his head and look at his surroundings.</p>
<p>Then, he found Baal.</p>
<p>Baal was alive. And unlike him, he wasn’t lying on the ground disgracefully. Although he had a deep laceration cutting across his body, Baal was standing upright and glaring at him.</p>
<p>Kim Suho chuckled almost subconsciously.</p>
<p>“Did we lose?”</p>
<p>A weak thought surfaced on his mind, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>“Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>A somewhat familiar voice rang out. Only then did Kim Suho look beyond Baal.</p>
<p>First, he saw Crevon’s army filling the horizon. Lü Bu and Ki Parang, Lancelot and Kim Yusin and the Empress Araha… they were radiating with golden light that was brighter than the sun’s.</p>
<p>Next, he saw a giant castle and a ship floating in the sky. The former was Medea’s Magic Castle and the latter was the Genkelope Vessel.</p>
<p>And they weren’t the only ones in this field.</p>
<p>“…Over here.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s shoulders flinched as he turned over.</p>
<p>A truly incredible number of Heroes were standing there.</p>
<p>Essence of the Strait, Creator’s Sacred Grace, Desolate Moon, Frost Sanctuary…. Standing along with the executives of various guilds and the members of the Temple of Justice, Chae Nayun was smiling.</p>
<p>“Don’t you… ever get tired?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was a bit taken aback. How could Chae Nayun stand after pouring out so much magic power? She really had a ridiculous amount of stamina.</p>
<p>“Now isn’t the time to get tired!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun shook her head and reached out to Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Kim Suho grabbed her hand and got up. The duo then backed off.</p>
<p>Baal was watching this unfold with deeply sunken eyes. And in front of Baal, Chae Nayun raised her sword.</p>
<p>“It’s round two. Or wait, is it round three?”</p>
<p>Hearing what was clearly directed at him, Baal made a bitter smile.</p>
<p>He knew that his defeat was decided.</p>
<p>A bitter resignation filled his heart.</p>
<p>Pierced by the god-slaying bullet, his heartbeat was slowly decreasing.</p>
<p>He knew he didn’t have much time left. His heart would soon stop. But Baal didn’t know whether the ‘end’ that would follow afterward would be death or annihilation.</p>
<p>But for now, he just felt regretful.</p>
<p>If his defeat was decided by fate…</p>
<p>If this expedition was created so that he could never win…</p>
<p>If his existence really was ‘created to be defeated’….</p>
<p>“How regrettable.”</p>
<p>Then he would have liked to rampage a little more… to drive the humans to a corner by taking a more forceful approach.</p>
<p>Then maybe, he would have found a tiny possibility of victory, pushing the humans to the brink of despair.</p>
<p>“Baal.”</p>
<p>Baal heard someone call his name. His head turned around. There, he saw Bell, who looked just like him. He was looking at Baal pitifully.</p>
<p>Baal couldn’t help but lament his situation.</p>
<p>Not only did he fail to achieve his desire, but he was also being pitied by a human…</p>
<p>No, he refused to give up.</p>
<p>“Lower your head, Bell. My fight has yet to end.”</p>
<p>Baal snapped at his old friend and roused his demonic energy.</p>
<p>He still had enough energy to bring a few humans down with him. If he gave up without doing anything, that would be unfitting of the name ‘devil’.</p>
<p>“Baal—!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a roar rang out, arousing his fighting spirit. Baal turned to where the voice had come from. Shin Jonghak was standing on a hill not so far away.</p>
<p>Baal recognized him.</p>
<p>He was the grandson of Shin Myungchul, the human who made a contract with him and summoned him to this world.</p>
<p><em>Koong—</em></p>
<p>Seeing him, Baal’s heart faintly pulsed. He could feel Shin Myungchul’s soul from Shin Jonghak’s heart.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>To meet the human who summoned him to this place at this time. Was this also Fate’s mischief?</p>
<p>Baal quite enjoyed this one.</p>
<p>With a genuinely pleased smile, Baal gathered demonic energy in his hands.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak aimed the Conqueror Spear at Baal’s throat and shouted.</p>
<p>“I came to collect your head—!”</p>
<p>Why was he so noisy? Baal didn’t like how Shin Jonghak was acting like a fool, but he accepted it with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>No matter the case, a sweet and perilous battlefield was ahead of him. The end of his expedition was there. Because he bet his ‘heart’, it was chaotic. Because he realized his ‘origin’, it felt empty.</p>
<p>This was the fight where his life was on the line.</p>
<p>Defeat would mean both death and annihilation.</p>
<p>But even if he were to be defeated, even if his defeat was guaranteed, it was fine.</p>
<p>“Fine. I will come to you this time.”</p>
<p>To obtain the one thing he was never able to experience - ‘true death’ - Baal stepped forward.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>[Essence of the Strait, VIP Hospital]</p>
<p>Kim Suho slowly opened his eyes. Bright sunlight blurred his vision, followed by a gentle breeze that tickled his skin.</p>
<p>After enjoying nature for a brief moment, Kim Suho jumped and touched his stomach.</p>
<p>“Whew.”</p>
<p>A sigh of relief escaped his mouth.</p>
<p>It seemed he hadn’t died and woken up in the afterlife.</p>
<p>“You’re up?”</p>
<p>A familiar voice rang out. Kim Suho tilted his head and turned to the side.</p>
<p>“…Yoo Yeonha?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled faintly while nodding her head.</p>
<p>“Good. You recognize me. It wouldn’t have been surprising if you lost your memory with the injury you had.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho stared at her somewhat dazedly before raising his upper body. The area around his solar plexus hurt, but it wasn’t so unbearable that he couldn't sit up.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry about me. What happened to Baal?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked about this first. His final memories came back to him. He was cutting Baal’s demonic energy attacks one after the other, then due to the accumulated fatigue, a demonic energy spear had penetrated his stomach. That was it.</p>
<p>His memory ended there.</p>
<p>“Who knows?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha mischievously avoided the question.</p>
<p>Kim Suho became frustrated. The fact that Yoo Yeonha was here likely meant that the situation had been taken care of to a degree.</p>
<p>…Unable to hold back his curiosity, he grabbed the TV remote near the bed and turned on the news.</p>
<p>—With the annihilation of Baal, Earth is now in a critical crossroad.</p>
<p>This line immediately relieved him of his frustration.</p>
<p>Kim Suho breathed out a sigh of relief and asked Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“Baal… died?”</p>
<p>“Mm…. He disappeared. Along with Bell.”</p>
<p>But Yoo Yeonha’s answer was a little more vague.</p>
<p>Kim Suho furrowed his brows and asked back.</p>
<p>“…He disappeared?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. No one knows where he went. It looked like he was dead, but we have no way of confirming it. Bell suddenly ran out at the end of the battle and disappeared along with Baal.”</p>
<p>Bell and Baal. Kim Suho didn’t know how these two twins were related. But Yoo Yeonha seemed to know everything.</p>
<p>Next, Yoo Yeonha explained with a grin.</p>
<p>“I heard from Grand Magician Shimurin-nim.”</p>
<p>“What? Tell me too!”</p>
<p>—On the other hand, Orden has returned to Vladivostok. The citizens of Vladivostok have welcomed their guardian deity with open arms….</p>
<p>“W-What’s that? O-Orden?”</p>
<p>Things Kim Suho didn’t know about were being reported on TV. Kim Suho urged Yoo Yeonha for an explanation, but she only shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Why ask me? Aren’t you the one who let Orden go?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho flinched and shut his mouth. Indeed, he didn’t confirm whether Orden died or not. He even lied about it when the Hero Association asked him.</p>
<p>It was because he was reminded of Jin Sahyuk and himself when he looked at Orden and Kurukuru. Unlike his past self who tried to kill his master, Kurukuru had tried to save Orden, even while sacrificing his own life.</p>
<p>That was why he couldn’t bring himself to slash Orden with his sword.</p>
<p>Still, he remembered confirming that Orden’s breathing had stopped….</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Orden is our ally.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha suddenly projected a contact's information from her smartwatch. The name [Orden] was displayed in the open.</p>
<p>“Huh…? What’s this?”</p>
<p>“How is it? I bet I’m the first one to get Orden’s number.”</p>
<p>“Ha….”</p>
<p>Seeing how proud Yoo Yeonha was, Kim Suho wasn’t sure how to react.</p>
<p>“Anyways, do you want to come out? Nayun, Seung-Ah Unni, and everyone else is in the lobby.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and Yun Seung-Ah. When he heard these two names, a smile spread across his face.</p>
<p>Then, when he remembered a certain name, his expression stiffened.</p>
<p>“…What about Hajin?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t have to worry about him.”</p>
<p>“He’s here too?”</p>
<p>“No, he’s in a safer place.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin wasn’t in this hospital. But since he was with the Chameleon Troupe, he was in a much safer place. After all, that ‘Boss’ person seemed to like Kim Hajin more than anyone else.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho fell in thought. He was brooding about the memories Baal placed into him.</p>
<p>If Hajin really was ‘the author who created this world’, then how should he treat him from now on?</p>
<p>“Kim Suho?”</p>
<p>Startled, Kim Suho raised his head. Yoo Yeonha was staring at him suspiciously.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Ah.”</p>
<p>Well, now wasn’t the time to worry about that.</p>
<p>He could talk about this later when he met Hajin.</p>
<p>“Nothing. Um, let’s go out and see everyone else.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho got up while holding onto his stomach. Yoo Yeonha offered to help him, but he refused and stood up by himself.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he grew curious as to how he survived after receiving such a serious injury.</p>
<p>“Oh~ That? You know Yi Yuri, right?”</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>“The girl you saved a long time ago. You know, back at the museum.”</p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“She has the Authority of Healing. Without her, you would be dead.”</p>
<p>Yi Yuri. She was the girl he saved with Chae Nayun back when he was in Cube. He had heard that she was someone important, but to think she had the ‘Authority of Healing’….</p>
<p>“…I’ll have to go thank her later. Along with gifts, of course.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho opened the door with a grin.</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>Then, he became dazed.</p>
<p>He could see the hospital’s hallway when he opened the door. It was wide and inexplicably fancy.</p>
<p>The floor was covered in golden marble, chandeliers hung on the ceiling and lit the area, and many people were gathered around the circular couches and luxury chairs underneath the chandeliers.</p>
<p>“Oh, Kim Suho! Are you alright!?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun shouted after being the first one to see Kim Suho. She laughed out loud before holding up the child she had under her armpit and showing her to Kim Suho.</p>
<p>“Look! Isn’t she cute!? This is the kid Rachel gave birth to! Her name’s Evandel!”</p>
<p>“Aah, aah, aaaang….”</p>
<p>The child Chae Nayun introduced as Evandel struggled to escape from Chae Nayun’s hands, and Rachel had to step in and retrieve her.</p>
<p>Rachel embraced Evandel.</p>
<p>“Don’t raise her like that! Also, I didn’t <em>give birth</em> to Evandel. She….”</p>
<p>Rachel stopped in the middle of her speech. This was because Evandel was looking at her with moist eyes. It was true that Rachel didn’t give birth to her, but she felt like saying this again would hurt her feelings.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun made a mischievous smile and asked.</p>
<p>“…You didn’t? Then what?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Rachel let Evandel go on the other side of Chae Nayun. After finally escaping from the clutches of Chae Nayun, Evandel flew over to Yun Seung-Ah, who was the most gentle with patting her.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, there’s our hero!”</p>
<p>At that moment, an aged voice called Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Kim Suho could tell who it was before even turning around.</p>
<p>“So, how is your body?”</p>
<p>Heynckes raised his left hand and asked. His right hand had already turned to steel completely and was dyed grey. It was now impossible to restore his right arm.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. But your arm….”</p>
<p>“I’m fine too. At my age, it’s normal to lose control of one arm. Well, anyways, I’ll let you go. This old man needs more rest.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho said goodbye to Heynckes and sat down next to Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>There really were many Heroes in this lobby: Yoo Sihyuk, Ah Hae-In, Yoo Jinwoong, Yi Yongha, Aileen, Nicholas, Chae Nayun, Evandel, Yi Yeonghan…. There was so much talking that it was hard to listen, as the voices rang out in a cacophony.</p>
<p>“Argh, stop provoking me!”</p>
<p>Aileen suddenly shouted and pushed someone away.</p>
<p>“Ehem. What’s wrong with a master wanting to see her disciple’s injuries?”</p>
<p>This someone was none other than Ah Hae-In.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In grabbed Aileen’s head with a scowl. <em>Aah, aaaaaaaah-!</em> Aileen struggled with her arms, unable to bring herself to use her Spirit Speech.</p>
<p>“Suho?”</p>
<p>Next, a gentle voice sought out Kim Suho. It was Yun Seung-Ah. The girl named Evandel was in her embrace. Yun Seung-Ah held up Evandel’s hand and gave a little wave.</p>
<p>“Say hi. This is Evandel, a future 9-star Magician. And Evandel? This is Kim Suho. My guild’s second-in-command.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Hi, Evandel.”</p>
<p>“…Un, he, hello….”</p>
<p>Evandel seemed to be the shy type as she quickly hid behind Yun Seung-Ah. She looked just like a smaller version of Rachel and was incredibly adorable. Kim Suho smiled and tried to get a little closer.</p>
<p>“Evandel just gets cuter every time I see her~”</p>
<p>At that moment, Yoo Yeonha suddenly appeared and cut in. She pushed Kim Suho aside and skipped over to Evandel. However, Yun Seung-Ah narrowed her eyes and blocked Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>“You only met her today.”</p>
<p>“…But I saw her a long time ago.”</p>
<p>As Kim Suho was watching their power struggle with a chuckle… he could clearly hear the news report from the TV in the corner of the lobby.</p>
<p>—We will march forward. After enduring the great evil of Baal, humanity will….</p>
<p>Kim Suho paused and watched the TV.</p>
<p>—But before then, there is something I need to say. Something I need to correct.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak was on the screen. Standing on top of a podium, he declared loudly.</p>
<p>—As Shin Myungchul’s grandson and as this world’s Hero….</p>
<p>A smile emerged on Kim Suho’s face.</p>
<p>…At that moment.</p>
<p>Something brushed past Kim Suho’s temples.</p>
<p>For a split second, a strange, unpleasant ‘feeling’ touched him.</p>
<p>Because of it, he couldn’t hear Shin Jonghak’s speech. Rather than not being able to hear him, his introduction was too long. He was talking about the time he was three-years-old right now.</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t the problem.</p>
<p>Kim Suho was wrapped in a feeling that ‘something had changed’.</p>
<p>That ‘feeling’ just now seemed to have twisted the world somehow.</p>
<p>Although it bothered him, the sensation was too faint and fleeting for him to investigate any further. Without a choice, Kim Suho furrowed his brows and tried to sit down.</p>
<p>…However.</p>
<p>It seemed he wasn’t the only one who felt that sensation.</p>
<p>“W-What was that?”</p>
<p>“I, I don’t know….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun and Rachel tilted their heads in the middle of their quarrel.</p>
<p>It was the same for Evandel and Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Evandel stopped moving with her eyes widened like a robot with a dead battery, and Yoo Yeonha, who was rubbing her cheek against her, furrowed her brows and began to look around.</p>
<p>However, they seemed to be the only ones who noticed this sensation. Everyone else was acting normal, even though their senses weren’t any more dull.</p>
<p>Kim Suho faced the ones who ‘felt’ something. The first was Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“Hey, Chae Nayun, what just happened?”</p>
<p>They couldn’t figure out what changed. Perhaps, they would never find out.</p>
<p><em>Drrrrk—</em></p>
<p>The hospital door suddenly opened, and many people rushed in.</p>
<p>“Ah~ You guys were all here!”</p>
<p>It was Medea, Crevon’s Empress Araha and her generals. They smiled brightly and joined everyone.</p>
<p>“I, Empress Araha, have something to say to everyone.”</p>
<p>Saying this, Araha waited for the Heroes in the lobby to pay attention to her. After all, she was Crevon’s empress who provided great help to Earth.</p>
<p>“…Hello? Everyone?”</p>
<p>But they only paid attention to her for a moment. They quickly took their attention off of her and went back to talking.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 365. Decision</p>
<p>[Chameleon Troupe’s Sanctuary]</p>
<p>Boss gathered every member of the Chameleon Troupe to their sanctuary. The cave Kim Hajin modified in the past was still in excellent condition. Thanks to the Goblin Tablet’s goblin servants, the place was spotless and even looked better than before.</p>
<p>There, Boss made a simple announcement. Although the content of the announcement was grave, everyone took it lightly as they had expected it.</p>
<p>Boss had announced the disbanding of the Chameleon Troupe.</p>
<p>“…What are you going to do from now~?”</p>
<p>After a short disbanding ceremony, Jain approached Cheok Jungyeong, who was sitting on the couch and asked. Cheok Jungyeong glanced up at her before shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Considering the reason the Chameleon Troupe was formed, it only made sense to disband it now. Boss had formed the new Chameleon Troupe to avenge Yi Yeonjun, but now that the truth was revealed… well, everything had become quite a mess.</p>
<p>“Where’s Boss? And what is she doing?”</p>
<p>When Cheok Jungeong asked, Jain grinned and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Boss~? She’s not our boss anymore~ She’s our ‘club’ leader now~”</p>
<p>Jain projected a hologram with her smartwatch.</p>
<p>[Social Club - Colored Calves]</p>
<p>[Club Leader - Yi Byul]</p>
<p>[Club Member - 6]</p>
<p>“I’ll send you an invitation too~”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong gave a displeased glance. Still, he turned on his smartwatch and applied.</p>
<p>Jain continued talking as she grinned brightly.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, she buried Yi Yeonjun’s corpse in Pandemonium… and today, she said she’d atone for her sins for the rest of her life.”</p>
<p>“…Atone for her sins?”</p>
<p>“Yep. She apparently made a promise with Hajin.”</p>
<p>“Atone how?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know~ But Boss has enough wealth to feed a country~ Since there are many orphans right now, it’ll be perfect~”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong sighed quietly.</p>
<p>Atoning for one’s sins.</p>
<p>Was that something they could do? The sin of killing a thousand people couldn’t be washed away just because one saved a million others. The people they had to seek forgiveness from were already dead. And even if they came back to life, the only way to ask for their forgiveness would be to offer them their own heads.</p>
<p>“Why? You want to do it too~?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong replied immediately. It was so quick that Jain was taken aback slightly.</p>
<p>Then, Cheok Jungyeong stood up. <em>Koong-! Koong-!</em> Perhaps because he had just returned from killing the remnant demons, his huge, muscular body created inhuman rumbles as it moved.</p>
<p>“I’d rather have someone kill me for vengeance than do that. Well, I doubt anyone can kill me though.”</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>Jain smiled faintly.</p>
<p>In truth, she agreed with Cheok Jungyeong. Boss was probably the only one in the Chameleon Troupe who even considered ‘atoning for one’s sins’. Everyone else knew they had killed far too many people and committed far too many sins to turn back now.</p>
<p>“Well then, why don’t we go do our work~?”</p>
<p>“…Work?”</p>
<p>Jain made a suggestive smile.</p>
<p>When Cheok Jungyeong narrowed his eyes, Jain took out a thick envelope.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“Mm… probably the incident that Boss wants to make right~?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong snatched the envelope. The first page of the document inside the envelope had the words [Data Related to Kwang-Oh Incident] printed in huge letters. Cheok Jungyeong looked down at Jain without even reading the document.</p>
<p>“You know I don’t read. Explain.”</p>
<p>“Mn~ Well, it’s simple~ You know that there are secretly three Association Heads, right~?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong nodded his head. Although ‘Yi Yukho’ was the official Head of the Hero Association, there were also ‘Kim Sukho’ and ‘Yoo Jangwon’ working in the shadows. Kim Sukho was a former president of Korea, and Yoo Jangwon was a sly weasel who was a Master-rank Hero until his retirement.</p>
<p>“We’ll kill them all.”</p>
<p>“…All three of them?”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong widened his eyes and asked.</p>
<p>But as if it was too early to be surprised, Jain clapped her hands and continued.</p>
<p>“Yep, and also Chae Joochul and Yoo Jinwoong.”</p>
<p>“What—?! Chae Joochul and Yoo Jinwoong—?!”</p>
<p>“Yep~ Why~? Are you scared~?”</p>
<p>Jain licked her lips and provoked Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong stared into Jain’s eyes for a moment before smiling as expected. He then burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Uhahahaha—! Jain, I didn’t know you were so feisty—!”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong could practically feel his muscles heating up in excitement. He didn’t care too much about Kim Suho and Yi Yukho, but Chae Joochul and Yoo Jinwoong? He saw them as perfect opponents for someone of his skill.</p>
<p>“When are we starting? What’s the plan!?”</p>
<p>“We don’t need to do anything. Kim Sukho is looking for us. He’ll come to us eventually.”</p>
<p>“Uhaha, he’s looking for us? Really—!?”</p>
<p>This was even more surprising. Who would have thought that the prey was searching for the predator?</p>
<p>“Yep. We used to be his hunting dog a long time ago. He wants to bury that past~”</p>
<p><em>What a stupid old man.</em> Jain murmured as she shook her head.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong asked, still with a big grin on his face.</p>
<p>“So who’s participating?”</p>
<p>“Droon, Kaita, Jin Yohan, Khalifa, and Setryn. Arashi wants to focus on his research, and Yoo Kyunghwan said he’ll be retiring to live peacefully with his lover.”</p>
<p>“Then… Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong let out a dry cough and glanced at Jain. He seemingly having something to say.</p>
<p>“We’re missing… a few people.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“So it will be okay to bring someone with us.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Who? I think we have more than enough~”</p>
<p>“Mmm…. You see, I know a thing or two about this Kwang-Oh Incident….”</p>
<p>At that moment, the conversation came to a stop.</p>
<p>A strange sensation brushed past Cheok Jungyeong and Jain’s heads. But they couldn’t tell what it was. Being dull, Cheok Jungyeong tried to continue what he was saying, but he soon stopped, feeling that something was wrong.</p>
<p>“Right, this Kwang-Oh Incident….”</p>
<p>He couldn’t remember a name.</p>
<p>“What is it~? Just say it~”</p>
<p>“No… Um, what was his name? The Black Seat….”</p>
<p>“Hajin?”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, Hajin. Is this related to Hajin?”</p>
<p>Hajin.</p>
<p>For a moment, he couldn’t remember that name.</p>
<p>It was a name he could never forget, so why? Did he hurt his head while he was fighting?</p>
<p>Jain spoke, “Yeah, you’re right. That’s the day Boss met Hajin for the first time. She killed everyone in the evacuation shelter except Hajin.”</p>
<p>“…Anyways, I know someone else who’s related to that incident.”</p>
<p>“Really~? Who~?”</p>
<p>Jain pretended to be surprised and perked up her ears.</p>
<p>“I doubt she’ll want to work with trash like us, but… it’s Jin Seyeon.”</p>
<p>“What? Jin Seyeon!?”</p>
<p>This time, she really was surprised.</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon had personally told Cheok Jungyeong during their forced stay inside the Colosseum. Jin Seyeon tried to evoke sympathy from Cheok Jungyeong by revealing her past so that she could dig information related to how the Chameleon Troupe was involved with ‘Kwang-Oh Incident’. Of course, it was futile. Cheok Jungyeong had known very little about the incident.</p>
<p>“Jin Seyeon has a grudge against them too. She said her father died because of them.”</p>
<p>Jain stared at Cheok Jungyeong with a surprised look. Then, she made a strange smile.</p>
<p>“Interesting~ I’m fine with it, but if she gets involved, there might be no deaths~”</p>
<p>The mastermind behind the ‘Kwang-Oh Incident’ was without a doubt ‘Kim Sukho’ and his supporter, ‘Yi Yukho’. After that, in order of responsibility, it would be Chae Joochul, then Yoo Jangwon, then Yoo Jinwoong.</p>
<p>If Jin Seyeon suddenly interfered in this matter, she might try to resolve the matter in a ‘moral’ way.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong spoke, “I know. But it’s nice to have someone like that. Kind of like that guy… uh… the Black Seat.”</p>
<p>“Hajin?”</p>
<p>“Right, right. It’s more fun if there’s someone like him. You know, different opinions clashing and creating unexpected situations.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong grinned. Jain also smiled. But the reason for Jain’s smile was slightly different than Cheok Jungyeong’s.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon would undoubtedly suggest capturing them to make them be ‘punished by the law’. In other words, what Cheok Jungyeong was hoping - killing until one side was dead - would not happen.</p>
<p>Despite this, Cheok Jungyeong wanted to invite her.</p>
<p>Jain guessed why, and that was what made her smile.</p>
<p>“Fine~ Let her know. I doubt she’ll say yes so easily, though.”</p>
<p>“She will if I tell her. Anyways, I'll contact her.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong turned on his smartwatch.</p>
<p>[Jin Seyeon]</p>
<p>The number she gave him was stored in it. He was reluctant at the time and thought he would never call her.</p>
<p>With a relaxed smile, Cheok Jungyeong pressed the call-button.</p>
<p><em>Tu— Tu—</em></p>
<p>As the dial rang, Cheok Jungyeong’s heartbeat began to quicken. He pretended to be oblivious as to what this meant, while secretly telling himself it was a feeling of competition. After all, Jin Seyeon was a Master-rank Hero.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I revived.</p>
<p>This was the second revival I experienced from my Unique skill, [Clockhand of Fate], but it wasn’t any more pleasant than the first one.</p>
<p>Death was still death, and the fear and pain from the dying moment remained vivid in my mind.</p>
<p>This time, I even experienced what one would call ‘life flashing before one’s eyes’.</p>
<p>But strangely, most of what I saw was from ‘this world’.</p>
<p>Not the world I was born in, but the world I was currently living in.</p>
<p>Perhaps, I’ve been done in.</p>
<p>Me from Earth and me from this world. There was a huge difference between the two, to the point that it was impossible to compare them.</p>
<p>If I had to describe it, me from Earth was just an extra. I wasn’t special in any way and was just an author losing popularity.</p>
<p>But in this world….</p>
<p>“Agh!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a sharp pain shot up from my heart, almost as if it was scolding my self-reproach.</p>
<p>I clutched my chest and rolled around on the ground.</p>
<p>Thankfully, unbearable pain soon disappeared.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa….”</p>
<p>I took several hard breaths. After regaining my calm, I realized it was strange that no one was looking for me. After all, I should have made quite a racket rolling around just now.</p>
<p>Only then did I look around my surroundings.</p>
<p>“…Where am I?”</p>
<p>There was no one here.</p>
<p>Boss, Jain, Kim Suho, Cheok Jungyeong, Chae Nayun, Yoo Yeonha, Rachel, Evandel… no one.</p>
<p>The ground I was lying on was white and soft like a field of snow. But it wasn’t cold. I picked up a handful of snow. <em>Ppk- ppk-</em> I could mold this ‘snow’, but it was warm.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the sky was dark. It was dark, but bright because of the stars. They were crystal-clear, so much so that I felt like I could grasp them if I just reached out.</p>
<p>Absorbed in this beautiful scenery, I didn’t think about the system alerts until some time later.</p>
<p>“Oh right, the system.”</p>
<p>There were several messages I didn’t get to read.</p>
<p>[The final arc, ‘Final Name’, has been completed.]</p>
<p>[All SP has been retrieved.]</p>
<p>[▷??? is revealed.]</p>
<p>[▷Decision]</p>
<p>[You can now make a decision as the author….]</p>
<p>It was then. <em>Ssk-</em> I heard the sound of footsteps on the snowy field. I immediately turned my head.</p>
<p>There, a man I didn’t recognize was walking toward me.</p>
<p>He looked ordinary in every way. Neither his face nor physique stood out.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Kim Hajin-ssi. Since the final arc ended, I’ve come to see you to fulfill my promise.”</p>
<p>However, what he said wasn’t ordinary whatsoever. In fact, it was extraordinary to the point it shook my heart. I looked up at him while sitting dazedly on the ground.</p>
<p>He smiled nonchalantly and bowed.</p>
<p>“I am the co-author. Thank you for clearing the story I continued as I pleased.”</p>
<p>Looking at him, all sorts of thoughts popped up in my head. However, none of them came out of my mouth. They floated up like bubbles and only stayed at the top of my head.</p>
<p>But this man seemed to have read my mind, as he answered what I was most curious about.</p>
<p>“Ah, you must be wondering who I am. I am someone with a similar job as you. I guess you could call me a scenario writer. The official name is ‘Dimensional Author’. Ah, it’s not a job that exists for the purpose of satisfying someone. Like I said before, it’s a ‘self-gratifying’ job. Unlike Hajin-ssi, I am not from a ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’, so my job is determined at birth. A so-called vocation, if you will. Anyways, I am not a human, but a universal existence.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t understand what he said. The man also threw out too much information.</p>
<p>Seeing that I was staring at him blankly, the man chuckled and waved his hand side to side.</p>
<p>“Haha, of course, we’re nothing compared to your kind. ‘Universal existence’ might sound grand, but we’re only beings derived from the novels of the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’. Well, we’re in a better spot comparatively since we can at least create lesser dimensions…. Anyways, I’m sure this isn’t enough to answer your questions, so I will explain as simply and clearly as I can.”</p>
<p><em>Kuhum.</em> The man cleared his throat and poured out a flurry of words.</p>
<p>“A long, long time ago, I was born to create a dimension. So I wandered trying to find a dimension I could create. But with my power, it was impossible to create a dimension. I needed the Permission of the Author - something possessed only by the pinnacle-ranked dimension’s creator, who created his own world. But at the time, I was too insignificant and could only observe the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’. I worked hard for thousands of years and, in the end, the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’ succeeded in reaching the Digital World. That was truly a stroke of fortune from the heavens.</p>
<p>The man pretended to wipe off the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>“Really, what a relief that was. I was just as lucky as you, Hajin-ssi.”</p>
<p>At that moment, a lightbulb shot up in my head.</p>
<p>“T-That [email protected]?”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. That’s me!”</p>
<p>The man clapped. I snapped out of my daze and spat out the first question.</p>
<p>“So… you’re some sort of a universal existence that can create dimensions. You were looking for novels you wanted to materialize and chose me?”</p>
<p>“Yes! You’re right!”</p>
<p>“W-Why? Why my novel?”</p>
<p>“Ah! It’s not because I wanted to. If I had a choice, I would have loved to materialize a masterpiece like The Silmarillion. There are many reasons, but most importantly, there aren’t many authors who would allow a published work, especially one that was being serialized, to be remade. As I said before, we cannot create without the author’s permission. And, to be honest, I can’t create a masterpiece like The Silmarillion even if the author gives permission. I simply lack the ability to. I needed a novel that was poorly written but had enough structure and elements that I wouldn’t be embarrassed by it…. Ah, ignore that, kuhum.”</p>
<p>The man spoke at length again.</p>
<p>But there was one word that bothered me during this drawn-out speech. And that was ‘permission’.</p>
<p>“Wait, permission?”</p>
<p>“Yes. There are many Dimensional Authors even in the world I’m from, but there aren’t many like me, who only aim for the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’. For the record, one day for the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’ is equivalent to one year for us. In other words, the six months you ignored my email was 180 years for me. Ah, it’s not like I resent you for it. I can only send an email once every 90 years anyways. That would be about 3 months in the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension.’”</p>
<p>“N-No, that’s not what I’m talking about.”</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded. Truly dumbfounded.</p>
<p>He couldn’t do anything without my ‘permission’?</p>
<p>“Permission? What permission? What about all the changes you made? You changed them however you liked!”</p>
<p>“Eh~? What do you mean? You gave me permission, remember?”</p>
<p>“…What? Permission?”</p>
<p>“Yes! It was clearly written in the email! You don’t know how happy I was when you approved of those three sentences!”</p>
<p>In an instant, my head turned blank.</p>
<p><em>Deng-</em> A bell seemed to ring inside my head.</p>
<p>All of this really happened because of that email?</p>
<p>My life changed so much because of those three sentences?</p>
<p>“To be honest, I thought it unfair. Because what were three, insignificant sentences to you made me feel like I obtained the whole world.”</p>
<p><em>Tak!</em> The man snapped his fingers. Then, a string of messages popped up in the air.</p>
<p>[Pinnacle-ranked Dimension - The ultimate stable world where Kim Hajin and other authors live.]</p>
<p>[High-ranked Dimension - Omitted]</p>
<p>[High-intermediate-ranked Dimension - My world]</p>
<p>[Intermediate-ranked Dimension - The world of your novel, ‘Returner Hero’.]</p>
<p>[Low-intermediate-ranked Dimension - Omitted]</p>
<p>[Low-ranked Dimension - Your minigame character, Litrain, lives here.]</p>
<p>[Lowest-ranked Dimension - Omitted]</p>
<p>“This makes sense, right? This is how dimensions are ranked. I observed the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’ for close to ten-thousand years. Though, that would only be 20~30 years in the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension.’”</p>
<p>The man snapped his fingers again. The messages in the air vanished.</p>
<p>“Anyways, your ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’ truly has all kinds of people. Lazy people, grieving people, loving people, murderous people, excited people, content-creating people…. I was envious of all of them. You once thought you were an extra who was no different than a speck of dust in the overall picture of the world, right? But in the eyes of real extras like me, you look like a main character who shines brighter than anyone else in the world.”</p>
<p>“…No, that’s not the problem. Right… so… you’re saying those three sentences you sent changed my life like this?”</p>
<p>An empty chuckle escaped my lips.</p>
<p>The co-author smiled and looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>“Yes, and this is also unfair. That an email someone thoughtlessly replied to was significant enough to create a world.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I shut my mouth.</p>
<p>I didn’t care to hear any more of his explanations. Even if I did, I would only sigh at my fate.</p>
<p>Now was the time to bring up a more important matter.</p>
<p>“Whatever. So, what’s going to happen to me now?”</p>
<p>“It’s simple. You have to make a decision. You can leave the world of your novel or stay in it.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>I noticed that my voice was shaking. I expected something like this, so it was clear what questions to ask.</p>
<p>“What happens if I leave this world?”</p>
<p>“Since the author is no longer in the novel, the novel will stop. As a result, the world will crumble.”</p>
<p>“…What? All of it?”</p>
<p>I was dumbstruck to the point my hair stood on their ends, but the man nodded his head as if it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>“Of course. Isn’t that obvious? I am not the one maintaining this world. It is you, from the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’, the one with a noble soul. Without you, a mere intermediate-ranked dimension will stop instantly and slowly rot until it disappears.”</p>
<p>The man heaved out a light sigh and continued.</p>
<p>“But you can safely return to Earth. You don’t have to worry about the passage of time. Less than ten days would have passed in the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’. There’s a chance that not even a day went by. I’m not sure about the exact metrics of time…. Oh right, if you’d like, I can erase all the memories you have of this world!”</p>
<p>An empty laugh escaped my lips.</p>
<p>I laughed audibly and clutched my head.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the man continued talking.</p>
<p>“If you go back to your world, please remake this world in prose. I’d like to see it too. That single novel will be far greater than all of the worlds I’ve created combined-”</p>
<p>“…Great, my ass.”</p>
<p>I grit my teeth and cut him off.</p>
<p>“Pardon? Ah, you must not have understood me correctly-”</p>
<p>“I did, you piece of shit. That’s why I’m angry. This world… the world you ‘created’… is far greater than mine.”</p>
<p>A third-rate author who couldn’t even meet his daily release times and eventually went on hiatus.</p>
<p>There was no way the novel I write would be greater than this world.</p>
<p>Plus, I didn’t think I created this world. I only lived in it.</p>
<p>“Hmm… I see.”</p>
<p>A small smile spread across his face.</p>
<p>He turned slightly more serious and asked.</p>
<p>“Then what is your decision?”</p>
<p>“There’s something else I want to ask.”</p>
<p>I was curious about one more thing. Perhaps it was more important than anything else.</p>
<p>“…Can I die in this world? Am I immortal, like Baal?”</p>
<p>“No, you can die. And even if you do, this world will not stop. Because your soul will stay and maintain this world. That was why Baal wanted to kill you.”</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>A sigh escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>From the sound of it, I didn’t have a choice from the beginning. From the moment I was synchronized to this world, from the moment I came to love its people, my decision was set.</p>
<p>I actually felt a bit relieved.</p>
<p>So, I made a bittersweet smile…</p>
<p>“Of course, you can choose to remain here. But I would not recommend it, because you will become a dimensional existence of a much lesser rank than the ‘pinnacle-ranked dimension’! Plus-!”</p>
<p>The man stiffened his face frighteningly and raised his finger.</p>
<p>“As you will no longer be an author, you will lose ‘everything’ you obtained from the power of the author. You should know what this means, right? This includes personal relationships, and not just abilities.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I became speechless.</p>
<p>What he was saying was truly frightening.</p>
<p>I couldn’t think. The inside of my head turned blank like a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The emptiness inside my head then began to fill up with everything I built up. The faces of countless people flashed by.</p>
<p>“Now, choose. You don’t have much time left. Ten minutes in this world is equivalent to a day outside.”</p>
<p>The man urged me.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t answer.</p>
<p>If he came to see me on the ‘first day’, when I wasn’t even ‘Kim Hajin’, my decision would have been simple. I would have returned home, to the world I came from.</p>
<p>“Ah….”</p>
<p>But now… how could he ask this now? After so goddamn long?</p>
<p>I spent too much time in this world. To forget everything and let it crumble… I… I’ve come to care about this world too much.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>In the end, I began to walk, delaying the decision.</p>
<p>My footsteps became engraved in the snowy field.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>The co-author asked.</p>
<p>I replied briefly.</p>
<p>“…I’m going back.”</p>
<p>The co-author asked back.</p>
<p>“To where?”</p>
<p>I vision blurred. Small droplets of water fell onto the field.</p>
<p>I was crying.</p>
<p>“…To home.”</p>
<p>“And where is your home?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I couldn’t answer. It was hard enough to still be standing.</p>
<p>I simply walked on the white path. I walked and walked. Traces of tears and footsteps appeared on the snowy field.</p>
<p>Behind him, the co-author’s chilling voice rang out. It shook my ears like an empty echo.</p>
<p>“The evanescence should progress slowly.”</p>
<p>I continued to walk.</p>
<p>If I continued on this path, I should eventually find myself home.</p>
<p>I didn’t know where that home would be, but I was certain I would be there.</p>
<p>So I told myself to walk.</p>
<p>A little more, a little more.</p>
<p>So that I wouldn’t be miserable. So that I wouldn’t regret….</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 366. A Story That Shouldn’t Have Existed (1)</p>
<p>Inside a tranquil forest, where the appearance of demons had stopped people from entering, a woman carrying a bow was walking. Seeing how she checked her smartwatch for where to go, one could tell this was her first time here. However, she didn’t seem nervous in any way.</p>
<p>After treading on the grassy field for some time, the woman stopped when she arrived at her destination. A small log cabin was standing amidst the trees and vegetation.</p>
<p>The woman stood in front of it. The wooden door had no decorations and only a simple doorknob.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>When she grabbed the knob after taking a deep breath, the person inside opened the door first. Startled, the woman took a step back.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re here~”</p>
<p>A woman greeted her with a bright smile. The woman inside the cabin treated the visiting woman affectionately as if they were old friends.</p>
<p>However, the visiting woman didn’t enter the cabin and stood outside the door. She looked into the cabin beyond the smiling woman’s shoulders.</p>
<p>The wide sight of the ‘Divine Archer’ unfolded.</p>
<p>There were people she was familiar with and also people she only saw through documents.</p>
<p>“Don’t just stand there. Come in~”</p>
<p>Jain called her amicably. Beyond her shoulders were Khalifa, Setryn, Jin Yohan, and Cheok Jungyeong. Only after confirming the members of the Chameleon Troupe did she open her mouth.</p>
<p>“No, not yet. I haven’t accepted your offer.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then why are you here~?”</p>
<p>“…I have a condition. I am willing to cooperate so long as you agree.”</p>
<p>“Oh? And what’s that~?”</p>
<p>Jain asked with a giggle.</p>
<p><em>Koong—</em> At that moment, the cabin shook, and Cheok Jungyeong rose from a seat in the darkness. Due to his huge stature, his head almost touched the ceiling.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon swallowed hard. But as she had come determined, she spoke without wavering.</p>
<p>“There can be no killing during this process. I will make them face the punishment of the law.”</p>
<p>When she said this, five gazes inside the cabin fell on her. Jin Seyeon felt her muscles tense up as she waited for Jain’s response.</p>
<p>“…Mm~ We expected as much~”</p>
<p>Thankfully, she didn’t seem to be against it. In fact, she seemed to be saying, ‘Try it if you can’.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon thought inwardly.</p>
<p>The rumor seemed to be true.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe supposedly had an ironclad rule. And that was— to solve any disagreements with a fight, with the victor having the final say.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon was confident in her abilities, but the one facing her, Cheok Jungyeong, was a tough opponent. Of course, that didn’t mean she had no chance of winning. She had brought [Huang Zhong’s Bow] precisely because of this rule.</p>
<p>“Huhu.”</p>
<p>Jain, who was rubbing her chin and pondering, suddenly broke out into a smile. Jin Seyeon roused her five senses and grabbed her bow.</p>
<p>Jain spoke.</p>
<p>“Sure~ Let’s do that~”</p>
<p>She agreed.</p>
<p>“In that case…. Eh?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon was taking out her bow in preparation when she heard his and became dazed. ‘What did I just hear?’ She stared at Jain blankly and tilted her head.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Jain said it once again.</p>
<p>“We’ll do that. No killing. Only justice. You guys are okay with that, right~?”</p>
<p>But what was even weirder was the other members’ reaction. Jin Seyeon was sure Cheok Jungyeong would disagree, but even he was nodding his head.</p>
<p>Jain grinned.</p>
<p>“Then you’ll be working with us now, right?”</p>
<p>“Huh…? Ah, wait?!”</p>
<p>Jain grabbed Jin Seyeon’s hand and pulled her into the cabin.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Essence of the Strait, Chief Officer’s Office]</p>
<p>Five days had gone by since the victory against Baal. Yoo Yeonha was currently sitting on her office chair, staring out the window.</p>
<p>The sky that had been reddish-black returned to its clear color. Just looking at the endless, blue sky warmed her up. The chirps of the birds, the fluffy clouds, and the blazing sun all seemed beautiful.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shook off this sentiment with a sigh and turned her gaze to her desk. A mountainload of documents were stacked there. They were all post-war matters she had to take care of.</p>
<p>Despite being overloaded with work, Yoo Yeonha clenched her fists and encouraged herself. Once everything was taken care of, Essence of the Strait would meet its second prime and rise above Korea to become the ruler of the world.</p>
<p>As she was focusing on the documents again, Yoo Yeonha caught sight of yesterday’s newspaper.</p>
<p>[Shin Jonghak’s Confession - This was a disaster brought upon by Shin Myungchul’s Regression!]</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Looking at it, she felt her heart become heavy. After the annihilation of Baal, the confession Shin Jonghak made caused a huge stir around the globe. As a result, Shin Myungchul’s previous position as the Saint Hero shook.</p>
<p>But because of Shin Jonghak’s achievements in fighting Baal, his decision to donate most of his family’s wealth to rebuilding, the still-existing threat of demons, and most importantly, Yoo Yeonha’s terrifying media manipulation helped Shin Myungchul avoid becoming ‘trash that should burn in hell’ (as Jin Sahyuk put it).</p>
<p>“…Ehew.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha sighed once again and moved the newspaper to the corner of the desk. She suddenly remembered her father, who had promised her to make ‘a certain announcement’ soon.</p>
<p><em>Jiing—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, her smartwatch vibrated. It was from her secretary, Jin Sechan. He had been living in the Republic of Leores0o 0and had only returned thanks to Shimurin’s power. Apparently, he worked as a secretary there too.</p>
<p>—This is Jin Sechan.</p>
<p>“Yes, go ahead.”</p>
<p>— The demons have launched a surprise attack in Seoul. Their commander is one of the New Evils. Their goal seems to be the ‘Demonic Energy Gem’ that is currently under the Association’s management.</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha rested her chin on her palm.</p>
<p>Although the threat of Baal had disappeared, demons still remained on Earth. Despite descending on Earth along with Baal, they had chosen to stay and live here afterward. Some even joined the Djinns’ forces to make Pandemonium their home.</p>
<p>Because of this, a new term called the ‘New Evils’ had been coined. Although the Nine Evils collapsed during the war, the few members of the Nine Evils who survived had formed a new organization.</p>
<p>“If it’s Seoul… there’s nothing to worry about. Kim Suho happens to be there. Ah, but send some people over, so we can look the part.”</p>
<p>—Yes, understood. And about what you’ve said before. The Chameleon Troupe Foundation…</p>
<p>“The Chameleon Toupe has disbanded.”</p>
<p>—My apologies. The Yi Byul Foundation is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe had disbanded, and Yi Byul remained as Yoo Yeonha’s partner. Yoo Yeonha had fervently recruited her. By tweaking her background a little bit, Yoo Yeonha felt like Yi Byul could act as Essence of the Strait’s Hero. After all, it seemed like she was interested in the job.</p>
<p>“What about it?”</p>
<p>—Well, it’s about the scale of her wealth…. I’ll send you the relevant info.</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha didn’t think too much of it, but when she saw what Jin Sechan sent her, she doubted her eyes.</p>
<p>“…She really amassed quite a fortune.”</p>
<p>Yi Byul’s wealth was enough to make even Yoo Yeonha surprised.</p>
<p>She possessed more than ten private islands, and including all the treasures, artifacts, stocks, and ‘World of Wish’ items, her wealth was hundreds of trillions of won.</p>
<p>They were all assets that would only increase in price as time passed.</p>
<p>“Oh? She was a majority shareholder of our companies? With this much, she should be able to single-handedly feed all war orphans.”</p>
<p>Her assets included stocks of Essence of the Strait’s subsidiaries. She even had them on a business scale rather than an individual one. She sure was greedy.</p>
<p>—We’re managing her assets as efficiently as we can, but the sheer scale of it is making it a bit difficult….</p>
<p>“Be as honest as possible and donate most of the profits. Make sure you watch the employees so they don’t do anything stupid from greed.”</p>
<p>Yi Byul was the former leader of the Chameleon Troupe. Doing something underhanded could get them all killed.</p>
<p>—Yes, understood. Then we will put out focus on rescuing children.</p>
<p>“Great.”</p>
<p>—I’m hanging up.</p>
<p>When the video call ended, Yoo Yeonha stretched. Then, she picked up her smartwatch to rest a bit. Rachel had messaged her while Yoo Yeonha was working.</p>
<p>[Rachel - Photo]</p>
<p>“Ah, this.”</p>
<p>She quickly tapped on the message.</p>
<p>As expected, a picture of Evandel popped up.</p>
<p>She must have just eaten cake as she had whipped cream all over her mouth.</p>
<p>“She…. She’s too cute.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha stared in a daze, then began to type a reply while her shoulders trembled.</p>
<p>[Hiding something so cute… God, she’s so cute. Oh yeah~ Didn’t you say Evandel liked dolls, right? The next time we meet—]</p>
<p>“…Mm?”</p>
<p>While typing a response, she suddenly felt like she was forgetting something. She felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>She was only sending a message, so what was she embarrassed about?</p>
<p>Because she couldn’t figure out the reason no matter how hard she thought about it, she erased the message she already had and just got to the main point.</p>
<p>[You don’t have to use Evandel as a weapon to convince me. The conference will happen. I’ll take the portal over at 6 p.m. two days later. I plan to be generous during this conference with England, but I suggest that you don’t go too overboard with requests.]</p>
<p>Rachel’s reply came quickly.</p>
<p>[Of course. Evandel and I are eagerly waiting, President ^-^~]</p>
<p>This message even came with two pictures of Evandel. The first was her jumping after a butterfly, and the second was her taking a nap with Hayang.</p>
<p>“Wow…. Ah.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Yoo Yeonha’s face melted from the cuteness, but she quickly let out a dry cough and went back to work.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Seoul Special City - Road to Gwanghwamun]</p>
<p>The difference between a limousine and a standard car was simple.</p>
<p>If a standard car went <em>clunk- clunk-</em> as it drove, a limousine would go <em>shooong-</em> and go forward like a snake. It was obvious why people would choose the latter. It was a natural decision given the human’s instinctual desire to survive. After all, <em>shooong-</em> was quicker and safer than <em>clunk- clunk-</em>.</p>
<p>“Ah… mm, ah. Mm. Ah, mm….”</p>
<p>But a mutant defying the natural state was bound to exist. Sitting in the back seat of the limousine, Kim Suho twisted his body in discomfort.</p>
<p>Like a child who was holding in his pee, he squirmed for a long time before finally speaking out loud.</p>
<p>“I think it’ll be faster for me to get off and go on foot.”</p>
<p>“No. This is an official business matter at an official place.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s personal secretary refused firmly. Kim Suho scratched the back of his neck. As expected of the ‘witch’ who formerly served the Demon King, she was thorough in taking care of her master.</p>
<p>Today, Kim Suho had returned from Manchuria’s battlefield and was heading to the Hero Association.</p>
<p>Although only five days had passed since the annihilation of Baal and the demons that descended with Baal still remained within Pandemonium, the Association was hosting a banquet.</p>
<p>Kim Suho, of course, didn’t want to go. But because the former president, Kim Sukho, insisted, he had no other choice. Yun Seung-Ah wanted him to go too if possible, and Kim Suho also felt like he owed him since the scholarship he gave made Kim Suho’s family’s lives a bit easier.</p>
<p>“Kuhum.”</p>
<p>Instead of resisting, Kim Suho unfastened two of the cumbersome suit buttons and looked out the window.</p>
<p>Under the clear, blue sky, the view of Han River entered his sight. After watching the surface glistening like jewels, Kim Suho turned his head thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Then, he faced a woman who wasn’t there a moment ago.</p>
<p>After appearing without a trace, she had naturally taken the seat next to him.</p>
<p>How should he put this? It was a rather terrifying, horror movie-like experience.</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s heart jumped up at the woman’s sudden appearance, but he tried to look calm as he stared at her.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>The ghost… no, Jin Sahyuk asked.</p>
<p>Kim Suho glanced at his secretary. She was stealing glances at the back mirror, but it didn’t look like she had any intention of kicking Jin Sahyuk out.</p>
<p>“…The Association.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho replied leisurely.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk perked up her brows as if this took her by surprise.</p>
<p>“You? Why are you diving into politics?”</p>
<p>“It’s not politics. It’s not like it’s a meaningless conference either.”</p>
<p>“…To be honest, I don’t care about someone like you. What about that guy?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked. Kim Suho fell into thought. That guy? Was she talking about Shin Jonghak?</p>
<p>“Jonghak should be in Africa right now.”</p>
<p>“No, not that retard.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows. Kim Suho tilted his head and asked back.</p>
<p>“Then who?”</p>
<p>“That guy. You know, that guy.”</p>
<p>“Stop being cryptic. Who’s….”</p>
<p>He suddenly stopped in the middle of his sentence. An unpleasant sensation emerged in his head like something was on the tip of his tongue.</p>
<p>But no matter how hard he thought about it, nothing popped up.</p>
<p>This ‘someone’, whom he naturally forgot, was hard to remember through unnatural means.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. You don’t have to hide him. I won’t try to bring him to my world.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk said with a shrug. But the more Jin Sahyuk acted this way, the more confused Kim Suho got.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>When she saw that Kim Suho was staring at her with a confused look, she continued in frustration.</p>
<p>“I’m going to leave alone, okay? I don’t want to involve an unrelated person.”</p>
<p>Only then did Kim Suho think of words to say.</p>
<p>“…You’re leaving? To Akatrina?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Unlike you, I have a strong attachment to my homeworld.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s voice carried a rueful pride. Jin Sahyuk wanted to go back home as soon as possible, and the only reason she was still on Earth was to make preparations - like gathering food.</p>
<p>Kim Suho stared into Jin Sahyuk’s eyes. They were no longer blood-thirsty like in the past but instead deep and full of life. Her eyes were glistening with a righteous will.</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled bitterly and shook his head.</p>
<p>“I miss our homeworld too.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, because your homeworld is Earth. Stop playing with words and tell me—”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho cut off Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glared at Kim Suho with a scowl.</p>
<p>“I miss Akatrina too. That’s my homeworld. I’m still using the swordsmanship I learned in Akatrina here, and I’m still living by the principles I set there. No matter how much I deny it, I can’t erase Akatrina from my heart.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“So I decided to accept it. My life in Akatrina… wasn’t the happiest. Well, it was miserable, to be honest, but I don’t resent the world because of it. I’m here because of Akatrina, after all.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s short life in Akatrina had mostly been a mixture of betrayal, sorrow, despair, and frustration. But deep inside, there was some happiness and love as well.</p>
<p>Kim Suho finally felt like he could accept these memories as a whole.</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk angrily punched the back seat of the limousine.</p>
<p>“…Shut up. I don’t care about that. I need to know where ‘that guy’ is—”</p>
<p><em>Kiiik—</em> At that moment, the limousine suddenly came to a stop. It wasn’t just the limousine. All the cars in front of it stopped or hit the guardrail. Next, a boom rang out and shook the surroundings.</p>
<p>Kim Suho quickly threw the door open and went out to look at the situation.</p>
<p>He could see demons flying in the sky over the Han River.</p>
<p>“…Jin Sahyuk?”</p>
<p>“What.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho held up his scabbard and spoke to Jin Sahyuk who had approached him again.</p>
<p>“You’ll help, right?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Why are you so surprised? You helped us when we fought Baal, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Are you mad? Why should I? I have my hands full with Akatrina.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk narrowed her eyes dumbfoundedly.</p>
<p>Kim Suho chuckled playfully before pleading with sincerity.</p>
<p>“Your former humble servant requests of you.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk paused just as she was about to pass by. Perhaps because this was the first time Kim Suho talked to her in such a formal way, she stared at Kim Suho without moving. With emotionless eyes, she scrutinized his face.</p>
<p>Soon, a big grin emerged on her face.</p>
<p>“A request from a servant who killed his king….”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Kim Suho also smiled.</p>
<p>A servant who killed his king, and a king who killed her servant’s everything.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk didn’t apologize to Kim Suho. And Kim Suho wasn’t expecting an apology either.</p>
<p>“This benevolent lord shall grant your request.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was Jin Sahyuk because she was Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a king in the world who apologized to her servant.</p>
<p>“Thank you ve~ry much. Also… I’m sorry about the past… Pft.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho took out Misteltein as he chuckled. The sword’s brilliant light illuminated the Han River.</p>
<p>“You sure have a good sword. Of course, that just means you’re weak without your weapon.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk also chuckled and roused her magic power. Black magic power shot up, equipping her with armor and creating countless spears and swords in the air.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the demon army shot down from the sky.</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—</em></p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk fired her spears and swords and tore their bodies apart.</p>
<p>Kim Suho also sent sword strikes flying at the fearless demons who didn’t know who they were facing. As he swung his sword and looked at his Misteltein slicing his enemies in halves…</p>
<p>…He couldn’t remember anything.</p>
<p><em>What was it?</em></p>
<p><em>Wasn’t there something important about this sword?</em></p>
<p><em>Memories with a precious person should be stored in this sword….</em></p>
<p><em>So why?</em></p>
<p><em>Why can’t I remember?</em></p>
<p>Kim Suho forgot naturally, and he couldn’t remember naturally.</p>
<p>But he wanted to remember.</p>
<p>He desperately wanted to recall.</p>
<p>But—</p>
<p>“Kuhahahahaha—! So you’re Kim Suho!”</p>
<p>A loud, ringing roar interrupted his thoughts. Next, a powerful enemy appeared and blocked Kim Suho’s path.</p>
<p>“It’s good to see you—!”</p>
<p>He seemed to know Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Kim Suho could also identify him by his appearance.</p>
<p>A demon whose entire body was wrapped in black metal. Although he looked like he was wearing a ridiculous, full-body spandex suit, his 3-meter-tall height, monstrous muscles, and intimidating facial features made him the most famous member of the New Evils.</p>
<p>He went by the name Iron Evil Lord. The number of High-ranked Heroes he attacked totaled 28, and 20 of them had lost their lives. He was not an opponent to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>“I shall be the one to kill you—!”</p>
<p>As iron nails flew toward him— Kim Suho stopped thinking.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…When I opened my eyes, I was in the middle of Seoul Station.</p>
<p>It was unlikely that Boss abandoned me here, so it must have been the co-author’s doing.</p>
<p>I was thankful.</p>
<p>The co-author had said that the ‘evanescence would progress slowly’. That meant Boss would forget me even while I was in front of her. Being here like this was far better than seeing her forget.</p>
<p>I checked today’s date with the newspaper covering my stomach. About six days had passed since Baal’s annihilation.</p>
<p>After checking the date, I checked what I still had with me.</p>
<p>But as expected, there was nothing.</p>
<p>Gifts, Authorities, Arts, Physiques, Skills, SP, the System, DP, items…. Everything I obtained through the power of the author was gone.</p>
<p>Immediately, I was at a loss for what to do for the future. The reality I tried to deny flooded in like a tidal wave, and a little bit of tears rose up.</p>
<p>But I had no plans to sit still and cry. I had experienced death twice. Although I lost everything I possessed, I still had the memories and persevering mindset I built-up.</p>
<p>…Though I said this, it still took me a day to leave Seoul Station.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was one place in this world where I could stay.</p>
<p>The apartment room I first woke up in.</p>
<p>The place that belonged to Chundong.</p>
<p>I headed there thinking ‘what if’, and the 90-square-meter home greeted me just as it did when I opened my eyes in this world.</p>
<p>I had returned to the place where everything began, having lost everything.</p>
<p>“…Ehew.”</p>
<p>And now.</p>
<p>I was slouched on the couch, watching TV.</p>
<p>—Although the threat of Baal has disappeared, a troublesome force called the New Evils has risen. The world’s greatest Hero Academy, ‘Cube’, has officially announced its revival.</p>
<p>That was news.</p>
<p>—Hero Shin Jonghak has decided to concentrate all his might in subjugating the New Evils. Although Shin Myungchul’s actions summoned Baal to this world, the public is still rooting for Shin Jonghak. Revealing his grandfather’s sins and trying to atone under the bright sun, one can easily tell how pure-hearted he truly is….</p>
<p>That was clearly Yoo Yeonha’s media manipulation.</p>
<p>—Hero Chae Nayun! Are you expecting to become a Master-rank Hero? Everyone from the Association is expecting it.</p>
<p>—Huh? N-No! Now’s not the time to be thinking about that sort of stuff. We have a lot of reconstruction to do. There are people we have to protect and rescue. There are lots of enemies to defeat. So I want everyone to be focused on that. Ranking Heroes as fun can come later. Anyways, I’m going back to work.</p>
<p>That was an interview with Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Around her neck was the necklace I gifted her.</p>
<p>—A nameless angel is supporting children who lost their families during the war. Even from a rough estimate, the donation amounts to a trillion won….</p>
<p>That had to be Boss.</p>
<p>Still lying on the couch, I kept my eyes on the rectangular TV screen. I looked at the people who would lead brilliant lives in the world that was no longer a novel.</p>
<p>I wrapped my hands around my face, feeling both happy and depressed.</p>
<p>—Iron Evil Lord, who attacked Han River, has been successfully defeated. The Creator’s Sacred Grace will continue to fight demons with courage and determination….</p>
<p>Kim Suho was standing on a podium, discussing a recent attack on Seoul by the Iron Evil Lord.</p>
<p>“…Well.”</p>
<p>Looking at Kim Suho, I murmured in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>“I’m sure I can survive somehow….”</p>
<p>This wasn’t my first rodeo as an extra.</p>
<p>From the beginning, I was meant to be someone who would live like I didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Since I made the decision, there was no need to regret, cry, or be sad.</p>
<p>I just had to start over from the beginning.</p>
<p>“Ah, should I really try applying as a background actor or something?”</p>
<p><em>I think I’d be a pretty good actor….</em></p>
<p>I turned off the TV and got up. After taking out a bottle of water from the fridge and drinking it, I ordered delivery. It was a 23,000 won spicy braised chicken. Thankfully, I could survive a month without starving thanks to the money Kim Chundong had in his desk.</p>
<p>After that… well, I’d probably have to look for a part-time job.</p>
<p>In any case, once I ordered food, a stifling silence filled the room.</p>
<p>It was the kind of empty silence that made you feel alone.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I picked up a chopstick from the kitchen’s utensil holder. Suddenly remembering my [Master Sharpshooter] Gift, I gave it a light throw. The chopstick… didn’t fly at a terrifying speed and simply fell and rolled on the ground.</p>
<p>“Haha, obviously.”</p>
<p>I had tried the same thing a thousand times already.</p>
<p>It was about time I accept it.</p>
<p>That ‘Kim Hajin’ as a character had really disappeared.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Ding—</em></p>
<p>The bell suddenly rang.</p>
<p>“Huh? The delivery’s here already?”</p>
<p><em>Since when did spicy braised chicken take 3 minutes to make?</em></p>
<p>I tilted my head and opened the front door.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>But no one was there. My foot only bumped into something.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>It was a huge package about the size of two boxes of fruit combined.</p>
<p>I furrowed my brows and knelt down.</p>
<p>There was a small letter attached to the side of the box.</p>
<p>[This is my final gift.]</p>
<p>“…Eh?”</p>
<p><em>Dokun—</em> Immediately, my heart jumped a beat.</p>
<p>I carefully looked around the hallway before quickly taking the box in. It was so heavy that I couldn’t lift it and had to drag it over.</p>
<p>“Haa, haa….”</p>
<p>Even doing something so simple made me gasp for air.</p>
<p>After placing the box in the living room, I considered ripping the tape apart with my hands before quickly bringing a pair of scissors from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>With a deep breath, I cut off the tape sealing the box.</p>
<p>Then, I opened it.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I became speechless.</p>
<p>Emotions welled up from deep inside my heart.</p>
<p>Inside the package was….</p>
<p>A black suit engraved with a lotus symbol and a beautiful, silver gun.</p>
<p>They were the pieces of equipment I used to use.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I stared at them blankly before hitting the box with my head.</p>
<p>I didn’t cry. I refuse to believe I did.</p>
<p>I was just grateful. Grateful that he would leave me with at least these.</p>
<p>And if I expressed my gratitude, maybe he would send me more gifts in the future.</p>
<p>“Ah… hurgh…. Uk….”</p>
<p>Strange sounds were coming out of my mouth.</p>
<p>But that was really how I felt.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 367. The Story That Should Not Have Existed (2)</p>
<p>[Kim Hajin’s Apartment]</p>
<p>I carefully placed the Black Lotus Uniform and the Desert Eagle on the couch. After longingly staring at them for a while, I looked inside the box again to see if there was anything else.</p>
<p>A small, black box was tucked away on the bottom. A box inside a box? I tilted my head as I unwrapped it.</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>Inside the black box was a smartwatch and a small envelope.</p>
<p>I first took out the smartwatch. Both the strap and the case were decorated with obsidian, giving it a luxurious look. It was the same high-tech watch that Yoo Yeonha specially created for me.</p>
<p>I tried turning it on, and it functioned properly. It had no problem recognizing me as its owner either. I could immediately see the [Kim Hajin]’s ID along with my bank accounts, stock accounts, and other personal assets stored in the [User Wallet].</p>
<p>I first checked how much money I had.</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>The wealth stored in the accounts was more than I thought. It was to the point that a surprised gasp escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>Just my bank account alone held 30 million won. In terms of stocks, I had 10 shares of Essential Pharmacy, 10 shares of Essential Dynamics, 10 shares of Essence of the Strait - all totaling to 60 million won.</p>
<p>It was faaaaaaaar less than what I had before, but I was still extremely grateful.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>But looking at my stock holdings, I suddenly remembered something from the past.</p>
<p>Whenever Boss was sulking or down, I would sell her my stocks. As Essence of the Strait’s unlisted stocks were trustworthy assets that were hard to acquire even with money, they were the medicine for elevating Boss’s mood.</p>
<p>Even though she always said she didn’t need them, the corners of her mouth would twitch up and her face would redden. She really couldn’t be cuter if she tried.</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>But when my thoughts reached this point, I had no choice but to put my smartwatch down.</p>
<p>The ripples caused by old memories spread to form a huge wave.</p>
<p>Feeling like I might lose consciousness, I leaned against the couch and sank deeper into reminiscence.</p>
<p>I began to miss everyone too much - Evandel and Rachel, Chae Nayun and Kim Suho, Yoo Yeonha and Boss., and even the friends and family who should be in my homeworld.</p>
<p>Well, I didn’t have any close friends, but I really did want to see my mom and dad. I couldn’t even imagine how they would feel once they found out I was gone.</p>
<p>‘But don’t worry. I made this decision myself. Since this world’s time flows differently, even if I die of old age, less than 100 days would have passed there….’</p>
<p>I found myself justifying my choice.</p>
<p>“…Eubebebebebe.”</p>
<p>I slapped my cheeks. Since I decided not to regret my decision, I couldn’t just stay here so pathetically.</p>
<p>I forced myself up and put on the Black Lotus Uniform. Because I got a little shorter, the tail edge of the uniform touched the ground. But the moment I thought this- <em>whish!</em>- the uniform automatically shrunk to fit my body.</p>
<p>It seemed the functionalities I added to the uniform were still there.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>I looked at myself in a full-length mirror before storing the Desert Eagle in the holster. The Desert Eagle was extremely light.</p>
<p>I then sat down on the couch. It was time to think about what to do from now.</p>
<p>But because I couldn’t come up with anything, I picked up my smartwatch to surf the Internet.</p>
<p>“…She said it had Internet connection, right?”</p>
<p>I remembered Yoo Yeonha bragging to me about it in the past - that this smartwatch was higher-tech than most high-tech computers on the market.</p>
<p>I placed the smartwatch on the table and changed to the desktop mode. A hologram keyboard and a monitor projected themselves into the air.</p>
<p>While I was browsing through web portals, a certain website caught my attention.</p>
<p>It was a ReadNovelFull site.</p>
<p>When I saw it, a smile emerged on my face.</p>
<p>“…Should I write a novel?”</p>
<p>If I wrote the past ten or so years I’ve experienced as a novel…. No, it probably wouldn’t be that fun.</p>
<p>I had no plans to write another novel ever again.</p>
<p>I threw the thought away and began to search for other websites, mainly focusing on job boards.</p>
<p>I wanted to work. At the very least, I wanted to feel that ‘I was alive’.</p>
<p>[Welcome to Korea’s biggest mercenary website - Desert Soul.]</p>
<p>[Open Recruitment for Mercenaries]</p>
<p>[Mission Requests]</p>
<p>[Check/Cancel Missions]</p>
<p>“Mercenary?”</p>
<p>This was quite tempting. I had the Desert Eagle for offense and the Black Lotus Uniform for defense. It should be difficult for most attacks to penetrate the uniform’s defensive power.</p>
<p>However, the problem was my lackluster sharpshooting ability.</p>
<p>I also didn’t want to jump back into the midst of battle when I only barely managed to escape from it.</p>
<p>“Oh right, there was something else.”</p>
<p>I approached the black box again, remembering the small envelope that came with the smartwatch.</p>
<p>The envelope was thick as if it had a letter.</p>
<p>“Let’s see….”</p>
<p>Feeling lonely, I muttered to myself as I tore open the envelope.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>From the envelope, a small water droplet fell down and clung to my body. I was surprised at first, but I immediately became grateful.</p>
<p>I recognized this water droplet.</p>
<p>It was the ‘formless’ weapon that was neither a fluid nor a solid and was the first Unique-ranked item I ever obtained in this world.</p>
<p>Although it was far smaller than what it was in the past, this was, without a doubt, Aether.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see you again.”</p>
<p>I stopped myself from tearing up at Aether’s familiar sensation and accepted it. Aether stuck to my body like glue.</p>
<p>But even after Aether popped out, the envelope remained thick.</p>
<p>Wondering if there was something else inside, I peeked into it.</p>
<p>There was a paper inside.</p>
<p>“This is….”</p>
<p>I reached into the envelope with my fingers and pulled out the paper. On the surface of this coupon-like paper were words written in strange handwriting.</p>
<p>[Physique Acquisition Coupon - Medicinal Memory Physique]</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>The moment I saw it, laughter escaped my mouth. It was a happy, pleasant kind of laughter.</p>
<p>It seemed this was the last gift the co-author left for me.</p>
<p>But I didn’t know why it was [Medicinal Memory Physique]. Why wasn’t it Master Sharpshooter, Magic Dysfunction Physique, Random Consolidation System, or Parkour?</p>
<p>Well, I couldn’t really complain.</p>
<p>Since this was the only Physique the co-author left for me, I had to formulate my future plans using it.</p>
<p>I looked at the hologram monitor again. After entering the [Help Wanted Cafe] again, I searched for a certain keyword.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「Search」 - 「Essential Pharmacy」</p>
<p>「15,321 posts including “Essential Pharmacy”」</p>
<p>—The open recruitment notice for Essential Pharmacy is out. It looks like they’re going to hire a large number of people this time. Is anyone here looking to apply?</p>
<p>—Essential Pharmacy’s test is too hard and unpredictable…. Last time, I hear the question was how to kill a dragon or something.</p>
<p>—I heard the salary for the researcher position is incredible. And because of the war against the New Evils….</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…That’s right.”</p>
<p>After reading through the posts for about three minutes, I nodded my head.</p>
<p>This was the best way I could utilize the Medicinal Memory Physique.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I had killed too many people of this world.</p>
<p>At first, I justified myself by saying they were only characters in the novel. After I recognized this world as a real world, I changed the story to it being necessary.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was the reason that the co-author left this Physique.</p>
<p>He had left me an ability that could <em>save</em> people, rather than kill….</p>
<p>Suddenly, what Kim Suho told me in the past brushed past my ears.</p>
<p>‘Everyone in this world is the main character.’</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>Even if everyone forgot about me, I could lead my own life. Perhaps I might be able to live a much more faithful life than before. At the very least, the current me wouldn’t do something as stupid as treating this world as a novel.</p>
<p>With a grin, I gripped the [Medicinal Memory Physique Coupon].</p>
<p>Then, <em>chweeek—</em> I ripped it in half.</p>
<p>A blue current flowed out from the torn cross-section of the coupon.</p>
<p>Thus, the current carrying the ‘Physique’ slowly seeped into my body.</p>
<p>“…Whew.”</p>
<p>Although the medicinal effects I had memorized before should have been reset, it didn’t matter. I could just start over from the beginning.</p>
<p>“Let’s see….”</p>
<p><em>Chak, chack—!</em> I clapped my hands energetically and accessed the website.</p>
<p>…And 5 minutes later.</p>
<p>I realized that Essential Pharmacy’s open recruitment… required an ‘educational background’.</p>
<p>It made sense. I mean, what pharmaceutical company would accept someone who didn’t attend med school? Because it was such an obvious thing, it wasn’t even listed on the employment site.</p>
<p>“Ehew. Well… I don’t want to give up…. Guess I’ll apply to the sales department or something….”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[England - Buckingham Palace]</p>
<p>Inside a private office in Buckingham Palace, Rachel was with Evandel, who was busy talking to her friends over a video call.</p>
<p>“Un~ See you later! I have lots of time now!”</p>
<p>—Evandel, you’re famous now! Are you sure?!</p>
<p>“Mhm! Don’t worry, I have time! Heehee.”</p>
<p>—Yay! Then we’ll be waiting for you~!</p>
<p>Seeing Evandel smiling brightly as she talked to her friends, Rachel had a rather random thought. Did young kids always use exclamation marks (!) when they were talking to their friends…?</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t it.</p>
<p>Then what was it that she was thinking about?</p>
<p>Rachel furrowed her brows but failed to find out.</p>
<p>“Un~ See you~”</p>
<p>At that moment, Evandel hung up. Evandel smiled bloomingly, then spat out ‘those words’.</p>
<p>“I want to see you~”</p>
<p>I want to see you. Rachel didn’t know what that meant.</p>
<p>Recently, either as a form of sleep talking or an instinctual calling, she began to say the words ‘I want to see you~’</p>
<p>She would say this in the middle of eating, showering, running around, and even sleeping.</p>
<p>“I want to see you~”</p>
<p>It was almost like a habit. Even when Rachel asked who she wanted to see, Evandel would only tilt her head.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok-</em></p>
<p>At that moment, a couple knocking noises rang out, and the royal court’s secretary spoke.</p>
<p>—She is almost here.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha seemed to almost be here.</p>
<p>Rachel returned a simple yes and walked out of the palace with Evandel. The Prime Minister, his Cabinet, and the members of Parliament were gathered in the garden.</p>
<p>“Don’t be nervous, Princess. The negotiation is looking favorable.”</p>
<p>Despite saying this, the Prime Minister was trembling nonstop.</p>
<p>“…Yes, don’t be too nervous either, Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, nervous? Never. Never, ever nervous. Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>In any case, after about five minutes of waiting, Yoo Yeonha’s limousine appeared along with an incredible entourage of guards.</p>
<p>After getting off, Yoo Yeonha entered the meeting room while receiving a warm welcome from the Prime Minister and Parliamentary members.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha replied to the Prime Minister’s joke extremely coldly.</p>
<p>“Now, let’s start the negotiation… but before that, why is there a kid here?”</p>
<p>Inside the meeting room, Yoo Yeonha found Evandel sitting inside the room full of suited politicians and slightly lost her calm.</p>
<p>“Princess Rachel?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s sharp gaze turned to Rachel.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Rachel blinked her eyes and pretended to be oblivious. Evandel also blinked her eyes and stared at Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Sitting on a chair that was far bigger than her body, Evandel found it difficult to even place her two arms on the table. Yoo Yeonha found this incredibly cute.</p>
<p>But she knew not to mix business with pleasure.</p>
<p>“…This is an important negotiation meeting. Please leave Evandel out of it.”</p>
<p>“No, Evandel is here because she wants to be a part of the talk.”</p>
<p>Rachel spoke as she looked at Evandel.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha frowned. This princess was trying to use a kid for the negotiation…?</p>
<p>“Evandel wants to become a Hero in the future, and the English Royal Court plans to support her as much as possible. After all, her talent is great. We were hoping that, through this meeting, Evandel would become a member of both a Korean guild and an English guild.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha’s shoulders turned stiff.</p>
<p>What Rachel was saying was clear.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha racked her brains before letting out a dry cough and nodding her head.</p>
<p>“I see. Well, I’ve heard of our little Hero’s accomplishments. You were great, future Hero Evandel.”</p>
<p>“Eh? Ah, hehehe…. Th… thank you….”</p>
<p>Evandel tried her best to hide her laughter at Yoo Yeonha’s praise.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha also smiled lightly and spread out the documents she brought.</p>
<p>“…Then let’s start the negotiation, including future Hero Evandel-nim’s guild status.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Korea, Seoul - Chae Joochul’s Mansion]</p>
<p>“We’re here, Grand Hero-nim.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, a voice from the driver’s seat woke Chae Nayun from her sleep. She had returned after completing her mission as a Hero.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes narrowly, She was drooling from her mouth, and tears were flowing down from her eyes.</p>
<p>The drool was one thing, but why was she crying?</p>
<p>“Ah, thanks. Huaaaam—”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun yawned and wiped away the tears and drool.</p>
<p>“…What time is it?”</p>
<p>“1:30 a.m.”</p>
<p>“Wow~ Really? I fought for 18 hours? I was wondering why I was so freaking tired.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you form a team too? It will reduce your exhaustion significantly.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Ah, no, I like being alone.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s official position was ‘Grand Hero’. It was equal to a team leader position, and she was one of the highest-ranked officers in Essence of the Strait.</p>
<p>Although she had the right and authority to form her own team, she didn’t. She completed her missions almost exclusively alone.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun herself didn’t know the reason.</p>
<p>She simply thought she had to.</p>
<p>“You can go back. I’ll go on my on tomorrow, so rest up.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun got off from the limousine and sent the driver home. Just like always, she walked past the Hanok’s front door. But today, she was roused by a certain presence.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the presence of an assassin.</p>
<p>In fact, this presence was making it clear that it was there.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stopped and turned in that direction.</p>
<p>“Oi, crazy woman. It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>From the darkness, a destructive figure appeared.</p>
<p>Terrifying muscles and protruding veins. A human monster that seemed impossible to kill with a blade.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun reached back and grabbed her Balmung.</p>
<p>“…Ah, don’t be so wary. My business isn’t with you.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong waved his hand and walked proudly to the front door.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun didn’t relax and spat out.</p>
<p>“What business do you have with me?”</p>
<p>“I told you, my business isn’t with you…. I’m here for your grandfather.”</p>
<p>“…Grandfather?”</p>
<p>“Yep. I came to make your grandfather atone for his past sins.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t pretend like you don’t know. The Kwang-Oh Incident.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun flinched. She knew what the incident was.</p>
<p>Killing innocent people to silence a political opponent, hiding all records and manipulating the media - a truly heinous massacre.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>And… mm… what was it?</p>
<p>Wasn’t there something important?</p>
<p>“So tell me. Where is your grand—”</p>
<p>When Cheok Jungyeong asked, suddenly, an arrow flew forward and struck the back of Cheok Jungyeong’s head. It must have been quite strong, as his head bent forward in a 90-degree angle.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong remained in that position for a while before gritting his teeth and glaring back.</p>
<p>“That stupid woman…. Does she think she’s the leader now?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be violent.”</p>
<p>A clear voice rang out from the sky. Startled, Chae Nayun turned to the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>A hooded archer was sitting on top of a pine tree near the mansion.</p>
<p>“Sorry for visiting you all of a sudden, Chae Nayun-ssi.”</p>
<p>The archer said so as she lifted up her hood.</p>
<p>“But this is something that must be done. We wanted to get your opinion too, so excuse us for our rudeness.”</p>
<p>When the archer’s face was revealed, Chae Nayun’s eyes became dyed in shock.</p>
<p>“…Senior Jin Seyeon!?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon smiled faintly and gazed at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Junior Chae Nayun.”</p>
<p>“W-Why are you here? Or rather, what relationship do you have with this crazy muscle-pig….?”</p>
<p>“Muscle-pig? Are you out of your—”</p>
<p><em>Tak-</em> Jin Seyeon lightly landed. She walked up to Chae Nayun, who was in a mild state of panic and spoke with a stiff expression.</p>
<p>“I know this might be sudden, but I wanted to ask for your opinion.”</p>
<p>“Opinion? Mine?”</p>
<p>When Chae Nayun asked back in a daze, Jin Seyeon answered seriously.</p>
<p>“I’ll get to the point. We plan to rob Essential Pharmacy and return ‘emotions’ to Chae Joochul.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>As Jin Seyeon’s skipped a few explanations, Chae Nayun’s already-empty head was wiped clean.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 368. The Story That Should Not Have Existed (3)</p>
<p>Three people sat face-to-face in a dark forest. As there were three chair-sized rocks conveniently placed there, they each took one rock.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon explained her plan to the confused Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun asked several questions before finally coming to an understanding.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon’s plan was to ‘oust the corrupt political figures of the Association’. Returning emotions to Chae Joochul was only a part of that plan.</p>
<p>“The Association’s executives have even cooperated with Djinns for their safety and wealth. Even knowing the dangers of the ‘side-effects’ of Gifts, they used children as a means of delaying their aging or as weapons of mass destruction. They threatened powerless countries while using us Heroes and caused wars to monopolize dungeons and artifacts.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Nayun-ssi, they are no longer an association of ‘Heroes’. Now is the time to correct everything. Although the world is troubled by Baal and the New Evils, that only makes this the perfect moment. If we let the Association be, they might begin to collude with the New Evils. After all, a clear enemy is needed for the Association to maintain their strength.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun dropped her head. Her shadow wasn’t visible in the dark forest.</p>
<p>While she was maintaining her silence, Cheok Jungyeong furrowed his brows and stepped up.</p>
<p>“Wait, then you’re not going to fight with Chae Joochul?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We need to join hands with him instead.”</p>
<p>It was impossible to pass justice on the Association with just the power of the Chameleon Troupe. Although the members of the Chameleon Troupe had incredible strength, their political power was nonexistent. Of course, Jain’s Gift would become a huge help in that regard, but that alone wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>“…Join hands with Grandfather?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun asked with a depressed voice.</p>
<p>“Yes. Chae Joochul does not have emotions. So he had to have had a calculative reason for helping Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho at that time. You can see from the records that ‘Daehyun’ was able to rise higher thanks to that incident. But their relationship can’t continue forever. And that’s because Chae Joochul’s emotions are faint.”</p>
<p>Using emotionlessness to break the pact formed with emotionlessness.</p>
<p>That was Jin Seyeon’s plan.</p>
<p>Until now, Chae Joochul had maintained a mutually beneficial relationship with the Association’s executives. If they became useless and clear evidence was provided to support this, Chae Joochul would undoubtedly push them away.</p>
<p>However, Chae Nayun hesitated.</p>
<p>“…Even if that happens, Grandfather will not regret his past actions.”</p>
<p>That was the reason.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul played a huge role in the tragedy known as the Kwang-Oh Incident. But Chae Joochul has never and will never feel sadness or guilt. Because the antidote known as ‘emotions’ didn’t exist for him.</p>
<p>Hearing Chae Nayun, Jin Seyeon shook her head.</p>
<p>“You’re wrong, Nayun-ssi. Essential Pharmacy is developing medicine to counter the side-effects of Gifts.”</p>
<p>“W-What? A medicine to counter side-effects?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Jain had obtained this information after infiltrating Essential Pharmacy. Jin Seyeon continued in a low, serious tone.</p>
<p>“The Nine Stars’ Heynckes and Oh Jaejin. Heynckes possessed a few of the prototype medication that cured them of their side-effects. Heynckes donated them to Essential Pharmacy, and Essential Pharmacy is properly doing research on this subject.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“T-Then when the medicine is done….”</p>
<p>“Yes, Chae Joochul will regain his emotions.”</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun dropped her jaw in shock but closed it in the next moment.</p>
<p>She suddenly became worried.</p>
<p>In truth, even she didn’t know how Chae Joochul was originally.</p>
<p>If her grandfather was a merciless villain from the start, what should she do? What if his emotionless state made him less of a threat to society? If he killed humans as he pleased and treated love, sympathy, and compassion as trash, then….</p>
<p>This possibility crossed her mind. However, Chae Nayun steeled her heart and clenched her fists.</p>
<p>She decided to believe in the kind side Chae Joochul showed her as her grandfather.</p>
<p>She had to.</p>
<p>To pay the debt she had to that person.</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll help.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon bowed and thanked her from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>“Sorry for making such an unreasonable demand. Even though you aren’t related to this incident….”</p>
<p>“Huh? No, I’m also…?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun couldn’t finish her speech.</p>
<p>Kwang-Oh Incident.</p>
<p>The evil deed committed by her grandfather. A tragedy that had to be made right.</p>
<p>But wasn’t there more to it?</p>
<p>There definitely should be….</p>
<p>“…Uk!”</p>
<p>A sharp pang of pain suddenly struck Chae Nayun’s head. She clutched her head and kneeled.</p>
<p>“Nayun-ssi?!”</p>
<p>Startled, Jin Seyeon grabbed Chae Nayun’s body.</p>
<p>This brain-splitting pain didn’t disappear easily. And in this pain, Chae Nayun continued to think.</p>
<p>That she had forgotten about something important.</p>
<p>She didn’t know what it was, but her heart was naturally moving ‘for him’….</p>
<p>“Are you okay? Nayun-ssi? Nayun-ssi!”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The hammering pain disappeared, and Chae Nayun blankly looked up at Jin Seyeon. Jin Seyeon was staring at her with a worried look.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes? Ah, yes, I’m fine….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun fiddled with her necklace as she met Jin Seyeon’s gaze.</p>
<p>Then, a question suddenly arose in her head.</p>
<p>This necklace… didn’t someone give it to me?</p>
<p>It wasn’t a present, so I have to return it….</p>
<p>But who was it?</p>
<p>Who am I supposed to return it to…?</p>
<p>Chae Nayun slowly closed her eyes.</p>
<p>This time, she didn’t faint.</p>
<p>She was meditating to remember something.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kim Suho stood in front of the Guild Leader’s office for a meeting.</p>
<p>[Creator’s Sacred Grace, Leader - Yun Seung-Ah]</p>
<p>Her nameplate shone in with a green light.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok-</em></p>
<p>When Kim Suho knocked on the door, Yun Seung-Ah opened it and greeted him with a smile.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho bowed with formality and walked into the office. He thought this every time he entered here, but the Guild Leader’s office really looked like a domed stadium. Not only were the walls in a circle, but the ceiling was also round and protruding up.</p>
<p>“Did you have a meeting?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked as he looked around the messy office. Creator’s Sacred Grace’s performance and ranking were recorded on the board.</p>
<p>“Yep. Look at that. Our guild ranking. We’re doing well, right?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah sat at the head of the table while laughing joyfully. Kim Suho sat down next to her and looked at the ranking too.</p>
<p>[Rank 1 - Essence of the Strait]</p>
<p>[Rank 2 - Desolate Moon]</p>
<p>[Rank 3 - Creator’s Sacred Grace]</p>
<p>[Rank 4 - Frost Sanctuary]</p>
<p>“…Essence of the Strait is practically impossible to overtake now, but we managed to take the rank 3 spot with the recent assault on Oedo Island Cave.”</p>
<p>She sounded proud and bitter at the same time.</p>
<p>Just like she said, although Creator’s Sacred Grace managed to reclaim some of its former glory, the gap between them and Essence of the Strait was no longer possible to cross.</p>
<p>“Even if they don’t work for 10 years, we won’t be able to catch up to them. Kind of unfair, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah grumbled as she brewed two cups of tea - one for herself and one for Kim Suho.</p>
<p>Kim Suho spoke with a faint smile.</p>
<p>“It’s something to be happy about if we think of them as our ally. Anyways, why did you call me?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you see…. The Association made a request. It’s an assassination order.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Assassination?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho furrowed his brows. He never expected to hear the words ‘assassination’, especially from the Association.</p>
<p>“Yep. The Association Head personally made this request. You’ve heard of the Chameleon Troupe, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“They want us to eliminate that group.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was dumbstruck. Of course, the Chameleon Troupe had committed many crimes until now. But not only did they help humanity during the war against Orden and Baal, they were also granted a pardon because of it.</p>
<p>If the order was arresting the Chameleon Troupe members, Kim Suho would have agreed readily.</p>
<p>But ‘assassinating’ them?</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked sharply, “You agreed?”</p>
<p>“No, not yet. But… if we do, it will be greatly beneficial to us. Enough to make us rise to rank 2….”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah stole a sideways glance as she sipped her tea. Kim Suho felt something from her eyes.</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Rank 2. How specifically?”</p>
<p>“…Remember how many dungeons appeared recently? He said he would give us the right to monopolize the top ten dungeons.”</p>
<p>It was indeed a tempting offer. Kim Suho rubbed his chin, pretending to be in thought, before pushing his hair up and getting up.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound bad. No, it sounds tempting. But I have something I need to do right now… so I’ll listen to the details later.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay. If that’s what you think, I’ll think about it in a positive light. You seem busy. You can go now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, understood.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho left the Guild Leader’s office.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Then, he took deep breaths as he leaned against the door. At that moment, a loud voice rang out.</p>
<p>Glancing to the side, he saw Yi Yeonghan.</p>
<p>He was guiding a group of cadets from Cube while touring the guild.</p>
<p>“Look, it’s the future Vice Leader! Say hello, kids! He’s the Hero who saved the world, Kim Suho!”</p>
<p>“…Ah, hey guys.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“W-Wow! Kim, Kim Suho-nim!”</p>
<p>“S-Sword Saint Kim Suho! I’m your biggest fan!”</p>
<p>“Wooooow-!”</p>
<p>Teenagers who seemed to be in their first or second year of Cube hollered and ran up to him. Kim Suho smiled wryly and took hundreds of pictures with them.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p><em>Tik- tok-</em> In a silent apartment room where only the sound of the clockhands could be heard, I was in the middle of drinking a 500,000 won red ginseng extract.</p>
<p>“So bitter.”</p>
<p>It tasted bitter. Its medicinal effect wasn’t anything special either.</p>
<p>If a 500,000 won red ginseng extract was only this much, the cheaper ones they sold in stores had to be more or less non-effective.</p>
<p>I wrote down the effects of the extract on a notebook in front of me.</p>
<p>[Low-rank Red Ginseng - Faint vitality recovering effect. No effect on raising physical ability.]</p>
<p>Because my ability to see the system and my stats disappeared, I developed a habit of writing down things I felt.</p>
<p>I currently had 14 medicines written in the notebook.</p>
<p>Most of them were things like this red ginseng extract.</p>
<p>“…As I thought, this isn’t enough.”</p>
<p>I threw the extract away and sprawled down on the couch.</p>
<p>“Ehew….”</p>
<p>A week had passed since I regained the [Medicinal Memory Physique].</p>
<p>I’ve been living in a great sense of helplessness.</p>
<p>I would become motivated, then unmotivated several times every day. Emptiness filled the space where motivation left, and even when motivation returned, it would quickly disappear.</p>
<p>Although I could memorize the effects of medicine, I had no method of making contact with any useful ones. The resume I submitted to Essential Pharmacy’s sales department had been rejected.</p>
<p>“Geez, I’m going to commit suicide at this rate.”</p>
<p>I even had a horrible case of insomnia.</p>
<p>Every time I tried to fall asleep, I would dream about the past and hate waking up. Because of it, I was afraid to fall asleep.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>I clicked my tongue and turned on the TV.</p>
<p>—The portals connecting different countries have just been restored. Portals to America and Europe are fully functional, and….</p>
<p>News regarding portals came out.</p>
<p>“…Should I really leave this place?”</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been thinking about leaving this apartment.</p>
<p>Just like how I left this place in the past to enter Cube, I felt like I had to leave to do what I needed to do.</p>
<p>After all, this place was only the ‘starting point’.</p>
<p>In truth, I had this idea the day after I obtained the [Medicinal Memory Physique]. After all, this Physique was predicated on the idea of consuming rare ‘herbs’ and memorizing its effects rather than consuming fully-made products sold on the market.</p>
<p>But the reason I waited was on the slight off-hand chance that someone might come here. That someone might regain their memories and come looking for me.</p>
<p>Of course, I knew it was an empty wish.</p>
<p>And now that almost ten days went by, I had no choice but to admit it.</p>
<p>That ‘I’ had disappeared from this world completely.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>I raised my upper body and turned on my smartwatch.</p>
<p>Just like I saw on the news, the portal to Europe had been restored.</p>
<p>I looked at my bank account.</p>
<p>I had enough funds to travel around the mountains of different countries. I had the ‘Desert Eagle’, ‘Black Lotus Uniform’ and ‘Aether’ in case I needed to fend off danger.</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>I nodded my head resolutely as I looked at my smartwatch.</p>
<p>There was no way for me to enter Essential Pharmacy.</p>
<p>In that case, it would probably be better for me to consume different herbs from traveling and make my own medicine. Applying for a job once I had some experience would probably be more helpful.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Right now.”</p>
<p>I murmured and got up.</p>
<p>Although it was an on-the-spot decision, there was no hesitation.</p>
<p>The time to leave the starting point had come.</p>
<p>“See you, Chundong… Heh, what am I saying. I should pack.”</p>
<p>…I almost forgot.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t have the Stigma anymore, I had to pack my bags before going anywhere.</p>
<p><em>Ssk- ssk-</em></p>
<p>I picked up a luggage bag and began to pack clothes, food, my identification card, a smartwatch, the Desert Eagle, etc.</p>
<p>I threw in anything useful I could find.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 369. The Story That Should Not Have Existed (4)</p>
<p><em>Rustle- rustle-</em> I walked through a messy grass path. Weeds that grew abundantly tickled my knees, and the rocks that were littered everywhere stuck to my feet like magnets. Every time the wind blew, countless leaves fell on the ground, and the sun shone its blazing light down on them.</p>
<p>This steep mountain that could never be chosen for a stroll or hike was called ‘Yaksi Mountain’. This tall mountain located in North Hamgyeong Province revealed the roughness of nature in its entirety.</p>
<p>Due to the ‘Great Change’ that occurred in the past, it had reached a height of 2650 meters, and because of its high magic power density, it was famous for having many herbs grow there.</p>
<p>I thought about the Alps for my first destination, but as I didn’t even have a passport, I decided to come here. I planned to stay here until my passport was issued. Well, that was as long as this mountain’s owner didn’t discover me.</p>
<p>Yaksi Mountain was a private property. To be precise, it belonged to Chae Joochul. Naturally, I had infiltrated this place secretly. Perhaps, a part of me was hoping to be discovered.</p>
<p>However, today marked the seventh day since I have practically been living on this mountain. No one had discovered me yet.</p>
<p>There weren’t even patrols, which private properties often had. Wondering why this was the case, I looked up the reason on my smartwatch. The biggest reason was the war against the devils, but apparently, Chae Joochul had mostly abandoned this mountain.</p>
<p>Once I found out, I happily roamed the mountain and looked for all sorts of herbs.</p>
<p>To harvest a ‘Lion Leaf’ growing on the edge of a cliff, I climbed a steep precipice. To search for a ‘Creon’, I crossed a habitat full of wild beasts. And to protect a ‘Memory Apricot’ I managed to obtain with great difficulty, I fought with monsters.</p>
<p>Although I was physically exhausted, I was able to maintain great mental health. This was because I fell asleep exhausted, and thus could not dream….</p>
<p>“…Oh?”</p>
<p>While I was roaming the mountain in search of an herb just like always, a shining herb entered my eyes.</p>
<p>I quickly darted in the direction of the light. There, I came across a beautiful flower. A flower emitting blue light with a bud that was surrounded by white petals.</p>
<p>I didn’t know whether this flower was an herb or not. I didn’t even know this flower’s name. However, my smartwatch knew.</p>
<p>I took a photo of the flower with my smartwatch and searched for it on the [herb Encyclopedia].</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Cloud Seeker]</p>
<p>—An ordinary flower. While its appearance might cause one to mistakenly think it is an herb, no detailed effect has been recorded from it. It induces a stomach ache upon consumption.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Although this was what was written on the smartwatch, I had to try it to be sure. I changed Aether into the shape of a trowel and dug up the Cloud Seeker from the root. Then, I chomped down on it without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Argh, my stomach.”</p>
<p>Immediately, I felt a slight pain in my stomach. But when I closed my eyes and savored it, I felt like I knew the hidden effects of this herb.</p>
<p>I opened my notebook.</p>
<p>It was filled with several herbs I found in the mountain.</p>
<p>[Macorong — Memorization Progress: 100%. This herb alone has no effect, but when mixed with other herbs, it has the potential to cure various illnesses.]</p>
<p>[Creon — Memorization Progress: 60%. An addictive herb. Sharpens the five senses. Helpful for battle.]</p>
<p>[Sorrowful Sunlight — Memorization Progress: 100%. Can easily cure external injuries.]</p>
<p>[Lion Leaf — Memorization Progress: 50%. Increases testosterone levels for two hours. I felt like I became a lion, just like the herb’s name suggested.]</p>
<p>[Magic Power Forget-Me-Not — Memorization Progress: 100%. Has excellent effect in stopping bleeding and piercing wounds.]</p>
<p>[Memory Apricot — Memorization Progress: 95%. Effective at recovering memories and brain cells. Has a high chance of being used to treat dementia.]</p>
<p>I added [Cloud Seeker] to the list.</p>
<p>[Cloud Seeker — Memorization Progress: 30%. Has an effect related to ‘purification’. I would have to eat about three more to be sure.]</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p><em>Rustle, rustle—</em></p>
<p>I sensed a presence. I took out my Desert Eagle and aimed it in that direction. Soon, two men and a woman appeared from the bushes underneath the slope. They were teens who were in their late 10s or early 20s.</p>
<p>The moment they saw my gun, they screamed and raised their hands into the air.</p>
<p>“…Who are you guys?”</p>
<p>“D-Don’t shoot! We’re from a village nearby. Um, we’re here to harvest herbs.”</p>
<p>“Herbs?”</p>
<p>I furrowed my brows and examined them. The only thing that could be used as a weapon was the shovel and the scythe they hung on their waist belt. Their clothes were ragged and shabby as well.</p>
<p>Although we were only at the foot of Yaksi Mountain, they were nowhere close to ready for climbing this mountain.</p>
<p>“With those weapons?”</p>
<p>“…We, we, uh, we don’t have any weapon like the one you have.”</p>
<p>The trio trembled in front of the gun.</p>
<p>I continued to investigate without letting my guard down.</p>
<p>“What do you need herbs for?”</p>
<p>“Um, our mother is sick. We’re brother and sister. Our mother got poisoned by demonic energy. The doctor said there is no way to treat her, and Heroes won’t pay attention to small villages like ours. So, we, uh… we wanted to….”</p>
<p><em>Ebebebe—</em> The one who seemed to be the oldest of the group got tongue-tied and paused talking.</p>
<p>I couldn’t blame them. This gun did look quite intimidating, after all.</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>I clicked my tongue and lowered my gun. Immediately, the trio plopped down on their butts. It wasn’t as if I fired it. Did they have to be so scared?</p>
<p>“Your mother got demonic energy poisoning?”</p>
<p>“Yes? Ah… yes.”</p>
<p>This time, the girl spoke.</p>
<p>I fell into thought. Of the medicinal herbs I had memorized so far, the [Cloud Seeker] had a ‘purification’ effect.</p>
<p>“Hm… There was a flower that could purify demonic energy poisoning.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Really?!”</p>
<p>The trios’ eyes widened.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit guilty, I continued.</p>
<p>“But I ate it.”</p>
<p>“…Ah… ah….”</p>
<p>A hard-to-describe disappointment surfaced on their faces. I chuckled before fixing my posture and staring at them directly.</p>
<p>“But I have a medicine that might help. Do you want to try it?”</p>
<p>“Medicine? Y-You are a doctor?”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you could call me a pharmacist.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The trio fell silent. They exchanged glances with each other, seemingly mulling over what to do.</p>
<p>It should be a pretty easy decision though.</p>
<p>As I kept my eyes on them, I began to ‘assemble’ the medicine effect in my body. Separating and extracting the medicinal effect memorized by my body and creating a medicine by only taking components that helped with ‘demonic energy purification’.</p>
<p>Next was releasing it outward.</p>
<p>I concentrated the medicinal effect onto my palm and ‘manifested’ it outside of my skin. A stem sprouted up from my palm, which quickly grew and formed a fruit-like pill.</p>
<p>However, this process used up quite a bit of my stamina. Just making two of these pills made me sleepy and making four made me faint.</p>
<p>In any case, my body was now a natural pharmacy. I had developed this method of using my Physique. Since this was my only special ability, I had been thinking a lot about it and came up with different ways to use it.</p>
<p>“Take it.”</p>
<p>I threw the flat, circular pill at the trio. They jumped in a startle but still caught it before it touched the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s only a prototype, so it’s not perfect. But it will be better than going up this mountain and getting eaten by wild beasts. At least, your mother won’t be left to die alone.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, yes, thank you. We understand.”</p>
<p>“Good. By the way, do you guys do social media?”</p>
<p>I asked, suddenly curious.</p>
<p>The trio stood in a daze before quickly nodding their heads.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, we have our smartwatches, so uh… we do social media.”</p>
<p>“What’s your ID?”</p>
<p>“…Excuse us?”</p>
<p>“What’s your ID?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, yes.”</p>
<p>I took the Starstagram ID of the trio’s oldest brother, who only knew how to say ‘yes’.</p>
<p>“Good. I’ll remember this ID. Post something once your mother is cured. I need to know whether the prototype worked.”</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered the past. Back then, I did something similar to earn ‘SP’. After all, social media was an excellent source to obtain SP.</p>
<p>“…Oh, a post?”</p>
<p>“Yep. Write this.”</p>
<p>I continued with a grin.</p>
<p>“That a handsome, mysterious pharmacist helped you.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The preparation for the revolution was well underway.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun first focused on her Hero work and received ‘evidence’ from Jin Seyeon about the Association executives’ corruption, hired assassination, and other illegal activities.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stored them away safely. Her job was to amass all the evidence and bring them to Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>However… Chae Nayun was eventually found out.</p>
<p>Not to a stranger, but her close friend and guild superior, ‘Yoo Yeonha’.</p>
<p>Not even Chae Nayun knew how she was discovered. Only Yoo Yeonha knew.</p>
<p>“…That’s why I’m here with Yeonha.”</p>
<p>In the Chameleon Troupe’s cabin, Chae Nayun finished explaining why she brought Yoo Yeonha there. Of course, the explanation really was ‘I don’t know. She just knew.’</p>
<p>Jain and Jin Seyeon stared at Yoo Yeonha with dumbfounded expressions.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke while sipping on a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to rob Essential Pharmacy. After all, I am in a similar situation as you all. But there’s just one problem. Copying the side-effect cure is too difficult. Unfortunately, many of our researchers have been lost during the previous war.”</p>
<p>The recent great war had caused 1.5 million casualties in Korea. A huge wave of sorrow had swept the peninsula.</p>
<p>“So you can’t make the side-effect cure?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon asked.</p>
<p>“We’re not sure. We are looking for talented individuals, but that will take a while. Making Chae Joochul regret his misdeeds might take a while, so I suggest toppling Kim Sukho first. He already knows about our plans to attack.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha used the word ‘our plans’. This meant she was seeing herself as a part of the Chameleon Troupe. This made Jain tilt her head.</p>
<p>“<em>Our</em> plans?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Kim Sukho is also trying to bring me down with you. Something about Essence of the Strait getting too over its head. It’s a good thing we secretly recorded him. Anyways, he will attack us soon.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smirked as if he found Kim Sukho’s attempt laughable.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong asked.</p>
<p>“Attack, you say. When?”</p>
<p>“I can’t be sure, but it will be soon. Kim Sukho will put out irresistible rewards that will attract guilds and even the New Evils.”</p>
<p>At that moment…. <em>Sploosh—</em> Something swayed like water.</p>
<p>Startled, Yoo Yeonha turned around. The man who introduced himself as Cheok Jungyeong was making a frighteningly sinister smile, as his muscles twitched crazily.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha couldn’t imagine a more perverted scene.</p>
<p>She fell into a momentary daze, but soon, she realized that his excitement was caused by a competitive spirit.</p>
<p>“…But remember this. You can not kill the Heroes. The New Evils, fine. But you cannot do anything that might make you look like the villain. Only then can we bring Kim Sukho down.”</p>
<p>“Ha, really. Why is everyone telling me not to kill? Don’t you guys know that the real fun of a fight is—”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon blocked Cheok Jungyeong’s mouth.</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong barely held himself back from biting Jin Seyeon’s hand, while Jin Seyeon bowed her head politely.</p>
<p>“We think the same way. There’s no reason to kill Heroes who are oblivious to the truth.”</p>
<p>Cheok Jungyeong looked dissatisfied, but when Jin Seyeon added, ‘You can fight the New Evils as much as you want’, he finally nodded his head in satisfaction.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Korea’s capital — Seoul — the home of the world’s most famous guilds and the center of Hero business and state-of-the-art magic engineering. This place, which was the ultimate destination for the richest and the most powerful men on Earth, was currently focusing on reconstruction.</p>
<p>—We are finished with repairs here.</p>
<p>—How are things developing?</p>
<p>—The restoration process is going smoothly, but the architecture is lacking. We need time to rebuild the structural magic functionality.</p>
<p>Devils and demons had practically destroyed Seoul’s numerous skyscrapers, but the restoration process was satisfactory and quick. It was thanks to magicians and Agents joining hands to use Gifts related to construction and restoration.</p>
<p>“…Where is that guy?”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jin Sahyuk was floating in Seoul’s sky, looking down on the city. She wasn’t watching the restoration process but scouring the streets for someone.</p>
<p>The one she was searching for was, of course, ‘that man’.</p>
<p>She hasn’t seen him in recent days. As if he vanished into thin air, she couldn’t find a single hair that belonged to him even when she followed the people he was close to. What was worse was that they acted like they didn’t know him. Almost like he didn’t exist in the first place.</p>
<p>JIn Sahyuk tried to search for him using private investigators and the Violet Banquet, but all records related to him had been purged mysteriously. Nothing. Not a single trace remained as if one threw hundreds of disinfectants to wipe the record clean.</p>
<p>Although Jin Sahyuk caused a scene, asking them to find him, the professionals in this field only refused her request.</p>
<p>In truth, the problem was with Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, she didn’t know a thing about him other than his name. She had never tried to find out. She didn’t know what kind of a life he led, where he lived, and what background he had.</p>
<p>That was why she couldn’t do anything. Because she was bad with words, she couldn’t even draw a portrait for investigators. There was a person who could look into her head using Psychometry or something, but she refused to let someone like that into her brain.</p>
<p>“Son of a bitch. You hid because you really thought I was going to kidnap you and bring you back? What a coward.”</p>
<p>“…Who are you searching for so much?”</p>
<p>At that moment, a red-haired magician floating next to her asked.</p>
<p>It was Shimurin.</p>
<p>Rather than going back to her homeworld, this master of dimensional magic had stayed in this world.</p>
<p>According to Shimurin, she was traveling ‘simply out of curiosity’.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk had hired her, thinking ‘Perfect!’ After all, Shimurin’s dimensional travel magic would be of great help to Akatrina.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk glanced at Shimurin and twisted up the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>“There’s this guy.”</p>
<p>“Do you have to meet him?”</p>
<p>“I don’t <em>have</em> to, but I want to before I leave. You see, he taught me a valuable lesson I can never forget.”</p>
<p>With the humiliation of a thorough defeat, this man had broken a ‘wall’ that stood fixedly in her heart. This was the most important lesson in Jin Sahyuk’s life, and one she never would have learned without him.</p>
<p>As such, Jin Sahyuk wanted to say something before she left.</p>
<p>A conversation without ulterior motives… wouldn’t be the right way to put it. To be honest, she wanted to hear everything there was about ‘Kindspring’.</p>
<p>If Kindspring was within Kim Hajin’s inner mind just like Puharen was inside Morax, she wanted to take Kindspring with her and live the rest of her life with him.</p>
<p>“A man who taught a valuable lesson to a tyrant…. I’m curious too. Then are you saying you’ll wait until you find him?”</p>
<p>“No, I won’t delay the plan just because of him.”</p>
<p>The time for her to return to her homeworld was approaching.</p>
<p>Puharen was still scratching her heart, and the Dimension Stone Baal gave her was nearing its expiration date.</p>
<p>Once the time came, Jin Sahyuk would return to Akatrina with the food and weapons she had amassed. There would not be a shred of hesitation. She would not look back.</p>
<p>“…Hm, but Shimurin, weren’t you related to him too? Don’t you have to talk to him too?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Jin Sahyuk suddenly remembered something.</p>
<p>She had heard about Shimurin’s relationship with that guy. To be precise, she heard that Kim Hajin played a pivotal role in completing the dimensional magic.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>However, this Shimurin woman seemed to want to claim the achievement for herself, as she didn’t mention a thing about him.</p>
<p>“Who are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Like so, she only fiddled with her hair and pretended not to know.</p>
<p>“About Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered his name as if she was dumbfounded. But Shimurin still looked confused.</p>
<p>“…Kim Hajin? Did I meet someone by that name?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Kim Hajin is the one who completed your dimensional magic….”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Jin Sahyuk stopped talking.</p>
<p>A bolt of lightning seemed to strike her head.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at Shimurin, then looked down at Seoul from the sky.</p>
<p>In the next moment, she became convinced. What had been a faint, fog-like thought became a hard brick that filled her head.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin had not hidden from her. Thus, Kim Hajin’s friends weren’t pretending to not know either.</p>
<p>This entire world had forgotten about the existence known as ‘Kim Hajin’.</p>
<p>When she realized this, Jin Sahyuk naturally found out why she wasn’t affected by this.</p>
<p>It was a simple reason.</p>
<p>It was because of Kim Hajin’s secret that only she knew.</p>
<p>Another existence who was the same yet different from Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>She was the only person who knew both ‘Kindspring’ and ‘Kim Hajin’….</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 370. The Story That Shouldn’t Have Existed (5)</p>
<p>Three months have passed by since the end of the ‘Great Devil War’.</p>
<p>This war had forever changed faiths, cultures, values, and ways of living for people all over the world. As this event had an influence as big as the ‘Great Change’, the world was moving with cooperation and reconciliation transcending borders. This was because they still shared common enemies in the ‘New Evils’ and the devils ‘Leraje’ and ‘Vassago’.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as if to reflect this peaceful international atmosphere, here in Korea’s North Gyeongsang Province, many apartment buildings were lined up in a complex. They were a part of ‘Healing City’, created under the sponsorship of [Colored Paper Charity Foundation], where Yi Byul was its leader.</p>
<p>In these hundreds of apartment buildings, tens of thousands of war victims were staying. Around them were hospitals, schools, convenience stores, playgrounds, and others.</p>
<p>This 10-square-kilometer plot of land used to be a forest inhabited only by monsters. Now, it had transformed into a welfare city inhabited by 100,000 children and 30,000 adults to take care of them.</p>
<p>Yi Byul’s terrifying wealth was truly funding an entire city.</p>
<p>“Ahaha, then… would it be possible to see the Foundation Head?”</p>
<p>However, hyenas naturally flocked to money. Countless businessmen gathered to meet the person who single-handedly possessed trillions of Korean won. They added the words ‘potential investor’ to the Foundation Head, just because she was rich.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Of course, the Foundation Head refused most meetings. But 2~3 lucky businessmen succeeded in meeting the Foundation Head. By coincidence, of course. Although the Foundation Head drew a hard line saying she wasn’t interested in investing, these few meetings made the rumors spiral out of control.</p>
<p>The rumors were related to the Foundation Head’s appearance.</p>
<p>“We didn’t come here to ask for investments. In fact, we wanted to donate too—”</p>
<p>“Then give it now.”</p>
<p>“Uh….”</p>
<p>This being the case, Droon treated a son of a young chaebol coldly. The man wearing a luxury business suit was ‘Sim Hawon’. As the successor of Bingjung Corporation, he would have received appropriate treatment in most places. But in this place, he was no one extraordinary.</p>
<p>Of course, given his status, Droon wasn’t the only one who came out to greet him. Yi Yuri, who was his fiance, was next to him.</p>
<p>“…Well, I was expecting as much. Director Kim?”</p>
<p>Director Kim gave Sim Hawon a check, and Sim Hawon showed it to Droon. Although the check was for an astronomical amount with nine 0s, Droon didn’t bat an eye. After all, the Foundation Head had enough wealth to buy this man’s business and have more than enough leftover.</p>
<p>“How is it? I heard that the Colored Paper Foundation has been full of vitality lately, so we prepared this. I was thinking—”</p>
<p>“Thank you~”</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Yuri, who had stayed silent until now, suddenly stepped up. She smiled brightly, then snatched the check out of Sim Hawon’s hand.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Sim Hawon blinked his eyes and stared at Yi Yuri. Meanwhile, Droon praised her with his gaze.</p>
<p>Yi Yuri spoke as she put the check into her pocket.</p>
<p>“We’ll put it to good use. We were thinking about getting more medicine, you see.”</p>
<p>For the record, Droon and Yi Yuri were heads of security, teachers, and doctors simultaneously. They had reached adulthood and became someone who could support others while relying on each other.</p>
<p>“Uh… well, kuhum.”</p>
<p>Sim Hawon let out a dry cough. He fought a strong urge to spit out, ‘Arrogant little brat—’</p>
<p>“Then can I see her? The Foundation Head, I mean.”</p>
<p>Droon laughed at this question before replying.</p>
<p>“…We’ll think about it.”</p>
<p>His voice was laced with playfulness and a little bit of mischievousness.</p>
<p>After all, the check had nine 0s.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>After slipping away from Sim Hawon, Droon climbed a small hill behind the housing area.</p>
<p>A sky so blue that it looked like it was painted and green grass that swayed with gentle breezes. He saw a woman with long, flowing hair amidst this beautiful scene of nature.</p>
<p>She was kneeling in front of a tombstone, staring at it fixedly. Her dark hair fluttered in the air like clouds.</p>
<p>Her slim jawline, tall nose, pair of eyes that shone with a black light, and her thick, beautiful eyelashes. It looked like she came straight out of a painting.</p>
<p>Droon walked up and sat down next to her.</p>
<p>“Why are you staring at this tombstone every day?”</p>
<p>She tilted her head up slightly. She remained still, as though she was thinking about something, before shaking her head.</p>
<p>“…It’s not every day.”</p>
<p>“It’s practically every day.”</p>
<p>A gentle breeze blew. She spoke while straightening the hair that continuously fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>“…Who knows.”</p>
<p>“This person is already dead. He was an evil person too.”</p>
<p>Droon couldn’t understand why she was so tied to this tombstone carrying the name [Yi Yeonjun]. No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t understand. Would he be able to if he got older?</p>
<p>The woman smiled faintly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“It’s not this person. I’m looking for someone else.”</p>
<p>“…And who’s that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Droon furrowed his brows and glared at her. However, she spoke gently with conviction.</p>
<p>“But I’ll find out soon. Finding someone is my specialty, after all.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Yep, I’m going to remember soon. I believe I will. Without a doubt.”</p>
<p>Speechless, Droon stared at her - Yi Byul. As if she had completely parted from her past, she had changed too much.</p>
<p>No matter how rude he was to her, she didn’t react. She only smiled gently. Although her face stiffened for a moment when he flicked her forehead, she still smiled like a fool and said it was okay. Of course, this was only a punishment for a game they were playing.</p>
<p>Droon didn’t hate this new Boss. Of course, it would be a lie if he said he didn’t miss the past at all, but he knew they couldn’t go back to the past.</p>
<p>“Then… let me try it too.”</p>
<p>Droon smiled playfully and glared at the tombstone. Boss smiled faintly and offered him a seat.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Ahaha~ Here you were. Aigo, I finally found you.”</p>
<p>A clear voice swelled up from behind and entered their ears. Droon pretended to be surprised and looked back.</p>
<p>The successor of the Bingjung Corporation, Sim Hawon, was walking up the hill.</p>
<p>Yi Byul spoke.</p>
<p>“Droon, did you bring him here?”</p>
<p>“Eh? No, no, no. I would never. He must have come here on his own. But how…? Does he have good intuition?”</p>
<p>Droon shot up and walked up to the man. He planned to chase him away. However, the man had already seen Yi Byul, and his entire body went stiff.</p>
<p>He stared at Yi Byul in a daze. Then, he murmured in a fleeting voice.</p>
<p>“…So the rumors weren’t false. My god. How can there be such a beautiful—”</p>
<p>However, Yi Byul didn’t give him a chance to finish. Her shadow extended out in the form of a tentacle. It wrapped around the dazed man’s waist and dragged him away.</p>
<p>“Uaaaaah—”</p>
<p>“Oh, looks like my noona hasn’t lost her touch….”</p>
<p>“This place is off-limits to non-administrators. He must not have read the sign. I sent him there so he could read it.”</p>
<p>Looking away from the screaming man, Yi Byul turned back to the tombstone.</p>
<p>Someone who was more important than [Yi Yeonjun]. To search for him, to remember his name, she began to think once again.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>In Seoul’s Dongjak-gu Heukseok-dong was a mansion Yoo Yeonha personally built. It was fairly big and fancy from the outside. But considering Yoo Yeonha’s wealth, it was rather plain.</p>
<p>In this mansion’s main room, Yoo Yeonha was listening to a tape Hassan-i Sabbah recorded last night.</p>
<p>—Essence of the Strait has gotten too big. We should have suppressed them when we could…. But that doesn’t matter now. They will fall from grace soon enough.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho’s voice rang out.</p>
<p>—How can you be sure?</p>
<p>This was Yi Yukho’s voice.</p>
<p>—How? …In various ways. Their Heroes suddenly killing civilians, Djinns being amidst their affiliated Heroes, corruption in the Essential Pharmacy’s new medicine, and so on….</p>
<p>—Hm? There are Djinns among their Heroes?</p>
<p>—Hahaha, friend, when did you get so naive? If there aren’t, we’ll just have to make them. The new hunting dogs I found made contact with the New Evils. Using them, we should be able to deal with them easily, just like last time.</p>
<p>The moment Kim Sukho said this, a new voice cut in.</p>
<p>—…Essence of the Strait won’t be so easy. Especially that young woman, Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>It wasn’t Yi Yukho. This voice belonged to the power behind the curtains - Yoo Jangwon.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho cut in again.</p>
<p>—What are you worried about? Yoo Yeonha is too young. Plus, Yoo Jinwoong has deep relations with us. Chae Joochul doesn’t seem to be looking at them favorably either, so Yoo Yeonha will lose everything before she realizes what happened. It’s time to snap the neck of a baby hen not knowing her place and crowing.</p>
<p>The recording ended there.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was truly thankful that she had contacts with Hassan-i Sabbah. Who else but him could record a secret conversation happening at the highest floor of the Tower of Heroes?</p>
<p>“…Baby hen, he says.”</p>
<p>Besides that, Kim Sukho sure knew how to infuriate someone.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clenched her teeth.</p>
<p>She could understand where his confidence was coming from. Since he’s ruled over Korea for dozens of years, he most likely didn’t place anyone on his eyes.</p>
<p>But this arrogance would be their demise. After all, twisting the neck of a rooster wouldn’t stop the sun from rising.</p>
<p>…No, they wouldn’t be able to do even that.</p>
<p>“Sechan-ssi?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha called Jin Sechan.</p>
<p>—Yes.</p>
<p>“How is the preparation for the party going?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Jin Sechan replied while chuckling faintly.</p>
<p>—It is going smoothly.</p>
<p>“Great.”</p>
<p>This was related to the scenario Yoo Yeonha scripted.</p>
<p>She slowly turned her head and spoke to the women who were staring at her from the couch.</p>
<p>“Next Saturday, I will host a party at the Yoo family’s mansion. It will be called Post-War Societal Leaders’ Ball, or something like that. I’d like to go with a name that does the job but isn’t too snobby,”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha wanted to take care of this matter in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The coup d'etat would have to successfully round out all corrupted executives to become a revolution. Not only the chairman but anyone who was involved in the corruption had to be arrested.</p>
<p>This party would become the stage for their punishment.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha pictured the revolution she constructed in her head.</p>
<p>While they were enjoying the party, Yoo Jinwoong’s whistle-blowing would reveal the Association’s corruption to the world. Even if the executives somehow found out and tried to escape the mansion, they would be caught immediately. The reason was rather obvious.</p>
<p>The Chameleon Troupe would play a pivotal role. As the past hunting dog of Chae Joochul and the Association, they would expose the evil deeds committed by Kim Sukho and the corrupt executives.</p>
<p>Pushed to the corner, Kim Sukho might call the New Evils or his new hunting dogs. Regardless, the ‘Heroes of the Generation’ - Aileen, Kim Suho, Yun Seung-Ah, etc. - would suppress them.</p>
<p>It was a perfect plan.</p>
<p>It seemed flawless so long as she didn’t let her guard down.</p>
<p>But there was one thing she was worried about - Yoo Jinwoong.</p>
<p>That was her father.</p>
<p>She had already talked to her father. He had committed grave sins. The Kwang-Oh Incident wasn’t the only time he acted as Chae Joochul’s hunting dog. As such, it might be impossible to pardon him with her power.</p>
<p>But her father had told her that he would gladly accept his punishment. He had already resigned from his position as the guild leader, and he had even given up the coveted position as a Master-rank Hero with the excuse that ‘he felt his limit during the Great Devil War’.</p>
<p>As such, she couldn’t fail.</p>
<p>She had to succeed and make amends.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke with determination.</p>
<p>“Distribute the invitation letters. Only to the 300 people on the list. Since they can bring two people with them, about 900 people will participate.”</p>
<p>—Understood.</p>
<p>“Place our Heroes around the mansion. Confirm everyone’s invitation letter before letting them in, and once they do, do not let them leave again.”</p>
<p>—Yes, of course.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget to make sure ‘Electronic Manipulation’ is working. Jamming them won’t do. We need to make sure the Internet they see is different from the one we know. For that, you will have to set up a broadcasting station and a base station. You don’t have to worry about the cost. Feel free to use however much you want.”</p>
<p>—Understood. I will do as you say.</p>
<p>With that, Yoo Yeonha ended the communication line. Then, she turned to the two women sitting on the couch.</p>
<p>“A grand party will be held.”</p>
<p>A satisfactory reply rang out.</p>
<p>“Hehehe~ Great~ I’m a big fan of parties~”</p>
<p>It was Jain. Jin Seyeon was also sitting next to her. Unlike the brightly smiling Jain, Jin Seyeon seemed deep in thought.</p>
<p>Jain asked.</p>
<p>“Is Yun Seung-Ah coming too~?”</p>
<p>“Probably?”</p>
<p>“Hnng…. I’m not really good with her.”</p>
<p>“Won’t you be disguised anyways?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how, but she can see through my disguise~”</p>
<p><em>Kkeeung~</em> Jain stretched her arms and legs out. Then, she murmured in a tired voice.</p>
<p>“This is interesting~ It’s perfect as the Chameleon Troupe’s last mission~”</p>
<p>A bittersweet smile emerged on her face.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The plan progressed smoothly.</p>
<p>The VVVVVVIP party Yoo Yeonha hosted already became a noteworthy event among the society’s elites.</p>
<p>Although the elites amongst elites like Chae Nayun were personally invited, ordinary elites were in the position of begging the ones with invitations. After all, only 300 people had been invited, with each invitee only able to bring two guests.</p>
<p>[Jonghak said he won’t be coming.]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun received Yoo Yeonha’s message from her Hanok. Although Shin Jonghak said he wouldn’t come, she wasn’t worried. Knowing his personality, he was likely waiting until the crucial moment to appear and steal the spotlight.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Regardless, now was the time to focus on herself. Chae Nayun turned off her smartwatch and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>In front of her was a door, the sliding kind made out of wood.</p>
<p>Beyond it was her grandfather, who had far too many sins.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun had something to tell him. She had written down what to say to practice them dozens of times.</p>
<p>But at the moment, she couldn’t remember a thing.</p>
<p>No, she didn’t need to.</p>
<p>She decided to convey her feelings as his granddaughter, the feelings that would come out from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>Although her grandfather didn’t have emotions, that might just make convincing him easier.</p>
<p>Previously, he said he only felt 1% of his emotions. And 1% of emotions was, of course, meaningless.</p>
<p>But when it came to his feelings towards his family, wouldn’t 1% of his emotions equal at least 2% of emotions towards other things?</p>
<p>If that really was the case, she was in an advantageous position.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun planned to bet on this possibility.</p>
<p><em>Knock, knock</em>.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun knocked on the door. After about three seconds, the sound of a brush being put down rang out. Was her grandfather practicing calligraphy?</p>
<p>—It must be Nayun.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>—What are you doing here?</p>
<p>His voice was warm but carried something else.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clenched her fists and spoke after taking a breath.</p>
<p>“There’s something I need to say, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>—Hoho, is that so?</p>
<p>Chae Joochul spoke like a normal grandfather, one that was proud of his granddaughter for coming to see him.</p>
<p>—Then come in.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 371. The Story That Shouldn’t Have Existed (6)</p>
<p>Chae Nayun sat down, facing Chae Joochul. Chae Joochul smiled gently at his granddaughter.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clenched the fists that were placed on her lap. Chae Joochul remained still, seemingly waiting for his granddaughter to speak. The atmosphere wasn’t heavy. In fact, it was warm and gentle. Even so, Chae Nayun was more nervous than ever before.</p>
<p>Eventually, Chae Nayun opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“Grandfather, there is something I want to ask.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul nodded his head without replying. Chae Nayun’s expression stiffened. Chae Joochul hid his expression too. Chae Nayun looked into Chae Joochul’s eyes, which were as deep and dark as the abyss.</p>
<p>“Do you remember… the Kwang-Oh Incident?”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul didn’t show even the slightest hint of emotions. Chae Nayun suddenly became afraid. However, she didn’t stop.</p>
<p>“Do you remember the countless people you’ve killed, Grandfather…?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun mustered up her courage to speak. She said everything she knew - the relationship between the Association Chairman and Chae Joochul, the countless people they’ve killed, the colluding between Djinns and the Association, all the schemes used to maintain their authorities, etc….</p>
<p>The thoughts that had been suppressed by her nervousness erupted one by one.</p>
<p>“Senior Jin Seyeon’s father, Jin Younghwan, must have known. That the Association was colluding with the Djinns.”</p>
<p>As Chae Nayun continued, the light in Chae Joochul’s eyes became deeper.</p>
<p>However, Chae Nayun didn’t back down.</p>
<p>“Thinking about it, it really was weird. Cube had too many Djinns. Sven, Yoon Hyun…. I don’t know why I didn’t think about it before. Djinns shouldn’t be created so easily from a military academy with the purpose of raising Heroes.”</p>
<p>Djinns appearing in Cube naturally aroused the interest of the public and reminded them of one thing - that Djinns’ terrorism could only be stopped by Heroes.</p>
<p>Since the Djinns had Pandemonium to base their activities around, the Heroes also had to assemble around a single entity, the ‘Association’….</p>
<p>As more Djinns went wild, more people came to rely on Heroes. Naturally, the Hero Association came to hold authority greater than any other government body.</p>
<p>“…Answer me, Grandfather.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul didn’t say a word in response to Chae Nayun. Meanwhile, Chae Nayun continued to wait, hoping that he would return the reply she wanted.</p>
<p>A not-so-short silence flowed in the air until Chae Nayun’s grandfather finally spoke.</p>
<p>“I remember. I know about it.”</p>
<p>His voice was still lacking in emotion.</p>
<p>However, Chae Nayun felt a small ray of hope within these words.</p>
<p>“The Association used Djinns to solidify their political power, and I lent them a hand.”</p>
<p>“Why? Why did you—”</p>
<p>“Because that was the right choice at the time.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul’s voice carried a hint of warmth.</p>
<p>“…Right choice? You said it was the right choice?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clenched her teeth. She felt like she couldn’t continue this conversation as she felt her stomach becoming nauseous.</p>
<p><em>Tak—!</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun put down all the evidence she brought.</p>
<p>“Here is a list of all the corrupt things the Association has done. It includes evidence of their wrongdoings, including the Kwang-Oh Incident.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“They made use of Djinns, deceived Heroes, and killed countless civilians. You’re saying that this is right?”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul stared at Chae Nayun intently before nodding his head.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun flinched.</p>
<p>“G… Grandfather, you….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun pushed her hair back with her trembling hands. The words “You’re trash” came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Still, Chae Joochu remained silent and only stared at the evidence Chae Nayun brought. He slowly reached forward and picked them up. Then, he murmured softly.</p>
<p>“That might not be the case now.”</p>
<p>“…Wha?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun got tongue-tied. She scowled and glared at her grandfather. Chae Joochul continued talking while facing her funny look.</p>
<p>“Nayun, what is right and wrong is determined by the ‘era’. At the time, no one was trying to enforce righteousness. The Nine Stars, who had the power to keep the Association in check, were stuck in a rut. They were tired from their neverending fights against monsters and were afraid of their Gifts’ side-effects. Although a good balance was maintained when Shin Myungchul was alive, once he died, no one was there to go against the Association.”</p>
<p>Being emotionless meant he was thoroughly calculating. The past Chae Joochul had based his decision on what was appropriate for the era.</p>
<p>Reaching the top by becoming a part of the system, or resisting it to lead a revolution with a low chance of success.</p>
<p>The scale had obviously favored the former.</p>
<p>Chae Joochul spoke while staring at Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“But it seems like the era is changing once again.”</p>
<p>His voice didn’t have a high or low. With a monotonous, apathetic voice, Chae Joochul continued.</p>
<p>“But if the era changes, both you and your father will be badly affected. You might lose things you’ve always had until now. Is that okay?”</p>
<p><em>Gulp-</em> Chae Nayun swallowed hard. She was expecting this question, but Chae Joochul was much calmer than she anticipated. He didn’t refute her accusations nor did he criticize her for it.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun asked calmly.</p>
<p>“…What about you, Grandfather? Are you okay with it?”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul didn’t smile and nodded his head. He was clearly giving permission.</p>
<p>“…Really?”</p>
<p>Why was convincing him so easy? While Chae Nayun sat in a daze, Chae Joochul took out a small notebook from his desk drawer.</p>
<p>“As you know, Nayun, your grandfather doesn’t have emotions.”</p>
<p>Declaring calmly, Chae Joochul handed the notebook to his granddaughter.</p>
<p>“It is hard to notice that you are losing your emotions. You lose yourself before you realize what’s happening.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun took the notebook.</p>
<p>“So when I finally noticed the change within me, I set a standard so that I would never lose myself.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun opened the notebook. It only had one page with only one sentence written on it.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared at the sentence in a daze.</p>
<p>—The most important thing to me, Chae Joochul, is family.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s thoughts stopped. Her brain lagged, seemingly unable to take in the sentence in front of her.</p>
<p>Soon, her head creaked up and her gaze landed on Chae Joochul who looked just as emotionless as ever.</p>
<p>“This sentence is quite alien to me. I cannot even remember what thoughts I had when I wrote this sentence.”</p>
<p>But why was it?</p>
<p>“But your grandfather isn’t someone who uses the word ‘family’ often. That, I remember.”</p>
<p>Why was Chae Nayun feeling warmth from the aged wrinkles on her grandfather’s emotionless face?</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[March 28th — Essence of the Strait, Chief Officer’s Office]</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yoo Yeonha was sitting at her desk, inspecting the plan once again. There were too many variables to consider. Although Kim Sukho didn’t seem to be suspecting anything according to Hassan-i Sabbah, she couldn’t relax.</p>
<p>From the moment she sent the invitation letters out, she was unable to sleep. She subsisted, using all sorts of fatigue recovering medicine and Tower of Wish Skills. She would rather ruin her body while she was alive than regret things in the grave.</p>
<p>—Chief Officer, there is a rumor that might catch your interest.</p>
<p>At that moment, Essential Pharmacy’s HR department called her. Her sharpened senses turned lax, and Yoo Yeonha picked up the call while feeling exhausted.</p>
<p>“Rumor?”</p>
<p>—Yes, take a look at this.</p>
<p>HR sent over a social media post.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>[crwekdl] [♥]</p>
<p>[There is a pharmacist living in a cabin deep in the Swiss Alps. His miraculous powers can cure any illness. He helped cure my daughter’s incurable disease….]</p>
<p>“There is a pharmacist living in a cabin deep in the Swiss Alps…. What is this? Some sort of an urban legend?”</p>
<p>—At first, that’s also what we thought. But there are too many people who claimed to have found this pharmacist. We plan to go there ourselves. This person might be the talent we’ve been searching for.</p>
<p>“Mm… well, I won’t stop you. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha hung up without thinking about the matter too much. Then, she looked at the calendar once again. The party would be held on April 15th. Since it was March 28th today, there were three weeks left.</p>
<p>What should she do until then?</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Yoo Yeonha turned on her smartwatch. Rachel had sent a few pictures of Evandel. For some reason, she was with an eagle.</p>
<p>—What’s with the eagle?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked, unable to hold back her curiosity.</p>
<p>Rachel replied immediately.</p>
<p>—Ah, this eagle came to see us. We were worried at first because of its size, but it was actually kind and gentle. Evandel tamed it easily. They’re practically best friends now.</p>
<p>—Interesting. What’s its name?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha yawned while chatting. Her body slumped over her desk. It seemed not sleeping for a week was too much.</p>
<p>—Evandel named him Spartan.</p>
<p>“…Spartan?”</p>
<p>‘What kind of a name is that?’ Yoo Yeonha smirked and slowly closed her eyes. Her chin was already touching the desk, and drowsiness flooded in like a tsunami.</p>
<p>“Spartan… pft.”</p>
<p>Mumbling, she entered the world of dreams.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[April 2nd — Creator’s Sacred Grace, Vice-Leader’s Office]</p>
<p>“Hmm….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho was rubbing his chin while looking at the invitation letter Yoo Yeonha sent. This [VIP Invitation Letter] had been all the rage in the Hero community. There were rumors that those who participated would come to walk on the royal road.</p>
<p>But Kim Suho wasn’t too interested. There were other things to take care of, like civilians who were still suffering from the war. He strongly thought it was too early for them to be celebrating like this.</p>
<p>“I guess I should still go.”</p>
<p>But both Yoo Yeonha and Yun Seung-Ah strongly advised him to go. Yoo Yeonha even said she would never talk to him again if he didn’t go.</p>
<p>“Ehew….” Kim Suho sighed and looked at his computer monitor. There was a long list of missions on his agenda.</p>
<p>[Demons appeared in Gangwon-do…]</p>
<p>[A Colosseum for demons has been built in Pandemonium….]</p>
<p>[The New Evils’ subordinate group, ‘Iron Armor Eccentrics,’ appears in Gaesung’s sky….]</p>
<p>Even with Baal’s annihilation, Heroes had many tasks to take care of.</p>
<p>However, the missions given to Kim Suho by the Association were too strange. They were important missions without a doubt, but they were also far from the core of the problem. It felt like they were telling him to ignore Pandemonium and the heart of the New Evils.</p>
<p>Kim Suho slicked his hair back and thought about the Association. The international organization that created the occupation known as Heroes and ranked them… what were they thinking about right now?</p>
<p>—Hey, Kim Suho!</p>
<p>At that moment, a loud voice rang out on the screen. Startled, Kim Suho sat up straight.</p>
<p>—Uhahaha, look at you, all surprised.</p>
<p>A big screen popped up from the monitor, uncomfortably close-up with a particular person’s face.</p>
<p>The white-haired, fairy-like shorty on the screen was none other than Aileen.</p>
<p>“…Aileen-ssi?”</p>
<p>—Yo, it’s been a while~</p>
<p>She was just as prim and young as always. Kim Suho said with a grin.</p>
<p>“I thought you were busy playing ‘Leraje’s Game’. Is it fun?”</p>
<p>—What? Fun? I’m doing work. The Temple of Justice has to grow faster than Leraje’s guild and crush them.</p>
<p>‘Leraje’s Game’ was a virtual reality game that was taking the world by storm. It was so fun that there were people who had given up on real life to spend all their time in that world.</p>
<p>“Really? Well, why did you call me?”</p>
<p>—Ah, it’s nothing much. I was just wondering if you were participating in that party.</p>
<p>It seemed she was talking about Yoo Yeonha’s VIP party.</p>
<p>Kim Suho replied simply.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m participating.”</p>
<p>—Uun~ I see.</p>
<p>—Aigo~ Suho-ssi. It’s been a while~</p>
<p>Yi Yongha peeked his head in from the side. He wasn’t the only one. Kim Suho also caught a glimpse of Nicholas. It seemed the members of the Temple of Justice all logged out from Leraje’s Game.</p>
<p>“Are you all coming to the party?”</p>
<p>—Yes, of course.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll see you there.”</p>
<p>—Yes. Also, you should try out this game too. It’s incredibly fun-</p>
<p>—Ah, move!</p>
<p>Aileen shoved Yi Yongha’s face out of frame.</p>
<p>—Anyways, we were planning on a reunion. Chae Nayun, Old Man Heynckes, Rachel, and everyone else who fought against Baal…. What?! An attack?! Those fuckers! Ah, we’re hanging up! Guys, we’re logging in!</p>
<p>Something must have happened in the game as Aileen hung up angrily.</p>
<p>“…They must be pretty busy, huh.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho looked at the blackened screen and shrugged. Just as he was about to return to work…</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>The wind blew from the back. A chilling air grazed his neck.</p>
<p>‘Didn’t I have the window closed?’ Kim Suho tilted his head and turned back.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho’s eyes widened. An unexpected guest was standing there.</p>
<p>“Oi, Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was staring at him, waggling her long, slender finger.</p>
<p>A strange smile emerged on her face, making Kim Suho listless. He hadn’t seen her for a while, so he had thought she went back to Akatrina.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk smirked.</p>
<p>“That party sounds pretty fun. Why don’t you bring me too?”</p>
<p>Before Kim Suho could say a word, Jin Sahyuk added.</p>
<p>“Of course, you can’t say no.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 372. The Story That Shouldn’t Have Existed (7)</p>
<p>[April 4th - Portal Station]</p>
<p>Rachel arrived in Korea through the international portal. Evandel accompanied her as well.</p>
<p>Rachel was dressed in an ordinary business suit, but Evandel was wearing her magician’s hat and cane. Her fashion clearly screamed, “I’m a magician!”</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, everyone’s gazes fell on them the moment they left the VIP pathway. Civilians who recognized Rachel began to take pictures on their smartwatches.</p>
<p>But before they could take more than one or two photos, Essence of the Strait’s guards showed up. They quickly guided Rachel and Evandel to their limousine.</p>
<p>“We hope you have a safe trip.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Rachel got on the limousine after receiving a warm greeting from the guards. To her surprise, there was someone waiting for her inside.</p>
<p>When Rachel met this person’s eyes, she flinched.</p>
<p>If anything, she expected Yoo Yeonha to come meet her. However, the person in question was Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>“Yo.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun spoke with a grin. Rachel nodded without saying much, but Evandel trembled as soon as she saw Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>She was practically having a seizure.</p>
<p>“Fufu, Evandel, you look cute today too.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun’s smirk terrified Evandel.</p>
<p>“Anyways, hurry on in. There’s something important I need to tell you.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Rachel glanced at Evandel and saw her hesitating. Then, Chae Nayun reached forward and pulled on Evandel’s small wrist.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t do anything bad.”</p>
<p>“Huaaang!”</p>
<p>Evandel’s resistance didn’t work on Chae Nayun. Binding Evandel with her supernatural strength, Chae Nayun spoke to Rachel.</p>
<p>“You got the invitation letter to the party, right?”</p>
<p>Rachel nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Don’t bring Evandel.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Rachel tilted her head. The reason she had brought Evandel to Korea wasn’t just to visit Essence of the Strait but also to make her attract international investors. After all, Evandel needed an astronomical level of financial resources to further advance her already incredible spirit beast magic.</p>
<p>“We decided to invest in Evandel’s stronghold and research costs, so don’t worry about that.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun spoke as if she knew what Rachel was worried about.</p>
<p>But at that moment, Chae Nayun suddenly pointed at Rachel’s feet.</p>
<p>“Wait, what’s up with that bird? Where did it come from?”</p>
<p>Rachel’s gaze followed Chae Nayun’s and landed on her feet. A bird was sleeping soundly like a coiled-up snake.</p>
<p>‘He followed me all the way here?’ Rachel smiled faintly and answered.</p>
<p>“This is Spartan.”</p>
<p>“…Oh, this is Spartan?”</p>
<p>“Mhm.”</p>
<p>“Where did you find him? He looks like an eagle.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but I’m also curious. So is Evandel.”</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>Rachel stared at Spartan with a gentle gaze. Looking at him, she felt a mysterious warmth welling up from her heart. She wasn’t sure why, but she didn’t hate it. In fact, this feeling made her feel cozy and comfortable, almost like finding a precious item that had been lost.</p>
<p>“…What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun furrowed her brows as she looked back and forth between Spartan and Rachel. However, Rachel didn’t say anything more.</p>
<p>Evandel picked Spartan up and held him in her embrace.</p>
<p>“Spartan, be careful of this Unni….”</p>
<p>“What’d you say? He has nothing to worry about. You want me to hug you more?”</p>
<p>“Ah, n-no!”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>I settled down in the Swiss Alps. The scenery I’ve only seen in the movies was more beautiful than I imagined. I could barely take my eyes off the sight.</p>
<p>The mountain range revealed nature clearer than anywhere else in the world. I had been calling this place home for the past three weeks, looking up at the blue sky, the green fields, and the white snowy mountains.</p>
<p>I made a little cabin for myself here with the help of Aether. Although it wasn’t easy, Aether made it spacious enough for one person to live comfortably.</p>
<p>I began my journey of wandering around the Alps using this cabin at the end of a cliff as my home base. I found herbs to record in my body, and once every day, I manifested a medicinal pill and stored it in a pill bottle.</p>
<p>As I spent more and more time like this, the number of people finding my cabin increased. Most of them were tourists, hikers, martial artists, or explorers.</p>
<p>At first, they only looked at the cabin from afar. But after about a month, one courageous group finally knocked on my cabin door.</p>
<p>I opened the door and greeted them. They had been injured while climbing the mountain. One person had been bitten by a poisonous snake, necrosis now progressing in his leg. Another person had his shoulder bone crushed.</p>
<p>While talking to them, I introduced myself as a ‘pharmacist’. They asked for help, and I gave them pills to treat their injuries.</p>
<p>The next day, they left the cabin, now fully recovered.</p>
<p>After that, rumors of a ‘Cliff’s End Pharmacist’ spread.</p>
<p>But there weren’t many visitors. As getting here was quite dangerous in itself… many of them probably gave up in the middle of the journey.</p>
<p>“…You’ll get better with this.”</p>
<p>However, a small child came to visit me today. This child who had the dream of becoming a Hero told me that his younger sister was ill. When I asked what her symptoms were, he said it was osteosarcoma, a type of cancer that produces immature bones.</p>
<p>I gave him a pill that could eliminate the cancer cells. This pill was named Cloud’s Touch. When consumed, the magic power within the pill would race through one’s veins and eliminate all cancer cells.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!”</p>
<p>The child said thank you in crude Korean and left.</p>
<p>He had also given me a dagger as payment for the pill. Apparently, it was a treasure passed down in his family. I put it in my storage without checking to see its authenticity.</p>
<p>For the record, I had gathered about a billion won as payment for all the pills I produced. Although I never asked for compensation, a strange rumor spread that ‘the Cliff’s End Pharmacist took the patient’s precious object as payment.’</p>
<p>The occasional patients who came to visit me were often rich. Naturally, their precious objects were incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>In any case, I was alone once again. With a sigh, I looked out the window.</p>
<p>The Alps scenery was as beautiful as always. However, I was slowly getting used to this beauty.</p>
<p>Eventually, a year would go by, then two, then three…</p>
<p>What would I be doing then?</p>
<p>What would be I seeking in life?</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling frustrated, I turned on my smartwatch. After checking out ordinary community forums, I access Violet Banquet. With so much time on my hand, surfing the Internet became my blissful routine.</p>
<p>[Do you think it’s possible for someone to infiltrate the VIP party?]</p>
<p>[It would be easier to just buy a slot with money….]</p>
<p>Violet Banquet was filled with posts regarding the VIP party Yoo Yeonha was hosting. People trying to create fake invitation letters, people trying to buy invitation letters, people guessing how much it would cost just to be a guest invited by the invitees, etc….</p>
<p>“…Ehew.”</p>
<p>Looking at this made me even more frustrated. If I could attend this party… if they saw my face… would they be able to remember me?</p>
<p>…As of now, it was only false hope.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be able to say a word in front of them, and they wouldn’t be able to remember me either.</p>
<p>What I had to do was clear.</p>
<p>I had to ‘forget’, just like them.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>I shot up hearing the knocking noise. Having more than one visitor a day was unusual.</p>
<p>I opened the door. Under the sky that was getting dark, five men wearing suits were standing there. I immediately became alert, but when I saw one person’s face, I became dazed.</p>
<p>He was familiar to me.</p>
<p>He didn’t know me, but I knew him.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>While I stood in a daze, he bowed respectfully.</p>
<p>“My name is Jin Sechan. We’re from Essential Pharmacy. Would you happen to be the Cliff’s End Pharmacist?”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[April 15th - Yoo Family’s mansion]</p>
<p>“Haa….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha took a deep breath in front of the main room door. Her heart was pounding loudly.</p>
<p>Past this door was her father. What could he be thinking about? Was he afraid too? Or had he accepted his fate and was resenting his daughter?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clenched her teeth and slowly opened the door after a knock.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>From the slowly widening gap, she saw Yoo Jinwoong’s back. He seemed to be organizing documents.</p>
<p>Feeling Yoo Yeonha’s presence, Yoo Jinwoong turned around and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“Aigo, you’re here.”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong treated her as he always did.</p>
<p>However, Yoo Yeonha couldn’t smile. How could she? After all, the time for their farewell was approaching.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“…It’s fine, Yeonha.”</p>
<p>When Yoo Yeonha kept staring at him, Yoo Jinwoong spoke first. He smiled mischievously like a teen boy.</p>
<p>“Even if I’m incarcerated, you’ll still have your mother. She’s more proud of you right now than she is of me. I’m sure you won’t even notice a troublemaker like me disappearing.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had yet to tell her mother about her plan. It was better that fewer people knew about her plan.</p>
<p>“…Are you okay, Father?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked carefully.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong lightly smiled and nodded, as if she shouldn’t even ask such a question.</p>
<p>“Of course. In fact, I’m happy I have the chance to do this.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha didn’t answer. As Yoo Jinwoong’s daughter, she knew what his dreams were - becoming a Master-rank Hero, being respected by everyone in the world, and becoming an idol for children with the dream of becoming a Hero.</p>
<p>But after today, his dreams would be thoroughly crushed. His name would be disgraced for eternity.</p>
<p>“…Yeonha.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Yoo Yeonha’s complexion wasn’t getting better, Yoo Jinwoong put on a more serious face. Then, he spoke calmly.</p>
<p>“I’ve been living with regrets my whole life. About the Kwang-Oh Incident and everything else I’ve done. But there was one time when I did what my conscience told me to do.”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong slowly closed his eyes as if he was recalling something from the distant past.</p>
<p>“Because of you, I saved a child. Right. The one who saved him wasn’t me… but you. So I will listen to you this time too. The conscience that holds me true to myself… is you, Yeonha.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shut her mouth. She felt like tears were welling up, but she held them back.</p>
<p>If she cried, it would be disastrous.</p>
<p>She couldn’t mix personal feelings with business.</p>
<p>As such, she began to think about something else.</p>
<p>The ‘child’ Yoo Jinwoong mentioned.</p>
<p>Who was this ‘child’?</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked with a tearful voice.</p>
<p>“…That child. Do you think he’s still alive?”</p>
<p>“Probably. He’s the same age as you, Yeonha. I’m sure he’s living a wonderful life.”</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong walked toward her with a suitcase in his hand.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha watched him in a daze.</p>
<p>“So Yeonha, don’t give up. And don’t be sad.”</p>
<p>Next, Yoo Jinwoong placed his hand on Yoo Yeonha’s head.</p>
<p>Feeling his big, warm hand, Yoo Yeonha dropped her head. She didn’t want him to find out that she was crying.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yoo Jinwoong thought the same thing. He patted his daughter a couple of times, then left with the words “Thank you—”</p>
<p>Left alone, Yoo Yeonha stood still for a while.</p>
<p>All sorts of thoughts swirled inside her head.</p>
<p>However, she knew she didn’t have time to ponder leisurely.</p>
<p>“Oi, the party’s starting soon~”</p>
<p>Jain’s clear voice awakened Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha wiped away the tears pooling around her eyes and turned around. Jain, who was disguised as Yoo Jinwoong, was staring at her.</p>
<p>“I have to greet people like this, then leave a bit later, right~?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha nodded before going back out to the hallway and looking out the window. Limousines carrying the world’s elites were arriving one by one.</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Ok~ Huhum. Kuhuhum. Huhum… Yeonha, is my voice okay?”</p>
<p>Jain changed her voice with a few coughs. She sounded just like Yoo Jinwoong.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha fought hard to fend off the goosebumps rising on her back.</p>
<p>“You sound just like him.”</p>
<p>Saying this, she checked her outfit one final time. Her dress, bridgette, ring, hair, makeup…. Everything was perfect.</p>
<p>She was perfect as the host of the party.</p>
<p>“I’m ready. What about you guys?”</p>
<p>“We’re ready too. Khalifa will come back after dropping your father off~”</p>
<p>“Perfect.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, the time to put an end to this had come.</p>
<p>Now that humanity had come out victorious in the Great Devil War, this was the time for them to change forever. The first step would be to settle the past era’s corruption….</p>
<p>—Master, Yi Yukho and Kim Sukho are coming. It seems they will participate in the party. However, it looks like Yoo Jangwon will stay in his mansion.</p>
<p>Hassan-i Sabbah’s Mental Transmission rang out.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha wasn’t surprised as she had expected Yoo Jangwon wouldn’t come.</p>
<p>“That’s fine.”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon said she would make sure everyone received lawful punishment for their sins. That, of course, included Yoo Jangwon.</p>
<p>But that was impossible. On the surface, there was no evidence of any wrongdoing for Yoo Jangwon. Something metaphysical like ‘justice’ couldn’t apply to him.</p>
<p>As such, they had prepared a different method of punishing them.</p>
<p>“The Chameleon Troupe will be giving him a visit.”</p>
<p>A thoroughly physical concept - violence.</p>
<p>In about three hours, he would meet one of the most horrific members of the Troupe - Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>Of course, dozens of High-rank Heroes would be guarding his home, but it was unlikely that any of them would pose a problem to Cheok Jungyeong.</p>
<p>“Now then.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clapped her hands together. With this as the signal, the members of the Chameleon Troupe appeared one by one.</p>
<p>Looking at them, Yoo Yeonha smiled.</p>
<p>“Let’s start the party.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 373. The Story That Shouldn’t Have Existed (8)</p>
<p>The swallow-tail coated Kim Suho looked at the party venue. Most distinguished guests were busy talking with each other, but because he was 40 minutes late, he couldn’t join in on any conversation.</p>
<p>Kim Suho walked through the grand hall and watched Yoo Sihyuk, Yoo Jinwoong, Nicholas, and other famous Heroes. He found it rather intriguing that the Heroes he had seen on TV when he was young were all gathered here.</p>
<p>“Aigo, if it isn’t our future Hero~!”</p>
<p>At that moment, someone approached him, pretending to be friendly. Kim Suho flinched slightly as he turned to the side.</p>
<p>It was the former president of Korea, Kim Sukho.</p>
<p>“…Hello, Professor Kim Sukho.”</p>
<p>He’d heard from Yun Seung-Ah that Kim Sukho enjoyed being addressed as Professor. Kim Suho followed her advice, and it seemed it worked, as a smile bloomed on Kim Sukho’s face.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, nice to meet you. I heard you were late because of a mission.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my apologies.”</p>
<p>“No need. I was slightly late myself.”</p>
<p>When Kim Sukho let out a peal of hearty laughter, other distinguished guests gathered around him. Kim Suho knew and recognized their faces. Of the list of people Yun Seung-Ah sent, they were part of the so-called ‘Kim Sukho Faction’.</p>
<p>“Aigo, where are my manners? Suho, let me introduce you to them. This here is the chief of the Association’s Evaluation Department, Kim On.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Kim On. I heard a lot of you, High-rank Hero Kim Suho-nim.”</p>
<p>Kim On reached his hand out with a strange smile.</p>
<p>For the record, the Evaluation Department was the division of the Association that ranked and evaluated Heroes. As Heroes’ fame and salary were dependent on their ‘rank’, the Evaluation Department had quite a powerful authority.</p>
<p>“…Nice to meet you. I’m Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shook his hand awkwardly.</p>
<p>Next, he met the chiefs of the Administrative Department, the State Affairs Department, the International Aid Department, etc…. After Kim Suho shook hands with everyone, Kim Sukho laughed joyously.</p>
<p>“Hahaha. Oh right, Chief Kim, aren’t there a few empty slots for the Master-rank Hero position?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a few died during the war, and a few were expelled from not answering summons during the war.”</p>
<p>“Tsk, draft dodgers…. Such shameless Heroes. Too many of them are blinded by money and fame. When I was their age, people became Heroes to save one another. Nobody cared about money and fame.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho muttered unhappily before turning to Kim Suho and smiling.</p>
<p>“We need more Heroes like Suho.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you for the compliment.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho nodded his head wryly.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>With a <em>click</em>, the lights illuminating the room turned off.</p>
<p>Was it an event or an attack?</p>
<p>While everyone stood wary, a small spotlight shone on the south side of the party hall.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho and the other distinguished guests turned their attention to that direction.</p>
<p>The curtains lifted on the empty stage, revealing the host of the party - Yoo Yeonha. She acted with decorum befitting her position and greeted the guests.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. My name is Yoo Yeonha. I’d like to thank all the distinguished guests who are gathered here today. Of course, I will be paying each guest a visit to thank them.”</p>
<p>She thanked the guests for coming before cutting straight to the chase. Yoo Yeonha didn’t want to damage the scenario she scripted.</p>
<p>“First, Temple of Justice’s chairman, Aileen-ssi. Your courage became a powerful beacon of light against humanity’s war against Baal. We admire you from the bottom of our hearts.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha spoke with a gentle voice. At the same time, the spotlight moved and shone on Aileen. Caught in the middle of munching on chocolates, Aileen flinched before quickly wiping her mouth and making a superficial smile.</p>
<p><em>Clap, clap, clap—</em></p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clapped her hands first, which eventually spread and filled the entire room with applause. Aileen was at a loss for what to do and bowed her flushed head repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Next is Rachel, whose elementals saved countless people through their clear and pure powers. There must be hundreds of thousands of people who had their lives saved by you.”</p>
<p><em>Clap, clap, clap—</em></p>
<p>It seemed now was the time for pleasantries. Kim Suho clapped his hands as he watched Yoo Yeonha give her speech.</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>Rachel smiled bashfully at Yoo Yeonha’s praise, and several men blushed as they looked at her.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha continued to praise the distinguished guests with her silver tongue. Yun Seung-Ah, Yoo Sihyuk, Chae Nayun, Yi Yongha, Kim Suho, and even Shin Jonghak who wasn’t present….</p>
<p>Kim Suho felt his heart becoming warmer as time went on.</p>
<p>“What bullshit.”</p>
<p>However, Jin Sahyuk seemed to think otherwise. Kim Suho was surprised by her sudden appearance, but he calmed down and whispered into her ear.</p>
<p>“Be quiet.”</p>
<p>“Who are you to tell me what to do?”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You shut up.”</p>
<p>“…Geez.”</p>
<p>The corner of Kim Suho’s mouth twisted up. Meanwhile, the wholesome relay of praises was coming to an end.</p>
<p>“There are two people left.”</p>
<p>The final two people.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho knew who these two were.</p>
<p>The two people who would be the finale for this ceremony laughed quietly and drowned themselves in the moment. For a second, they even thought it might be okay to leave Essence of the Strait be.</p>
<p>“Professor Kim Sukho.”</p>
<p>A grand spotlight shone down on Kim Sukho. When everyone’s gazes turned to him, Kim Sukho waved his hand and shook his head.</p>
<p>“And the current chairman, Yi Yukho.”</p>
<p>A second spotlight shone down on Yi Yukho, one of the founding members of the Association and its current chairman. Yi Yukho showed the same reaction as Kim Sukho.</p>
<p>The distinguished guests gathered at the party thought this was the end and waited for Yoo Yeonha’s final tribute.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…And finally.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha announced that there was one person remaining.</p>
<p>While everyone stood in a fluster, Yoo Yeonha gestured at the main door of the party hall.</p>
<p>A spotlight shone down on the door, and everyone’s attention turned in that direction.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>A clear sound rang out amidst the silence.</p>
<p>Soon, the door opened— and the Immortal, Chae Joochul, appeared.</p>
<p>No, it wasn’t just Chae Jooochul.</p>
<p>Dozens of Heroes followed Chae Joochul and surrounded the party hall. The waltz playing in the background vanished, replaced by the sound of numerous footsteps.</p>
<p>“Let me introduce you all.”</p>
<p>Ignoring the atmosphere that had suddenly turned cold, Yoo Yeonha continued her speech.</p>
<p>“This is the Four-colored Immortal, Sir Chae Joochul.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul slowly walked up the stage.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>He received the microphone from Yoo Yeonha. Then, he looked down at Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho with an aged gaze. He then shifted his gaze at those surrounding them.</p>
<p>The executives of the Association’s departments were present.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Department, the Administrative Department, the Peacekeeping Department, the State Affairs Department, the General Affairs Department…. Not a single one of them was clean from corruption.</p>
<p>Without even the slightest change in his expression, Chae Joochul began to read the document he brought.</p>
<p>“Kim Sukho, Yi Yukho, Kim On, Yi Wanho, Jin Jaesoon, Jee Yonggu, Gospel, Meizarn….”</p>
<p>He read the names of 27 people, who were all executives of the Association. Yoo Yeonha had come up with the list after long, tireless hours of investigation.</p>
<p>“…The above 27 people gathered here today.”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul finished calling them out. He paused for a moment and looked at the party hall. The light in his eyes seemed to pierce through one’s mind.</p>
<p>While everyone stood confused, Chae Joochul spat out a sentence that instantly shattered the frozen atmosphere.</p>
<p>“You are under arrest for attempted assassinations, conspiracy to commit murder, massacring of civilians, collusion with Djinns, and other crimes.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You will be relieved of your duties as of this moment. You have the right to remain silent, and….”</p>
<p>Chae Joochul gave the Miranda Warning through the silent atmosphere.</p>
<p>The distinguished guests at the hall listened to Chae Joochul’s dry voice as if they had been entranced.</p>
<p>“W-What the hell does that mean!?”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho was the first one to shout.</p>
<p>His blood-shot eyes were glaring at Chae Joochul.</p>
<p>“Chae Joochul, what authority do you have to—”</p>
<p>“It is one of the authorities you gave to play up the Nine Stars.”</p>
<p>A deep voice cut off Kim Sukho’s frantic shouting.</p>
<p>Soon, another person walked up to the stage.</p>
<p>It was an old man whose left arm and right leg had turned into steel and could not even walk without a cane - Heynckes.</p>
<p>“The Authorities of the Nine Stars. I’m sure you’ve heard of it.”</p>
<p>Heynckes grinned and looked back and forth between Yi Yukho and Kim Sukho.</p>
<p>“Each member of the Nine Stars has authority equivalent to an international investigative agency…. Isn’t that the clause you personally wrote? Joochul here is an investigator I hired.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho roared in fury.</p>
<p>“Chae, Chae Joochul—! Do you think you can get away with this!?”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho shouted desperately. Heynckes might be difficult, but he planned to bring Chae Joochul down with him. Given their history together, Kim Sukho had a lot to reveal.</p>
<p>However, in the next moment, Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho had no choice but to shut their mouths.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap—</em></p>
<p>The man who followed Chae Joochul up the stage had stopped their shouting.</p>
<p>“This is proof.”</p>
<p>The man who said this… was one of the three authority-holders of the Association, ‘Yoo Jangwon’.</p>
<p>Yoo Jangwon handed Chae Joochul an envelope filled with evidence.</p>
<p>“Everything is inside this envelope.”</p>
<p>“…You, you…!”</p>
<p>As expected of a seasoned politician, Kim Sukho quickly realized what was going on.</p>
<p>Yoo Jangwon and Chae Joochul had betrayed him.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho shook. However, Yoo Jangwon ignored them like dogs on the street and continued.</p>
<p>“The Kwang-Oh Incident, Leork Incident, Augsburg Collapse Incident, and other big and small incidents caused by Djinns… all of them are incidents masterminded by those two to keep their authority. The evidence is already being broadcasted all over the world.”</p>
<p>Yoo Jangwon clapped. Immediately, a huge hologram screen shot up on the stage.</p>
<p>—I am here today, not as the Hero Yoo Jinwoong, but as a fellow human being. I am here to confess the evil deeds I have committed.</p>
<p>Yoo Jinwoong was standing in front of the media - YTV, MBN, KSB…. Yoo Jinwoong was confessing live in front of the whole world.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho’s jaw dropped.</p>
<p>‘When did Yoo Jinwoong get there? Wasn’t he here just a moment ago…?’</p>
<p>After watching the screen for some time, Kim Sukho turned to Yi Yukho. It was clear what message their eyes were exchanging. Now that they were pushed to a corner, they would struggle until the end.</p>
<p>“Don’t move!”</p>
<p><em>Kwaaaaa—!</em></p>
<p>A gleaming greatsword formed with magic power separated them. Intense heat rose from the crack formed on the ground, preventing the two from joining hands.</p>
<p>This was Chae Nayun’s doing. Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho gulped at the power that far surpassed the rumors.</p>
<p>“This is Essence of the Strait’s Chae Nayun. I have been given the authority to arrest the Association’s law-breakers by the government, as well as the authority to punish and judge them in the process. Resisting will not be allowed.”</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry to tell you, but I haven’t even been convicted yet. I’m no law-breaker.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun didn’t even pretend to hear Kim Sukho. She looked ready to behead him if he made one wrong move.</p>
<p>‘…As expected of Chae Joochul’s granddaughter. She’s mad.’ Kim Sukho shrugged and got on his knees.</p>
<p>“Then excuse me.”</p>
<p>Yoo Jangwon got down from the stage using this chaos.</p>
<p>“Wait! Stop him! Stop him too! We didn’t commit any crimes! He controlled us, and now he’s controlling you!”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho shouted loudly and pointed at Yoo Jangwon. However, Yoo Jangwon quickly escaped the party hall. Then, he prepared himself to ‘disguise’ himself again.</p>
<p><em>Ssk—</em></p>
<p>However, cold steel touched her neck.</p>
<p>“…Oops.”</p>
<p>Jain raised her hand.</p>
<p>A woman appeared from behind a pillar.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Jain. Do you have time today? I’d like for us to have a little chat.”</p>
<p>It was Yun Seung-Ah.</p>
<p>She slowly moved her sword and made a cut on Jain’s neck.</p>
<p>“Uh… well… can we chat later~? I’m a bit busy right now. I have to make them give up quickly….”</p>
<p>“I can’t do that. There’s something I need to hear too.”</p>
<p>“Hear? Hear what?”</p>
<p>“Oh? You’re pretending you don’t know? I want to cut you up the more you do this… you bitch.”</p>
<p>Blood flowed down Yun Seung-Ah’s sword. A sharp pain spread through Jain’s body.</p>
<p>Jain grit her teeth and pondered, ‘Should I push her sword away and escape? Or should I hear out this woman…?’</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she didn’t have time to weigh her options.</p>
<p><em>KWAANG—!</em></p>
<p>The roof of the mansion suddenly collapsed, and countless flying monsters and members of the New Evils appeared.</p>
<p><em>Kieeek!— Kieeeek—!</em></p>
<p>Ferocious cries rang out as the scent of demonic energy flowed out. Everyone was taken aback by the sudden attack.</p>
<p>Jain glanced at Yun Seung-Ah and spoke.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we chat after everything ends~? I’ll keep my promise this time~ This is my retirement mission, you see~”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah fell silent. Soon, the sound of something breaking rang out, and the clashing of magic power and demonic energy created a huge sonic boom.</p>
<p>There was no time to wait.</p>
<p>“…Huu.”</p>
<p>With a sigh, Yun Seung-Ah let go of Jain.</p>
<p>“If you don’t keep this promise, I won’t give you a chance to talk next time.”</p>
<p>“Okay~ Okay~ I already know your phone number. So just wait, okay~?”</p>
<p>“…Shut up and call me when you’re done.”</p>
<p>With that, Yun Seung-Ah ran towards the party hall, and Jain changed her disguise to ‘that person’ to finish the job.</p>
<p>The person Kim Sukho feared and wanted to kill so much. The reason he caused the Kwang-Oh Incident.</p>
<p>The person Jain changed into was Jin Seyeon’s father, Jin Younghwan.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>[Underground Bunker of the Mansion]</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha evacuated to the underground bunker. As she would be useless in battle and as the New Evils would surely make her their primary target, she decided to leave the rest to Chae Joochul and Heynckes.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>She sighed and turned on the TV.</p>
<p>Her father’s press conference was coming to an end.</p>
<p>—I will spend the rest of my life atoning for my sins.</p>
<p>He reached out his hand proudly. Police ran up and restrained him with handcuffs that blocked magic power. It was the equipment her corporation, Essential Dynamics, invented.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha couldn’t watch her father be taken into custody.</p>
<p>She turned off the TV, with bitterness welling up inside her.</p>
<p>She felt like she was going to vomit.</p>
<p>Her heart was filled with unsatisfiable bitterness and emptiness.</p>
<p>She felt empty.</p>
<p>Was all this really necessary?</p>
<p>Was it worth abandoning her father to do this?</p>
<p>Fish couldn’t live in waters that were too pure. Perhaps it might have been okay to compromise….</p>
<p>“…Hauuu.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha let out a helpless breath and picked up her smartwatch. Then, she checked her messages to look at her past conversations with her father.</p>
<p>[What are you up to, Yeonha?]</p>
<p>[Daughter~ Father had a little drink~]</p>
<p>[I want to see you.]</p>
<p>Her father had sent numerous messages, but there weren’t many she had replied to. Yoo Yeonha began to hate her past self for not answering.</p>
<p>“Stupid, stupid, stupid…?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha was smacking her head and blaming herself when she suddenly found a message log.</p>
<p>It was a long message, but there was no record on who the recipient was. The sender was ‘Yoo Yeonha’ without a doubt, but she had no memory of sending such a message.</p>
<p>Curious, Yoo Yeonha tilted her head and clicked on the message.</p>
<p>Soon…</p>
<p>Her face became redder than an apple, and she exploded from embarrassment.</p>
<p>[Hello, Kim Hajin-ssi. This is Yoo Yeonha. Today has been a difficult day. Well, maybe not for you, but it sure has been for me.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why. The days I spent with you as my trusty ally are popping up in my head. I was embarrassed, tired, and a little annoyed, but now that I think about it, they were precious memories.</p>
<p>Right, I’m thinking about you right now…]</p>
<p>“…W-W-What the hell is this?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha clutched her head. ‘I’m thinking about you right now’? What kind of a third-grader confession was this?</p>
<p>The unimaginable embarrassment caused her head to boil and her brain to melt.</p>
<p>But in this state of utter embarrassment, she faintly remembered the ‘emptiness’ that had been formed from her forgetting.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>The reason she had cast light upon the Kwang-Oh Incident, going so far as to abandon her father.</p>
<p>“Ah…?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha pressed her temples.</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah.” Short mutters escaped her mouth.</p>
<p>Someone’s face faintly surfaced in her mind.</p>
<p>Someone she shouldn’t forget.</p>
<p>Someone she couldn’t forget.</p>
<p>That someone’s face overlapped with the most embarrassing string of text she had ever read and faintly filled up her empty head.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 374. The Story That Shouldn’t Have Existed (9)</p>
<p>Kim Suho reacted calmly to the New Evils’ attack.</p>
<p>In fact, there was no need to overreact. No demon could withstand the Authority of the Sword Saint. All he had to do was swing his sword and cut them apart.</p>
<p>Every time the Misteltein flashed, dozens of enemies met their end.</p>
<p>“Oi, Kim Sukho, did you call these guys too?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not me!”</p>
<p>Heynckes and Kim Sukho’s voice rang out from the middle of the battlefield. Kim Suho glanced at them as he swung his sword.</p>
<p>“If it isn’t you, then who called them?”</p>
<p>“You idiot! Both the time and place of the party were recorded in the invitation. I’m sure they figured out when and how to attack by themselves!”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho roared, but Heynckes looked doubtful.</p>
<p>“Mmm…. Well, it doesn’t matter. You’ll end up taking the blame anyways.”</p>
<p>“W-Wh, what did you say?!”</p>
<p>It was a scene of poetic justice.</p>
<p>Kim Suho took his gaze off them and looked out front again. There were still many enemies left. A demon with multiple arms and legs shot towards him.</p>
<p>The demon released several thin, sharp strings of magic power. Like a spider, it tried to bind its target, but Kim Suho unleashed his magic power and incinerated the strings. He then pierced the demon’s heart with his sword.</p>
<p>“Oi.”</p>
<p>As the demon’s black blood splashed on his forehead, Jin Sahyuk called his name. She looked completely at ease.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shouted back as he sent sword strikes flying. Jin Sahyuk chased Kim Suho’s lightning-speed Misteltein with her eyes. He brandished his sword to the right and calmly reacted to a sudden attack from the left by a member of the New Evils.</p>
<p>But Jin Sahyuk’s attention wasn’t on his swordsmanship but on his ‘sword’ itself.</p>
<p>“That sword, who gave it to you?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean… huup!”</p>
<p>With a short spirited shout, a fierce gale shot out from his sword. The demons encircling him were blown away in an instant.</p>
<p>Kim Suho immediately shot towards the closest demon. After destroying their formation with the gale, he was taking care of them one by one.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk asked.</p>
<p>“You didn’t receive it from someone? Then did you obtain it alone?”</p>
<p>“…Why are you asking me that!?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho shouted as he swung his sword to the front.</p>
<p>“Because I just don’t think this is right.”</p>
<p>Rubbing her chin, Jin Sahyuk stared at the back of Kim Suho’s head. She seemed to be thinking, ‘Just what the hell is inside his brain?’</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>“…No, never mind. It looks like you won’t remember for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p><em>But I should try just in case….</em> Jin Sahyuk murmured and transformed into a cluster of energy. Then, she flowed into Kim Suho’s body. She had been making good use of this ‘inner body infiltration’ technique ever since she developed it.</p>
<p>“Wait, you….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho didn’t have the time to resist. Taken off guard by Jin Sahyuk’s sudden infiltration, Kim Suho stopped. He felt like something sharp was rummaging through his head.</p>
<p>“Jin Sahyuk, what are you doing—!”</p>
<p>He wanted to scream at her to get out, but the fight wasn’t over yet.</p>
<p>“Auuk!”</p>
<p>A demon appeared out of nowhere and grabbed Kim Suho’s head.</p>
<p><em>KWANG—!</em></p>
<p>The demon smashed Kim Suho’s head into the ground. A powerful shock struck his brain.</p>
<p>And this shock allowed Jin Sahyuk to explore Kim Suho’s brain more easily.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>“Ee, eek—!”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho screamed as he was being taken into custody by Heynckes.</p>
<p>He released his magic power desperately. His aged, worn-out magic power pushed Heynckes away, and Kim Sukho took this opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>“Kua, kuaaa.”</p>
<p>He ran as if his life depended on it. He seemed to think his safety was guaranteed if he could just escape the party hall.</p>
<p>“Tsk.”</p>
<p>Heynckes simply watched Kim Sukho run. He didn’t even consider chasing after him. Rather, he sent the frantically-escaping Kim Sukho a look of pity.</p>
<p>“Hua, hua, hua….”</p>
<p>As a result, Kim Sukho left the party hall without any hindrance and ran through the hallway.</p>
<p>“Uek!”</p>
<p>But at one point, he tripped on something. Kim Sukho flew up in the air before disgracefully falling down.</p>
<p>As most people subconsciously did, he turned around to see what had tripped him up.</p>
<p>“…?”</p>
<p>His face became dazed.</p>
<p>“Uh… uh… you….”</p>
<p>Strange sounds escaped his mouth as if his tongue were paralyzed. His head hurt, and he couldn’t continue his thoughts.</p>
<p>It was because someone who shouldn’t be here, no, someone who couldn’t be here was standing in front of him.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, President.”</p>
<p>A calm voice echoed out. The memories he had forgotten about surfaced from the deepest corner of his mind.</p>
<p>It was Jin Younghwan. He hadn’t aged a single bit and looked just like he did in the past.</p>
<p>“You, you….”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho pointed at Jin Younghwan with his finger. His body was shaking as if he were experiencing an earthquake.</p>
<p>Jin Younghwan spoke with a grin.</p>
<p>“It’s nice seeing you again. You thought I was dead, right? Ah, I might have been. Who knows… maybe I am an illusion created by your guilt. Well, then again, I doubt you have any feelings of guilt left in you. That must mean I am real.”</p>
<p>Kim Sukho’s face was dyed with shock and astonishment. Cold sweat dripped down, wetting his disheveled hair.</p>
<p>Kim Sukho stared at Jin Younghwan with a dazed face.</p>
<p>“Now then, why don’t the two of us have a little talk?”</p>
<p>Jin Younghwan still had things to say, but Kim Sukho was completely out of it.</p>
<p>“Eeeek….”</p>
<p>He eked out a strange screech before collapsing with his eyes rolled back. He even foamed from his mouth.</p>
<p>Looking at this scene with a dumbfounded expression, Jin Younghwan raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“What a coward.”</p>
<p>How could someone who killed so many people be such a coward? Did he kill people without fearing the act coming back to bite him?</p>
<p>Jain kicked the fainted Kim Sukho’s stomach before turning around. Then, she jumped slightly in a startle.</p>
<p>“Oh, you were watching?”</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon was standing there, staring at her father with bitter eyes. Even though she knew he was just Jain in disguise, sadness and reminiscence filled her heart.</p>
<p>Jin Seyeon spoke.</p>
<p>“…Please cancel that disguise now.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Oh, okay.”</p>
<p>When Jain undid her disguise, Jin Seyeon continued with a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Yun Seung-Ah is looking for you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah~ I’m sure she is~”</p>
<p>“…Are you not going to see her?”</p>
<p>“Nope, of course not.”</p>
<p>Jain smiled brightly. Jin Seyeon glared at her dumbfoundedly.</p>
<p>Jain slicked her hair back and added.</p>
<p>“She probably knew I wasn’t going to come back when she let me go~ Mm, I guess you can call our relationship a MacGuffin. Besides~ I still have important things to do~”</p>
<p>Just as Jin Seyeon was about to criticize her with the words, ‘That’s an excuse’…</p>
<p><em>Dudududu—</em></p>
<p>The sound of helicopters resounded above.</p>
<p><em>Wiing— Wiing—</em> The sound of sirens also became clear.</p>
<p>“Mm, hear that~? It’s time for us to run~”</p>
<p>Jain spoke with a bright smile.</p>
<p>Without any other choice, Jin Seyeon sighed.</p>
<p>About 10 minutes after the start of the New Evils’ attack, outside reinforcements had finally arrived.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>—This is an unprecedented exposé of corruption. The fact that the chairman of the Hero Association and the former president of Korea colluded with Djinns is taking the world by storm. Yoo Jinwoong and Chae Joochul’s confession and whistle-blowing has led to the confirmation of the Association’s executives having secret trades with the Djinns. Naturally, the Hero Association has fallen into chaos. A retired Hero, Yoo Jangwon, also stood out in this incident as a whistle-blower….</p>
<p>Pantheon, a subsidiary group of the Temple of Justice, was normally a resting place for the Temple of Justice’s Heroes. But starting from today, it was given the role of an investigative agency and headquarters.</p>
<p>Due to the sheer scale of this scandal involving countless Heroes, governments around the world realized a thorough investigation was needed and designated the Temple of Justice to be the investigators.</p>
<p>Although the Temple of Justice was also a part of the Association, the public did not oppose the choice. It was because their leader, Aileen, was far from the image of corruption in their eyes.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chae Nayun was sitting on a couch in the Temple of Justice’s lobby, fiddling with her necklace.</p>
<p>The New Evils had been suppressed, and the corrupt members of the Association, including Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho, had all been arrested. All this had only taken half a day.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had told them, “Finish this without dragging it on. If we don’t end things within 24 hours, they will launch a counterattack.”</p>
<p>The plan had succeeded.</p>
<p>…But for some reason, Chae Nayun didn’t feel refreshed.</p>
<p>If anything, she felt stuffy.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because the Chae family was involved in the corruption. She was resolved to this fate the moment she found out about what really happened with Chae Jinyoon.</p>
<p>The thing was, she felt like she had forgotten about something important.</p>
<p>And every time she felt this way, she subconsciously fiddled with her necklace.</p>
<p>However, this sense of disharmony only grew stronger as she touched the necklace.</p>
<p>Someone had given this necklace to her. She had to give it back, but she just couldn’t remember who she had to return it to. Every time she felt like she was going to remember, an unpleasant forgetfulness swept through her mind.</p>
<p>—Kieeeeek!</p>
<p>“Ah, geez!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a shriek rang out. Startled, Chae Nayun raised her lowered head. Rachel, who was sitting in the same room as her as a testifier, made a shocked expression.</p>
<p>The shriek had come from Spartan who was sleeping on her lap.</p>
<p>—Kieeeek! Kieeeek!</p>
<p>“S, Spartan? W-What’s wrong all of a sudden…?”</p>
<p>—Kieeeek! Kieeeeek!</p>
<p>He was almost having a seizure.</p>
<p>“H-Hey! Do something about him!”</p>
<p>The other Heroes, who were also present as testifiers, furrowed their brows. Yoo Sihyuk, who was a close friend with Yoo Jinwoong, scowled especially hard.</p>
<p>“Spartan- Spartan-!”</p>
<p>—Kiee….</p>
<p>When Rachel grabbed his wings and whispered, Spartan stopped. But then, he began to peck Rachel’s smartwatch. What first started out as <em>tk- tk- tk-</em> quickly transformed into <em>tududududududu-!</em></p>
<p>It was as if a woodpecker had evolved into a power drill.</p>
<p>“W-What now?”</p>
<p>Taken aback, Rachel turned on her smartwatch, wondering if she was missing something.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t find anything unusual - only a message from a connection who was set as a VVIP friend.</p>
<p>Right, the message was from Yoo Yeonha.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun, who was watching curiously, asked.</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“It looks like that woodpecker wants you to check your smartwatch. Did you get something?”</p>
<p>“I received a message from Yeonha, but that’s it….”</p>
<p>“…Yo, can you choose between polite speech and casual speech instead of mixing the two together?”</p>
<p>Rachel blinked her eyes as she often did and stared at Chae Nayun. Then, she lowered her gaze without a reply and read Yoo Yeonha’s message.</p>
<p>In the next instant, her face stiffened. It wasn’t just her face, though. Her body became as hard as a rock, almost as if she fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun perked up her eyebrows and asked.</p>
<p>“What? What is it? Did something happen?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Rachel didn’t answer.</p>
<p>“Hello? Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>She ignored Chae Nayun no matter how many times Chae Nayun asked.</p>
<p>Slightly offended, Chae Nayun furrowed her brows and turned on her smartwatch.</p>
<p>She had countless new messages.</p>
<p>Among them, Yoo Yeonha’s message stood out.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun clicked on it without much thought.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, Chae Nayun made the same shocked expression Rachel had.</p>
<p>Her thoughts stopped, and so did her body.</p>
<p>Only her eyes slowly moved up and down, reading a ‘certain word’.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>The ‘certain word’ was an ordinary name.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it wasn’t so ordinary.</p>
<p>The text message Yoo Yeonha sent had someone’s name on it.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun didn’t remember this name.</p>
<p>However, it felt familiar to her eyes.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun subconsciously clutched her necklace. Then, she slowly raised her head. Rachel, who seemingly received the same message as her, was staring back.</p>
<p>When their eyes met, Rachel asked.</p>
<p>“…This Kim Hajin… who is he?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun couldn’t answer.</p>
<p>They both needed time for deep reflection.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>—A month has passed, yet the trial is still ongoing. Kim Sukho and Yi Yukho are still claiming to be innocent, receiving criticisms from the public. On the other hand, Yoo Jinwoong has admitted his wrongs and has been convicted of multiple charges. Chae Joochul stands at a slightly unique position. Taking into account how he was one of the whistle-blowers in this case, the contributions he made during the war against Orden, and his worsening physical health due to his age and participation in the Great Devil War….</p>
<p>“…Things sure are changing quickly.”</p>
<p>I was still staying in my cabin by the Alps’ cliffside, watching TV as I munched on some cereal.</p>
<p>The month-old [Hero Association Corruption Gate] had yet to die down in the news cycle.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>In any case, it didn’t feel so bad looking at a world progressing towards a ‘story that shouldn’t have existed’.</p>
<p>In fact, I was quite happy. Not only did this world escape from the adversity known as Baal, but it was also on the brink of eliminating the cancerous tumor that was the Hero Association.</p>
<p>But this setting that the Association’s executives colluded with Djinns to maintain their authority….</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I should stop referring to things as ‘settings’. I shouldn’t even use that word.</p>
<p>After all, it only made me sad.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>At that moment, someone knocked on my door.</p>
<p>A guest?</p>
<p>I turned the smartwatch off and got up from my chair.</p>
<p>Although the world was turning rather rapidly, I was still living a life of leisure.</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>Today’s first guest seemed to be quite impatient.</p>
<p>I was about to open the door but paused for a moment. With my hand tightly holding onto the doorknob, I let out a faint breath.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but think, ‘Could it be?’ But soon, I laughed and shook my head.</p>
<p>I was mocking myself.</p>
<p>For the past month, I had been anticipating something in the corner of my mind.</p>
<p>That they would remember me and come find me — an empty hope.</p>
<p>But now I knew that wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>So, I opened the door, not expecting much.</p>
<p><em>Kiik—</em></p>
<p>The wooden door creaked open, revealing two people standing beyond it. They were blonde, blue-eyed women. As expected, they were strangers.</p>
<p>The woman on the right gulped before opening her mouth.</p>
<p>“Ah… um… are you… the Cliff’s End Pharmacist?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right.”</p>
<p>I spoke casually on purpose.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem realistic or charismatic for a mysterious pharmacist living on the edge of a cliff in a rough mountain to speak politely.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see! Wow, really, we finally….”</p>
<p>The two women cried while hugging each other.</p>
<p>“I’ll chase you out if you keep crying.”</p>
<p>“N-No! We’ll stop crying!”</p>
<p>I led them inside as soon as they stopped crying and asked about the symptoms of the patient.</p>
<p>They said it was poison from the venomous Albahara Snake.</p>
<p>Even in this world, where both scientific and magical knowledge of medicine existed, the Albahara Snake’s venom was an untreatable poison that led to unavoidable death.</p>
<p>Although the death wouldn’t be instantaneous, an afflicted victim would suffer for 3 to 14 days before finally dying.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, there wasn’t an antidote.</p>
<p>“Do you have that snake’s venom or its tooth?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, just in case.”</p>
<p>The duo were well-prepared. From their bag, they took out the snake’s venom, multiple teeth, and even its scales.</p>
<p>“We canceled our qi reinforcement after killing its mother and was ambushed by the baby that was hiding nearby. We let our guard down.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Albahara Snake has weak teeth, so as long as you maintain your qi reinforcement at all times—”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah. Alright, you can leave.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>I retrieved the materials and sent them outside.</p>
<p>“I don’t like showing people the manufacturing process.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, understood!”</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the two women leave, I swallowed the Albahara Snake’s venom.</p>
<p>In truth, detoxification happened automatically if I analyzed poison. Detoxification was one of the simplest ways of utilizing the [Medicinal Memory Physique].</p>
<p>“…Auu, it hurts.”</p>
<p>After about three minutes, the [Medicinal Memory Physique] stored the Albahara poison’s antidote. I immediately materialized the antidote in the form of a pill.</p>
<p>Holding the pill in my hand, I shouted loudly.</p>
<p>“Oi! Come in.”</p>
<p>The two women quickly came in, and I handed them the antidote.</p>
<p>They didn’t doubt my pill in the slightest. They simply cried and handed me an expensive jewel - a blue diamond.</p>
<p>““Thank you!””</p>
<p>After bowing 90 degrees, they left my cabin.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, take care.”</p>
<p>After sending them off, I sat back down on my chair and turned on my smartwatch.</p>
<p>—On the other hand, Essence of the Strait’s Chief Officer Yoo Yeonha announced her retirement, but the guild’s Heroes’ fierce dissuasion has made her retract her statement. Many people are sending Yoo Yeonha and Yoo Jinwoong’s family words of encouragement and sympathy….</p>
<p>The watch had a TV projection functionality.</p>
<p>But the news wasn’t all that interesting.</p>
<p>I stared at Yoo Yeonha having a press conference before changing the channel.</p>
<p>—The Kwang-Oh Incident is a key subject in this matter….</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>I immediately turned the watch off.</p>
<p>Kwang-Oh Incident.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was hoping that the Kwang-Oh Incident would help me. Although the memories of me were wiped from everyone’s minds, I was hopeful that someone would regain their memories once they heard the Kwang-Oh Incident. But that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>A month passed, but no one came to see me.</p>
<p>But that goes without saying.</p>
<p>It was proper for false relationships built up through the power of the author to disappear.</p>
<p>After all, this world wasn’t a novel anymore.</p>
<p>I was no longer the novelist Kim Hajin, but an insignificant Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“…Ehew.”</p>
<p><em>Tok, tok—</em></p>
<p>As I sighed, another knock rang out.</p>
<p>It was already the second visitor.</p>
<p>“Lots of visitors today, huh.”</p>
<p>I got up from my chair and walked to the door.</p>
<p>The visitors this time seemed even more impatient than the last. Or perhaps, they were more urgent than the last ones.</p>
<p>“Alright, alright…”</p>
<p>Thinking this, I opened the door without hesitation.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>Black hair fluttered in the Alps’ cold wind. A dazzling sunset shone down, and one person was looking down at me from the orange-colored sky.</p>
<p>The scenery was truly beautiful.</p>
<p>It was so unbelievably beautiful that I couldn’t think about anything.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 375. The Story That Shouldn’t Have Existed (10)</p>
<p>…I looked at her standing outside the door.</p>
<p>The world around me fell silent, but the space around me shrunk. Everything other than me and her expanded and contracted on their own.</p>
<p>I wondered if I was dreaming.</p>
<p>My body refused to move in shock.</p>
<p>This wasn’t reality.</p>
<p>Thinking so, I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>Hoping that she wouldn’t disappear and praying that I wouldn’t find myself on top of my bed, I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She was standing in the same spot.</p>
<p>I really, really couldn’t think of anything. The huge shock seemed to have fried all my brain cells.</p>
<p>So I stayed still. And I just stared at the woman standing in front of me.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I got cold feet.</p>
<p>What if she was here to acquire my pills like all the other visitors? She should have forgotten about me, so did I have to treat her like a stranger?</p>
<p>…But at that moment,</p>
<p>“I told you before, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>An unbelievable voice flowed into my ears.</p>
<p>“That I would never forget.”</p>
<p>Her eyes shone like jewels.</p>
<p>She was crying.</p>
<p>This was the first time I was seeing her cry.</p>
<p>“…I told you I won’t forget.”</p>
<p>She sobbed.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what to do. I could tell tears were flowing down my cheeks. Her crying was just as shocking as her coming to find me.</p>
<p>Should I comfort her first? Or should I silently embrace her?</p>
<p>If I were to comfort her, what was I supposed to say?</p>
<p>If I were to embrace her, to what degree?</p>
<p>While I stood around hesitating like an idiot, she approached me and walked into my arms.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>A short mutter escaped my lips.</p>
<p>Her scent tickled my nose.</p>
<p>Our clothes touched.</p>
<p>I felt like I was going to faint, but I desperately moved my arm and supported her waist.</p>
<p>“Kim Hajin.”</p>
<p>She said my name.</p>
<p>Yi Byul said my name.</p>
<p>With her hands on my chest, looking up at me like a kitten.</p>
<p>“I remember you.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I smiled.</p>
<p>A droplet of leisure fell inside my heart.</p>
<p>This person remembered me.</p>
<p>Now, Yi Byul would not leave me.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Really.”</p>
<p>I embraced her tightly.</p>
<p>She also dug into my embrace.</p>
<p>A smile of satisfaction bloomed on my face.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a dream, and I was with her.</p>
<p>…But.</p>
<p>My smile froze.</p>
<p>What if the co-author suddenly appeared?</p>
<p>What if he said there was an error and took away her memories again?</p>
<p>I looked at Yi Byul who was in my arms.</p>
<p>She was rubbing her face on my chest. I wasn’t sure if she was trying to wipe off her tears, or if she was simply too happy.</p>
<p>Well, it was probably the former. The Boss I knew would die from embarrassment knowing she cried.</p>
<p>Ah, she just blew her nose too.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>I just wanted to live in this moment.</p>
<p>Without worries, idle thoughts, or concerns.</p>
<p>In the story I finally took back, just the two of us, forever.</p>
<p>…But it seemed my prayers were useless.</p>
<p>I felt another presence approaching the cabin.</p>
<p>No, it couldn’t be called a presence, as it was simply a fierce shouting.</p>
<p><em>Kieeeeeek—!</em></p>
<p>The cry of an eagle echoed out.</p>
<p>I looked up at the cabin ceiling while still holding onto Boss. It was a habit from when I still had the ‘Master Sharpshooter’ Gift. After all, I could see through objects with that ability.</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn’t see what was beyond the ceiling now, but I had an idea.</p>
<p>“…Huhum.”</p>
<p>Yi Byul left my arms and stood next to me. It looked like she wanted to greet the person coming here.</p>
<p>Even though she was crying just a moment ago, she was now standing with dignity, like when she was Boss.</p>
<p>She turned her head and looked at me. I could still see traces of tears around her eyes.</p>
<p>“Hajin.”</p>
<p>I tilted my head. She let out a couple of dry coughs before speaking proudly.</p>
<p>“I’m the first one who came to see you. Remember that. Yep, I’m the first. The first… ufufu.”</p>
<p>She then made a pure smile, one that was mischievous and genuinely delighted.</p>
<p>With a smile, I kissed her.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>“Ehew.”</p>
<p>When the two hugged, Jin Sahyuk furrowed her brows. As someone who hated tears and touching reunions, Jin Sahyuk hated having to see something like that.</p>
<p>Of course, she had the sense of mind to not bother them. No matter how unsightly she found them to be, it was still the scene of a human triumphing over the world.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t even need to help.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk muttered quietly.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the existence known as ‘Kim Hajin’ had been erased from this world. No one remembered Kim Hajin, and no records of him remained. Kim Hajin had been banished to isolation.</p>
<p>From this point onward was Jin Sahyuk’s uncertain deduction. She guessed that, although Kim Hajin had been erased, ‘Kindspring’ inside him remained. As such, people involved with ‘Kim Chundong’ possessed the potential to remember Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>That was why Jin Sahyuk came here.</p>
<p>To let Kim Hajin know of that ‘potential’ and receive information about Kindspring.</p>
<p>But… by the looks of it, it seemed she didn’t need to do a thing.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it was obvious. The ‘Kwang-Oh Incident’ was deeply related to Kim Chundong, so those who knew about the incident should have been able to recall Kim Hajin from Kim Chundong’s past.</p>
<p>Of course, denser people like Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak would never be able to remember Kim Hajin. Because they didn’t have any point of connection with Kim Chundong, although they might realize something was off and recall a tiny bit with their sharp senses, they would never be able to regain full memory of Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“…What an unstable world.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk sighed with a hint of self-deprecation.</p>
<p>How could a ‘world’ be so full of loopholes? And how pitiful was it that she was an existence in such a world?</p>
<p>—What are you going to do from now on?</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice rose from Jin Sahyuk’s heart. It was one filled with resentment and coldness.</p>
<p>“Mm, that’s what I wanted to ask him. And also what happened to Kindspring and what will happen to my world?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes and looked into her inner mind. Inside a room decorated with care, the frozen Puharen was staring at her.</p>
<p>“After all, he’s the one who created this world.”</p>
<p>—Then why aren’t you asking him?</p>
<p>Puharen learned how to talk. But that didn’t mean he was completely healed. And it certainly didn’t mean he forgave Jin Sahyuk. If anything, it meant he was now able to attack Jin Sahyuk more directly.</p>
<p>“…I thought he was abandoned by this world, but it turns out there’s someone in an even worse situation.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk smirked.</p>
<p>As one could see, although the world might have abandoned Kim Hajin, its people remembered him.</p>
<p>With this, Kim Hajin should be able to live a calm, peaceful life.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the case for Kindspring.</p>
<p>Kindspring was born on this Earth without parents and lived a life of solitude before being transported to Akatrina.</p>
<p>Although the deep darkness inside him was partially rooted out while he served Prihi as his lord, in the end, even Prihi had abandoned him.</p>
<p>He had been abandoned in two different worlds.</p>
<p>And he disappeared without being remembered by anyone.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk couldn’t accept that.</p>
<p>As such, so that his name could be remembered forever as her most loyal servant, she planned to erect a statue of him after reconstructing her kingdom. And along with her name, she planned to inscribe his name onto the first page of Akatrina’s history book.</p>
<p>No. Before that, Jin Sahyuk believed Kindspring was alive. She believed that she would have a miraculous reunion once she returned to Akatrina.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s go back home.”</p>
<p>—…Are you really trying to go back there?</p>
<p>Puharen asked.</p>
<p>—You will die if you do. You know what’s in that place.</p>
<p>“I won’t die.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk retorted lightly and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Puharen’s cold voice came back.</p>
<p>—But I will kill you.</p>
<p>“…It doesn’t matter. If I was going to die by your hands, I wouldn’t have made it here in the first place.”</p>
<p>—And that’s okay with you? Don’t you have lingering regrets in this world?</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk flinched.</p>
<p>Puharen was right about that.</p>
<p>“Lingering regrets, you say….”</p>
<p>That was an emotion Jin Sahyuk didn’t want to admit to. But she couldn’t trick Puharen. If Puharen said it existed, it must. After all, he could search her inner mind to his desire.</p>
<p>“I’ll deal with it. In my heart, there isn’t a regret bigger than Plerion.”</p>
<p>With a grin, Jin Sahyuk grasped the Dimension Stone.</p>
<p>Puharen spoke once again.</p>
<p>—Then what is Bell doing? Is he in Akatrina?</p>
<p>“No. Bell… is doing something to try to get back to his world.”</p>
<p>Bell.</p>
<p>He made Jin Sahyuk speechless every time she thought about him.</p>
<p>He had used Baal to revive the world Baal destroyed. Jin Sahyuk wasn’t sure if he had planned for it to happen or if things just turned out that way, but given how clever and scheming he was, she believed it was the former.</p>
<p>“But Puharen, you found out about Bell already?”</p>
<p>—Yep. I will reach the deepest part of your mind soon.</p>
<p>“That might be a bit dangerous.”</p>
<p>—Dangerous? I told you. I will kill you.</p>
<p><em>Woong—</em></p>
<p>Just as a portal was created next to Jin Sahyuk…</p>
<p>A red-haired woman appeared from the wavering portal. It was Shimurin, who promised to be Jin Sahyuk’s supporter.</p>
<p><em>Woong— Woong—</em> Shimurin waved a staff she purchased from the market.</p>
<p>“Are you ready?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk nodded her head before handing the Dimension Stone to Shimurin.</p>
<p>The Dimension Stone she got from Baal was extremely unstable. It could transport only one person to Akatrina, so Shimurin’s help was vital.</p>
<p>“Alright… Jin Sahyuk.”</p>
<p>Before using the Dimension Stone to produce a [Dimension Portal], Shimurin asked once again.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you won’t regret it? If you leave, you won’t be able to come back.”</p>
<p>“No need to ask again.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk raised her eyebrows imposingly.</p>
<p>“I am a king. No one can stop a king from making her return.”</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p>Shimurin shrugged and activated her dimensional travel grand magic.</p>
<p>The mystical stone fused with her magic power, emitting a purple glow. Then, it shook violently before scattering into dust. The tiny specks of the stone rose into the air with Shimurin’s magic power.</p>
<p><em>Jiing—!</em></p>
<p>The stone and magic power formed an oval shape wavering with purple light.</p>
<p>Shimurin grinned.</p>
<p>“Now then, King, move your baggage through first.”</p>
<p>“Getting a bit cheeky there with your tone.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? That a grand magician has the same rank as a king.”</p>
<p>“…Tsk.”</p>
<p>‘Would it kill you to treat me with more respect?’</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk clicked her tongue grumpily. Then, she threw in eight magic bags filled with food, robots, weapons, armors, and other daily necessities.</p>
<p>“Then should we go in too?”</p>
<p>Shimurin spoke as she looked into the portal.</p>
<p>The portal still had enough energy. Even after moving so much baggage, it could still carry two people over. Shimurin smiled in satisfaction from her perfect calculation.</p>
<p>“Yes. Let’s go, Shimurin. To Akatrina.”</p>
<p>Just like that, Jin Sahyuk was about to step into the portal.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk paused sensing a sudden presence. They really appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Shimurin and Jin Sahyuk stopped and stared towards the cabin.</p>
<p><em>Kieeeek</em>!*</p>
<p>An eagle was circling the sky above Kim Hajin’s cabin. It was almost as if it knew Kim Hajin was there. And many people were walking up the Alps’ mountain path.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk’s shoulders trembled.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk was well acquainted with most of them. Despite not liking them, they had been through thick and thin with her. To put it more grandly, they were heroes who fought against the world and triumphed.</p>
<p>“…Haha.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk chuckled as she stared at them. Yet, she didn’t leave any words behind for them.</p>
<p>But a single whiff of wind blew and shook the Alps’ grassy field.</p>
<p><em>Whish—</em></p>
<p>The northern wind swept away the things that were there previously.</p>
<p>Silence descended in an instant.</p>
<p>The portal wavering with purple light and the woman delicately smiling in front of it both disappeared. Only the footsteps left on the grassy field served as evidence that they existed.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t lonely on the grassy field.</p>
<p>“Hua….”</p>
<p>With a deep breath, more footsteps were soon inscribed.</p>
<p>These footsteps had a clear goal. Their owners had remembered the person they had forgotten about and were here in search of that person.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. There’s no need for us to make a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>A voice rang out, seemingly filled with pleasant nervousness.</p>
<p>The wind seemed to carry a blue hue, and a beautiful sunset was cast over the sky.</p>
<p>Next up… was a reunion with someone they had forgotten about.</p>
<p>Looking forward to calling out his name, the group slowly walked towards the cabin at the cliff’s end.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 376. Epilogue (1), My Story</p>
<p>“Get up~ Get up~ Get up~”</p>
<p>A cute voice tickled my ears. Perhaps because I was still drowsy, it sounded like the chirping of a bird.</p>
<p>“Get up~ Get uuuuup~”</p>
<p>My shoulders shook. It seemed even hands this small had decent pushing power.</p>
<p>Although the drowsiness quickly went away, I stayed still on purpose, being careful to stop my mouth from wriggling from joy.</p>
<p>“I said get up….”</p>
<p>After shaking me for a long time, Evandel crossed her arms and glared at me with perked up eyes. Only then did I open my eyes. Seeing Evandel’s pouting face, I smiled.</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re up~”</p>
<p>“…Yep, I’m up.”</p>
<p>Drunk on sleep, I hugged Evandel, and she dug into my chest like a puppy. She even giggled adorably.</p>
<p>Stroking Evandel’s hair, I faced the window. A green hill entered my eyes. Illuminated by the cozy sun, a residential district was laid out before it.</p>
<p>This place was the Healing City constructed by the Colored-Paper Charity Foundation.</p>
<p>Three months ago, I came down from the Alps to this city and became an official ‘pharmacist’.</p>
<p>“Hajin, I’m hungry. I have to eat breakfast.”</p>
<p>Evandel’s squishy voice rose from my chest.</p>
<p>“Oh, you do?”</p>
<p>“Un~ Let’s go~”</p>
<p>Evandel was now old enough to be used to using casual speech. With a smile, I got up from my bed.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the cafeteria with Evandel, Rachel and Yi Byul were sitting side by side, staring at each other. Their expressions were stiff as though they had finished a serious conversation, but they changed instantly when they saw me and Evandel.</p>
<p>Rachel offered a greeting first.</p>
<p>“You’re awake? Good job, Evandel.”</p>
<p>“Un~”</p>
<p>Evandel scurried up and sat between Rachel and Yi Byul. I sat down on the opposite side, facing Evandel. Then, I asked Yi Byul and Rachel.</p>
<p>“What were you talking about?”</p>
<p>The two of them exchanged glances before shrugging and saying a sentence each.</p>
<p>“We were talking about Evandel.”</p>
<p>“…It’s been three months since I started staying here with Evandel and Rachel, after all.”</p>
<p>“Ah~”</p>
<p>Rachel and Yi Byul exchanged glances before letting out tiny coughs. A strange air flowed between them. I didn’t dig into it too deeply and reached to grab a loaf of bread from the table.</p>
<p>Nibbling on the bread, I looked around at the people who made me feel like I was dreaming every day.</p>
<p>They had stayed by my side for the past three months without losing their memories of me. Right. Three months had already gone by since I started living with them.</p>
<p>Many things happened during this time. Unsurprisingly, Yoo Yeonha was the culprit behind most happenings. After hearing that I had been ‘deleted’ from this world, she misunderstood as she always did.</p>
<p>What was it again? ‘So that is your sacrifice’? In any case, she blurted out something incomprehensible and researched how to bring back my existence.</p>
<p>It was cute at first as she started by gathering everyone who remembered me. Including Yoo Yeonha herself, there were nine people: Chae Nayun, Rachel, Evandel, Cheok Jungyeong, Jain, Droon, Jin Seyeon, and Yi Byul.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak, who didn’t know about the Kwang-Oh Incident and lacked a key link like Evandel, couldn’t remember me.</p>
<p>After that, Yoo Yeonha began to experiment. Before I could even think to stop her, she used tens of billions of won.</p>
<p>But there was no gain as expected, and Yoo Yeonha ended up offering me Essential Pharmacy’s CEO position.</p>
<p>But since I didn’t think of myself as someone worthy of that position, I settled with becoming a researcher. After all, my goal was to help as many people as possible.</p>
<p>“How is it? Good?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Byul asked. Judging by her eyes full of expectation, it seemed she was the one who baked this bread.</p>
<p>I nodded my head with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s good.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad….”</p>
<p>Yi Byul sighed a breath of relief. That was kind of cute. I stared at Yi Byul for a moment before grabbing her hand from under the table.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>An embarrassed sound escaped her lips.</p>
<p>“Kuhum.”</p>
<p>At that exact moment, Rachel let out a dry cough.</p>
<p>Yi Byul flinched and quickly let go of me, while I awkwardly scratched my head.</p>
<p>“Oh, how have things been, Rachel-ssi?”</p>
<p>“…I’m still seeking what I’ve always been seeking. The revival of England and the English Royal Court Guild. That is the reason I went to Cube all those years ago.”</p>
<p>Rachel smiled sweetly. Just as she said, Rachel had lived her life for the revival of England and the English Royal Court Guild. And as she had made great contributions during the Great Devil War, now should be the perfect time. After all, talks of a Restoration were gaining traction in England.</p>
<p>“Of course, there are still several hurdles to get through. Lancaster is still alive too.”</p>
<p>“…He is?”</p>
<p>For a moment, I was dumbstruck. That guy was still alive?</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Rachel continued with a light smile.</p>
<p>“There are still many problems that have to be resolved. In the past, I was afraid… but now, I’m okay. I’ve gotten stronger. Thanks to Hajin-ssi and Evandel.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>That caught me off guard. I flinched slightly, while Yi Byul’s eyes turned sharper. She glanced at Rachel before looking back at me with puffed cheeks.</p>
<p>Rachel added, “…Thank you.”</p>
<p>She only said two words, but I could clearly see through the meaning behind them. They were just as transparent as Rachel’s clear, ocean-colored eyes.</p>
<p>Rachel then shrugged leisurely.</p>
<p>“Thinking about it now, I don’t think I’ve said thank you to Hajin-ssi that often.”</p>
<p>“Uh… no, you don’t really need to. I should be the one who’s thanking you.”</p>
<p>I nodded my head in embarrassment and went back to eating my loaf of bread. Meanwhile, Yi Byul spoke to Rachel.</p>
<p>“…There will be a small meeting tonight.”</p>
<p>I looked up again. Yi Byul seemed to be nervous as she was glaring at Rachel with a laser-like gaze. A faint chuckle escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>“Rachel, you’re coming too, right?”</p>
<p>She sounded like she was issuing a challenge, but the intent behind her words was pure and nonmalicious. As Rachel knew this too, she smiled brightly and accepted Yi Byul’s invitation.</p>
<p>I stared at them for a moment before opening my mouth.</p>
<p>“I’ll buy the groceries.”</p>
<p>“Un?! Then me too~ I wanna go too~”</p>
<p>Evandel smiled brightly and raised both of her hands. Rachel’s eyes widened slightly.</p>
<p>“Hm? I don’t mind, but Evandel, weren’t you going to Disneyland today with your friends?”</p>
<p>“Aaah! You’re right!”</p>
<p>Rachel reminded Evandel of a promise she made with her friends, and like a true adult, Evandel said, “I guess we can buy groceries together next time~”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>5:30 p.m. As the sun was beginning to set, I went outside to buy groceries from a supermarket at the center of the city.</p>
<p>The city’s streets were filled with young boys and girls. I walked while listening to the children’s cheerful laughter.</p>
<p>Then, I suddenly felt a gaze fall on me. It was fixated on me only, coming from the zelkova tree forest on the right side of the city.</p>
<p>I became nervous. At my current state, I couldn’t even defeat ordinary Djinns.</p>
<p>But soon, the mysterious person revealed herself and eliminated my tenseness and worry.</p>
<p>It was Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>She stood at the border between the city road and the sky and looked down at me. After doing so for a long time, she grinned confidently.</p>
<p>“Have you been well?”</p>
<p>She greeted me in a Chae Nayun-like fashion.</p>
<p>I smiled back and nodded my head.</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s been a while.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun didn’t show herself after we last met at the cabin. She had vanished after leaving behind the words ‘I’m leaving’.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it really has been a while.”</p>
<p>She crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“Wait, didn’t you say you were going to conquer the Tower of Miracle?”</p>
<p>The Tower of Miracle.</p>
<p>This Tower had left many wounds to both me and Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>After Creator’s Sacred Grace’s failure to conquer this Tower, it was treated as a forbidden topic by the public. But when Essence of the Strait recently announced their plans to officially conquer the Tower, it was brought into the spotlight once again.</p>
<p>“Yep, I plan on obliterating that Tower.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun raised her arm and flexed. I could practically see the confidence oozing out of her.</p>
<p>“Pft. Yeah, If it’s you, I’m sure it’s possible…. Oh right, I’m about to go buy some groceries. Do you want to come too?”</p>
<p>I pointed at the supermarket in the distance.</p>
<p>However, Chae Nayun shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I came here to do.”</p>
<p>“…Then why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Well… the campaign is two days away. I might die there, so I thought I’d tell you before I go.”</p>
<p>She brought up a frightening topic.</p>
<p>When I furrowed my brows, Chae Nayun lowered her head. The glow of the setting sun burst out from behind her. Chae Nayun remained silent for a long time before muttering in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>“…Thank you for everything.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Thanks to you, I didn’t have to see Oppa becoming a devil. I picked up the sword because of you, and you’re also the reason I became this strong.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun spoke as if she were reciting a line she had practiced countless times. I could tell she was embarrassed since her face was flushed red.</p>
<p>“And thanks to you, I regained my real grandfather.”</p>
<p>“…It’ll take him 20 years to fully recover with that medicine.”</p>
<p>A pill that reduced the side-effects of Gifts. As I created it using Setting Intervention, reproducing it was extremely difficult. But Essential Pharmacy succeeded in creating a tiny amount, and they had been given to Heynckes and Chae Jooochul.</p>
<p>It was true that Chae Joochul regained a little bit of his true emotions, but I didn’t think Chae Nayun was talking about that.</p>
<p>“Just accept my gratitude, bastard. In a way, you’re the reason I’m alive and standing here right now.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>A bitter smile emerged on my face.</p>
<p>Looking back… it was thanks to Chae Nayun that I came to love this world. The one who showed me that this world wasn’t a novel was none other than Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>I replied, “…It’s the same with me. The reason I’m here… it might be because of you.”</p>
<p>“Is it? That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun walked up to me and stopped a nose-distance away. Looking straight into my eyes, she scratched her cheeks before dropping her head.</p>
<p>And once her gaze fell, it didn’t come back up for a while.</p>
<p>“Then….”</p>
<p>After taking a few steps back while looking down at my feet, she raised her head as though she finally came to a decision. Then, she reached her hand out. I reflexively flinched, feeling that her action was intimidating.</p>
<p>“W-What?”</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>When Chae Nayun opened her fist, a shining object dangled down.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>An exclamation escaped my mouth.</p>
<p>This was the necklace I gifted Chae Nayun a long time ago.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared at it with a bittersweet face.</p>
<p>“You lent it to me, remember? Since the war is over, I should return it.”</p>
<p>“…It’s fine.”</p>
<p>I pushed her hand back. That was obvious. After all, I made this necklace for her.</p>
<p>“What? No, take it.”</p>
<p>“I said it’s fine. Just think of it as a gift from a friend.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun paused. Standing still, she clenched her fists. Her face froze, and her shoulders stiffened.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun slicked her hair back roughly.</p>
<p>“You… you still think we can be friends?”</p>
<p>Her trembling voice trailed off. As though she was angry… no, sad, she glared at me hatefully.</p>
<p>“You should know. We can’t be friends.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything. There wasn’t anything I could tell Chae Nayun as of now. I could only wait for Chae Nayun’s ‘choice’ that would come one day in the future.</p>
<p>“Do you know what kind of a person you are to me?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared at me fixedly and made a dispirited smile.</p>
<p>“Most likely… I’m going to continue hating you and loving you. Until the day I die.”</p>
<p>Her voice was as cold as ice and as deep as the ocean. It seemed to carry an incomprehensible darkness.</p>
<p>“So, here!”</p>
<p>Without giving me a chance to think, she reached out with her hand.</p>
<p>“Take this, you bastard!”</p>
<p>“…If you say so.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>When I agreed, a shadow was suddenly cast over Chae Nayun’s face. But putting on a bright smile in the next instance, she playfully tapped my chest with her hand holding the necklace.</p>
<p>“Okay, take it.”</p>
<p>“I will, but not now. I’ll take it back after you come back from the campaign.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“You heard me. I’m talking about the Tower of Miracle. If you want to succeed, or at least increase the chances of succeeding by even a little, you’ll need that necklace.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun became dumbfounded, and I laughed.</p>
<p>In truth, the Tower of Miracle in my story was a McGuffin.</p>
<p>I did not write even a rough outline about the Tower of Miracle. I only thought, ‘What would happen if this was the reward?’ in my head.</p>
<p>So, it was extremely unlikely that the Tower’s reward was the same as what I thought of.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>If the Tower’s reward really <em>was</em> something similar to what ‘I thought’, and if Chae Nayun came to possess that ‘miracle’, would she be able to become happy again?</p>
<p>“…Got it? Give it back to me after you conquer the Tower of Miracle. Don’t refuse just for the sake of it.”</p>
<p>I pushed Chae Nayun’s fist back. She furrowed her brows, then reluctantly put the necklace back into her pocket.</p>
<p>“So fussy… Fine. It’s true that this necklace will help a lot….”</p>
<p>Grumbling brusquely, Chae Nayun turned around.</p>
<p>The sun had finished setting before I noticed, and Chae Nayun became dyed by the darkness of the navy world.</p>
<p><em>Tap, tap.</em></p>
<p>Having failed to achieve her initial objective, Chae Nayun spoke with her back facing me.</p>
<p>“I’m going. See you again.”</p>
<p>I replied as I placed her leaving figure in my memories.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, have a happy life.”</p>
<p>I didn’t say ‘see you again’ on purpose.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>—How was Disneyland? Fun?</p>
<p>—Un! Super fun~!</p>
<p>A rowdy noise woke me up while I was having a catnap on the balcony.</p>
<p>—I saw a flying pumpkin carriage!</p>
<p>Massaging my stiff neck, I looked at the living room through the window. I saw Evandel in a fairy uniform and a fairy headband.</p>
<p>—But the haunted house was too scary….</p>
<p>Her cute appearance made me grin, and I was late to notice the person sitting next to me. I turned my head and faced Yi Byul, who was leaning on the balcony’s rail and staring at me.</p>
<p>“Oh, you were watching me? You could have woken me up.”</p>
<p>I spoke as I rubbed my heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>“…Sorry.”</p>
<p>But Yi Byul suddenly apologized. Her expression was dark too.</p>
<p>I was confused, but then I realized the reason my eyelids felt so heavy.</p>
<p>I was crying.</p>
<p>I quickly wiped off the tears and spoke.</p>
<p>“Oh, this? It’s nothing. I must have had a bad dream.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>“Really. You don’t have to be sorry about anything.”</p>
<p>Yi Byul grabbed my hand tightly. Her cold hand was shaking.</p>
<p>I felt like I knew what she was thinking about.</p>
<p>After all… she was the only one who knew the truth about me.</p>
<p>Yi Byul spoke, “…You can leave whenever you want. I understand.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>I refused flatly and looked into her eyes. She was tearing up from guilt.</p>
<p>This was the reason I couldn’t say ‘I can’t go.’ For us, there was a big difference between not going and being unable to go.</p>
<p>“I’m staying here. Because you said you won’t forget me and because you came to find me first.”</p>
<p>“I—”</p>
<p>Just as Yi Byul was about to say something, the balcony door suddenly shot open, and Evandel came running in.</p>
<p>“Hajin~ Hajin~ I’m back~!”</p>
<p>After proudly boasting to Rachel, it seemed I was next. I exchanged glances with Yi Byul before coming out to the living room.</p>
<p>There were many people gathered there. Rachel and Yoo Yeonha, Droon and Yi Yuri, and even eight of Evandel’s friends.</p>
<p>“Hello~”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha waved her hand.</p>
<p>“Yo.”</p>
<p>I waved my hand half-heartedly.</p>
<p>Although Yoo Yeonha was currently the most influential person on the planet, she wasn’t a particularly rare guest here. Even if she was busy, she came at least once a week.</p>
<p>“Wait, Evandel?”</p>
<p>“Un~?”</p>
<p>“Go play with your friends on the 2nd floor. The adults have something to talk about.”</p>
<p>“Okay! Can we all play games?!”</p>
<p>“Only for two hours.”</p>
<p>“Yay~!”</p>
<p>Evandel and here friends rushed up to the 2nd floor. I breathed out a sigh, then sat down on the long table in the living room. A plate of thick steak was steaming in front of me.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha asked as soon as Yi Byul and I sat down.</p>
<p>“Nayun came and left immediately?”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>I nodded silently.</p>
<p>“Nayun-nim came?”</p>
<p>Rachel, who was sitting next to Yoo Yeonha, opened her eyes wide.</p>
<p>“You should ask him. He should know better than me.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha pointed at me.</p>
<p>“Yes, Chae Nayun came and left. She talked about the Tower campaign that’s coming up and didn’t say much else.”</p>
<p>“Ah, right, the Tower of Miracle campaign is coming up…. Nayun-nim must be really busy then.”</p>
<p>Rachel seemed a bit regretful.</p>
<p>For the record, Aileen was elected as the new chairman of the Hero Association, and Chae Nayun became the youngest Master-rank Hero. As many high-rank Heroes were promoted to Master-rank simultaneously, the honorable title went to Chae Nayun who was four days younger than Kim Suho.</p>
<p>The reason Rachel started addressing her so respectfully was because of her position as the ‘youngest Master-rank Hero’. Rachel, who was still a high-rank grade-1 Hero (world rank 79), was rather serious about formalities.</p>
<p>“There you go again with Nayun-nim…. Just address her casually.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shook her head before quickly turning her head to face me.</p>
<p>“Here, take this.”</p>
<p>She suddenly took out a piece of paper.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“You rested a lot already. It’s time to start working.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha smiled mischievously. This smile of hers always made me anxious. Just what the heck did she do this time?</p>
<p>I swallowed hard and checked the contents of the paper.</p>
<p>[Press Conference Request Form]</p>
<p>“…What? A press conference?”</p>
<p>“Yep. The patent for the baldness cure you created passed. There’s a reason you’re called the ‘Miracle Pharmacist’ right now. Everyone is talking about you, and you’re practically the savior of all men between the ages of 20 and 90.”</p>
<p>“But what’s the press conference for?”</p>
<p>“Well, who knows? Maybe your existence might revive in this world with this press conference.”</p>
<p>A chuckle immediately escaped my mouth. For a mere baldness cure?</p>
<p>However, Yoo Yeonha raised her eyebrows sharply.</p>
<p>“No, I’m being serious. The baldness cure is a huge deal. It’s something that even magic has failed to solve. If you hold a press conference, tens of thousands of people will swarm to it. Do you know how many people in the world are suffering from complete or partial baldness? In the West, over half—”</p>
<p>“Ah, geez, stop. A mere baldness cure won’t—”</p>
<p>“Mere?”</p>
<p>“…Oh right. Didn’t you say you got partial balding from stress?”</p>
<p>“What? No, I didn’t! When did I say that!?”</p>
<p>“Then take this back.”</p>
<p>I gave the document back to Yoo Yeonha. She pouted and put the request form away.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yi Byul asked.</p>
<p>“Anyways, you didn’t come with Cheok Jungyeong?”</p>
<p>It seemed Yi Byul was wistful for some familiar faces.</p>
<p>“Mm, no. They will become wanted targets again.”</p>
<p>“…Wanted targets?”</p>
<p>Yi Byul furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked out the window and stared at the distant sky, then murmured.</p>
<p>“Right about now… they should be in the underground prison, preparing to win Yoo Jinwoong over.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>My eyes widened. I wasn’t the only one. Yi Byul and Rachel also made similar faces.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha waved her hand as though it wasn’t a big deal.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. This matter will be taken care of with utmost secrecy. We finished discussing it with the Association Chairman. Yoo Jinwoong received 15 years behind bars, but Chae Joochul got away scot-free. Maybe feeling bad about that, she agreed as soon as we made the offer.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shrugged before continuing.</p>
<p>“In truth, Jin Seyeon was the one who made the offer first. She’s completely become a member of the Chameleon Troupe now. Something about protecting justice from the shadows…. Well, she’ll become a thief and a destroyer along with the rest of them, but she’ll be doing it to the ‘evil’ ones. Anyways, I’m happy. I don’t want my father rotting away behind bars for 15 years.”</p>
<p><em>Sk, sk.</em> Yoo Yeonha sliced her steak with her knife and fork.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he’ll agree. Traveling the world was his second dream.”</p>
<p>Yi Byul and I stared at Yoo Yeonha. She placed a small chunk of the steak into her mouth.</p>
<p><em>Nom, nom.</em></p>
<p>After gracefully chewing and swallowing the piece, she wiped her mouth with a napkin and put the knife and fork down.</p>
<p>“Now, then.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha interlocked her fingers and rested her chin on them. Then, she made an evil, mischievous smile.</p>
<p>“That’s what’s going on with me. Rachel is probably going to say something about her guild or whatever, so….”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha looked back and forth between me and Yi Byul.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I hear you two’s story?”</p>
<p>The room turned silent for a moment. Rachel and even Droon and Yi Yuri looked curious.</p>
<p>I grabbed Yi Byul’s hand. She seemed to be nervous as it was cold and stiff.</p>
<p>“Well….”</p>
<p>I thought about the people I abandoned. My friends and family, who were my all before I came to this world.</p>
<p>Although I might not be able to see them ever again, I didn’t regret my decision.</p>
<p>I miss them every day and felt saddened when I thought about my parents losing me forever, but I wouldn’t have made this decision if I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“…Our story.”</p>
<p>I thought about Chae Nayun who wasn’t here. I thought about Kim Suho and Shin Jonghak who could not remember me. I thought about the things I could do in this world.</p>
<p>Then, I looked at the person who was very, very precious to me.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to write it from now. Until it becomes a happy ending.”</p>
<p>I spoke as I always did and smiled. Yi Byul smiled back. Everyone in the room smiled.</p>
<p>That was enough.</p>
<p>Although I became a completely different person in a completely different world.</p>
<p>Although I lost everything from the previous world.</p>
<p>The current me… no, we, could confidently say that we are happy.</p>
<p>Since we can forever be with people who are precious to us….</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 377. Epilogue (2), Their Story (Part 1)</p>
<p>“Huu….”</p>
<p>Kim Suho stood in front of the gateway of a temple and took a deep breath. That was how imposing the scene spread out before him was. A surrounding wall prevented outsiders from entering, and the columns of marble visible beyond the gateway seemed to stretch endlessly.</p>
<p>But what made Kim Suho the most nervous was a temple standing tall at the end of the stone road.</p>
<p>Even though it resembled a temple from ancient mythology, it didn’t lack in any way when it came to functionality. This oval structure, which was built with ice glass and shining with a splendid blue light, was known as the ‘Temple of the Nine Heroes.’</p>
<p>It was a structure built by the Hero Association for the nine Heroes - the Nine Stars - who made great contributions during the Great Change and the Devil War.</p>
<p>Today, Kim Suho had been invited to this incredible place. As there was a rule that ‘only members of the Nine Stars and their successors may enter the temple’, it was clear what this invitation signified.</p>
<p>“How does it feel to be a successor?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the person accompanying Kim Suho asked. With a slightly nervous expression, Kim Suho turned to the side. There, Yun Seung-Ah was smiling with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>Her smile made him relax. Kim Suho smiled softly and shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. I feel like there are a lot of things left to do.”</p>
<p>Looking at the Temple of the Nine Heroe, Kim Suho thought about Jin Sahyuk, who returned to Akatrina without a word.</p>
<p>The ill-fated relationship that extended to his previous world had disappeared along with her.</p>
<p>However, that didn’t mean Kim Suho could just forget about her and pretend he didn’t remember her. He couldn’t pretend he forgot about Akatrina either.</p>
<p>As such, his task had yet to disappear.</p>
<p>The path of ‘guardianship’ laid out by his name ‘Suho’ was still awaiting him.</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Not knowing this, Yun Seung-Ah nodded her head with bitterness.</p>
<p>Becoming a member of the Nine Stars meant that he could no longer be a member of any guild. However, she decided to accept this. It seemed it would take Kim Suho at least 10 years until his ascension was finalized, and she also knew that Kim Suho wasn’t a Hero that could be fenced off inside a guild.</p>
<p>“Mm? Suho, over there. There are three more people coming here.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah pointed at the path they just walked through and laughed. Kim Suho turned back and faced the road.</p>
<p>There were three people walking towards them. They all had less-than-average frames.</p>
<p>One was a magician equipped with a cape engraved with nine stars, the other was the Association Chairman who was dressed nicely in a black suit, and the last one was Evandel with her magician’s wand and hat. In any case, all three of them were shorties.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I see them.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho smiled.</p>
<p>At the moment, only Heynckes and Oh Jaejin were confirmed members of the Nine Stars. Four members, including Shin Myungchul, were confirmed dead. However, the three remaining members of the Nine Stars were confirmed to be alive, living in hiding after having lost their powers completely. Once the treatment for the side-effects of Gifts was fully developed, they would be reinstated as members of the Nine Stars.</p>
<p>As such, there were four empty seats for the Nine Stars. And the current Nine Stars had the duty to fill up these seats.</p>
<p>As the Nine Stars were ‘honorary positions with authority’, they would disappear as a legend if all nine Heroes died. But because the Hero Association changed the Nine Stars to an official institution, its empty seats had to be filled.</p>
<p>[The Nine Stars checks the Association, the Association remains conscious of the Nine Stars, and the Temple of Justice supervises the Association.]</p>
<p>The Temple of Justice and Aileen had decentralized the Association’s power to prevent corruption from happening ever again.</p>
<p>“You’re already here.”</p>
<p>The nine-star magician, Ah Hae-In, approached Kim Suho and spoke.</p>
<p>“Hello. I hope you’ve been well.”</p>
<p>“We heard the news. Congratulations.”</p>
<p>Kim Suho and Yun Seung-Ah greeted Ah Hae-In courteously.</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In had already been nominated as a member of the Nine Stars, not as a simple successor. This was due to Oh Jaejin’s recommendation and the fact that she recaptured all of Europe.</p>
<p>The official announcement should be made next week.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sure you two know Aileen. This here is Evandel.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In glanced at Evandel and introduced her. Kim Suho got on his knees and saw eye-to-eye with Evandel who was tightly grabbing Ah Hae-In’s hand.</p>
<p>“Hey, Evandel. We’ve seen each other before. Do you remember me?”</p>
<p>Kim Suho greeted her first. However, Evandel was half-hidden behind Ah Hae-In and remained wary.</p>
<p>In truth, Evandel slightly hated Kim Suho for forgetting Kim Hajin. (Ah Hae-In avoided being hated by Evandel by pretending to remember Kim Hajin.)</p>
<p>Kim Suho asked confusedly, “…Evandel?”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“It’s me, Kim Suho.”</p>
<p>“…I don’t remember you.”</p>
<p>“Hm? We met before, remember?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Hmph.”</p>
<p>Evandel snorted and turned away, but Kim Suho found this to be adorable as well.</p>
<p>This time, Yun Seung-Ah spoke up.</p>
<p>“Haha. Welcome, Evandel.”</p>
<p>“…Who, who are you?”</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>But Yun Seung-Ah was in the same position.</p>
<p>“You, you don’t know me? Aren’t you still friends with Haeyeon? You don’t remember Haeyeon either?”</p>
<p>“I, I know Haeyeon… we’re really close….”</p>
<p>Remaining loyal to Kim Hajin or thinking about sisterly love with Haeyeon. Just as Evandel was hesitating between the two options….</p>
<p>“Wait, Seung-Ah, why are you here?”</p>
<p>Aileen hopped to them and asked. She looked back and forth between Yun Seung-Ah and Kim Suho and moved her eyebrows teasingly.</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘why’. I’m here to accompany him.”</p>
<p>“Oh~? Just that~? I don’t think so~”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah spat back.</p>
<p>“…Well, you can go back now. Only the chosen can enter from here.”</p>
<p>Aileen placed her hand on the temple’s wall. She then said, “It’s me, Aileen. I brought the kids, so let me in.”</p>
<p>Beeeep—</p>
<p>An out-of-place sound rang out, and the gateway opened. Underneath the marble roof and marble pillars, a blue road leading to the temple appeared.</p>
<p>“You two can follow me. The rest can wait outside or go back.”</p>
<p>Ah Hae-In led the Nine Stars candidates in, and Kim Suho and Evandel said goodbye to the other two.</p>
<p>“We’ll be back soon.”</p>
<p>“…We’ll be back soon~”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah and Aileen waved their hands and sent them off.</p>
<p>“Mn, see you later.”</p>
<p>“Good luck on your evaluation~”</p>
<p>Tap, tap…. Less than a few steps in, the gateway closed. Yun Seung-Ah stared at the closed gateway with a tinge of regret, then suddenly asked Aileen.</p>
<p>“Oh right, wasn’t there another candidate?”</p>
<p>“Yep, but she’s out on a campaign.”</p>
<p>“Ah, right, Nayun said she’s going on the Tower of Miracle campaign.”</p>
<p>“Mhm. While a certain someone was too busy chasing after a younger guy, she was putting in a loooot of effort. Thanks to that, she’s doing fantastic.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the third candidate was Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah recalled Chae Nayun who should be fighting within the Tower of Miracle and felt a mixture of bitterness, jealousy, and proudness. After all, it was Creator’s Sacred Grace who initially obtained the right to conquer the Tower of Miracle.</p>
<p>“…Anyways, Unni, I’m surprised you’re still working as the chairman. I thought you’d quit after a few days.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah changed the subject to something else.</p>
<p>Aileen furrowed her brows.</p>
<p>“What? I knew I would do a good job from the beginning.”</p>
<p>“Eii, come on. I thought you’d complain about it nonstop…. Well, I guess it’s good that you’re doing a good job. Good luck at it~”</p>
<p>Eudeuk— Aileen grit her teeth.</p>
<p>But it was clear that the loser would be the first person to get angry.</p>
<p>“…Yeah~ Good luck to you too, Seung-Ah~ Though you’ll be 2nd place for the next 1000 years. Ah, maybe that won’t last long either. I heard the English Royal Court Guild is popping up.”</p>
<p>Aileen sniggered.</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah smiled on the outside and smacked Aileen’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ow. What’d you do that for?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, because it’s funny. That was a good joke. Two thumbs up for you.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Aileen stood silently for a moment before also laughing and strongly pushing Yun Seung-Ah with a Pang—!</p>
<p>“Hehehehe.”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, hahahaha. How funny.”</p>
<p>Yun Seung-Ah didn’t lose her laughter and pressed down on Aileen’s head. In that instant, Aileen’s smile disappeared.</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re going too far. I’m you’re Unni—”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, what do you mean~? It’s funny, isn’t it~?”</p>
<p>Aileen turned serious and tried to push Yun Seung-Ah’s hand off, but Yun Seung-Ah didn’t let her.</p>
<p>“Hey, you! Let go!”</p>
<p>“Hahahahaha.”</p>
<p>“Arggggh! Y-You…!”</p>
<p>After struggling in vain, Aileen finally roused her magic power, and Yun Seung-Ah combatted Aileen with qi reinforcement.</p>
<p>“Unni, why are you suddenly using magic power!?”</p>
<p>“You asked for it!”</p>
<p>“What? You’re the one who provoked me first!”</p>
<p>Childish bickering broke out in front of a solemn temple.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>On the other hand, Yoo Yeonha was engrossed in research. Of course, it was related to Kim Hajin. This “research” took place in her brain only and was really a daydream.</p>
<p>After thinking for a long time, she finally opened her eyes and muttered quietly.</p>
<p>“Baal’s last resort… was the elimination of existence.”</p>
<p>She had repeated these thoughts for several months and arrived at the same conclusion each time.</p>
<p>In the moment of annihilation, Baal had erased Kim Hajin’s existence from this world.</p>
<p>Since Chae Nayun reported that Kim Hajin’s final attack dealt irrecoverable damage to Baal, it made sense that Baal would set Kim Hajin as his target.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha let out a sigh.</p>
<p>Was it because Kim Hajin was close to her? Or was there another reason that she herself didn’t know?</p>
<p>For some reason, Yoo Yeonha couldn’t get Kim Hajin off her mind.</p>
<p>A foolish man who always sacrificed himself until finally losing everything. That was who Kim Hajin was in her eyes. Seeing him laugh even after all this, her heart ached.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Feeling frustrated, Yoo Yeonha stood up and walked out to the balcony. She enjoyed standing there as it showed a full view of Seoul. Looking down at Seoul from this place, she felt a sense of admiration and awe.</p>
<p>Not at the landscape, but at herself for all her accomplishments.</p>
<p>Some people said that obtaining everything left one with a sense of emptiness, but Yoo Yeonha didn't agree. In fact, she treated this as a made-up saying by those who could not accomplish everything they wanted.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had walked a straight road of ambition and arrived at what many would call ‘the summit’. However, she was still full of spirits.</p>
<p>In fact, she was hoping to achieve even greater things in the future. This was because she instinctively knew that challenges and trials far more difficult than those she faced were waiting for her.</p>
<p>“…I'm going to overcome them all.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha muttered in a quiet voice. But who was she talking to? Was it her father? Was it Shin Jonghak, whom she liked for a long time and eventually gave up? Or was it that person…?</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice flowed out from her wrist.</p>
<p>—Vice-Leader, the regular report is here.</p>
<p>Jin Sechan had contacted her with a scheduled report. Yoo Yeonha opened the report while leaning against the balcony guardrail. The first matter was related to Shin Jonghak.</p>
<p>“Jonghak… is still in Africa.”</p>
<p>—Yes, he is planning a redevelopment mission with Orden.</p>
<p>Orden and Shin Jonghak. Yoo Yeonha didn’t know how these two came to work together, but Orden left for Africa after forming a pact with the Association, and Shin Jonghak also traveled to Africa as part of his volunteer work.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Jonghak will be fine on his own. We’ll have to ask him about Orden’s abilities later.”</p>
<p>—The next matter is regarding commerce with Crevon.</p>
<p>“Ah, this one is important.”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha had negotiated with Crevon, using the [Dimensional Entropy] to establish a trading post that would open once every month.</p>
<p>This was a huge event that marked the next era, both for Essence of the Strait and Earth.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha discussed the matter with Jin Sechan until Seoul’s scenery became dyed by night.</p>
<p>“…We will discuss the rest during the next formal meeting.”</p>
<p>—Yes, understood.</p>
<p>Even so, they couldn’t come to a conclusion. Yoo Yeonha hung up the call and was surprised to see that the sun had fully set.</p>
<p>“Time… flies.”</p>
<p>She suddenly got emotional.</p>
<p>The more time flowed, the less time she would have to think about people. Of course, there were still people she never forgot about.</p>
<p>“Oh, right.”</p>
<p>Suddenly remembering something, Yoo Yeonha looked at her smartwatch. Then, she recalled the long message saved in it.</p>
<p>It was the message she had written to Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>It was shocking enough to awaken her memories every time. She was still dumbfounded as to how she ever got herself to write such a message.</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha shook her head and went back to staring at Seoul’s scenery.</p>
<p>After viewing the city and Han River for a while, she suddenly realized that there was no one in Seoul that she wanted.</p>
<p>“Hm… Sechan-ssi?”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha turned on her smartwatch once again and messaged Jin Sechan.</p>
<p>“Empty my schedule next week, same time.”</p>
<p>—Got it. It is for that place, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She didn’t know why, but seeing the people there melted her fatigue away and recharged her energy. And it wasn’t just him, the other people there helped motivate her to spend more time working.</p>
<p>In a way, they were like a fatigue recovery potion.</p>
<p>“…Huaa~”</p>
<p>Yoo Yeonha let out a pleased breath and sank her body in a rocking chair on the balcony.</p>
<p>Whish—</p>
<p>A refreshing breeze blew, brushing past the smile that surfaced on her face.</p>
<p>Within this cool night breeze, Yoo Yeonha fell into a light sleep.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Africa’s sun rose to the middle of the sky. Facing the beams of light that were stronger than in other places, Shin Jonghak and the other members of the ‘Pioneering Crew’ clothed themselves with magic-imbued items. It was thanks to these air conditioned turbans and capes that they could work comfortably.</p>
<p>But even the best equipment had limits.</p>
<p>A desert monster’s hyperthermic attack caused the redevelopment plans to temporarily pause, and the members of the Pioneering Crew had returned to their oasis base camp before the sun reached the middle of the sky.</p>
<p>“…Are you tired?”</p>
<p>Orden approached Shin Jonghak, the leader of the Pioneering Crew, who was currently soaking his head inside the oasis. Shin Jonghak raised his head slightly and answered.</p>
<p>“It’s hot.”</p>
<p>“For humans, yes.”</p>
<p>Orden had left Russia and found a place for himself here. He had already formed a secret pact with the Association, which showed great interest and wariness towards Orden.</p>
<p>And Shin Jonghak, as the leader of the Pioneering Crew, founded a city in Africa. After driving away all the monsters living in this oasis, he had recovered the ‘monster city’ Orden founded in the past. Though, it was hard to call it a ‘city’ since it had been destroyed by African monsters.</p>
<p>“Things will get better soon. Once we recover the capital, though it will still be hot, this absurd heat should disappear.”</p>
<p>“…You already think this land belongs to you?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak asked as he glanced at Orden. Then, Orden shrugged like a real human being.</p>
<p>“I can’t help it. There are many beastmen in this place, and without me, Africa will be uninhabitable for the human race.”</p>
<p>Beastmen.</p>
<p>The Association had replaced the word ‘humanoid monster’ with beastmen. Interestingly, the beastmen who’d survived were those who were fused with animals like cats, pigs, dogs, cows, and others.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak buried his face in the water one last time before standing tall.</p>
<p>“…You think humans can live in Africa?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I plan on creating a country where humans and beastmen can live in harmony.”</p>
<p>“…That’s a nice dream. Unfortunately, we live in a democratic world. Monarchy won’t be accepted in this day and age.”</p>
<p>“Recently, the people of English have been wanting to give the authority of the Prime Minister to the English Royal Family.”</p>
<p>Orden had great interests in world news. Shin Jonghak scratched his head, not knowing whether that was true or not.</p>
<p>Orden continued to talk.</p>
<p>“If there is someone who is capable of protecting his citizens and making them happy, a monarchy will not pose any problem. And I want to make everyone happy. Not just beastmen. I will stop any monsters who attempt to advance to Western Europe and the Middle East every year. This is a part of the agreement I had with the Association.”</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>As Shin Jonghak didn’t have a clue about current affairs and politics, he didn’t say a thing. Orden also didn’t say anything else.</p>
<p>But, he asked something he had been curious about.</p>
<p>“I have one question. Where did that woman go?”</p>
<p>“Woman…? Ah, you mean Jin Sahyuk?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that was her name.”</p>
<p>The only woman related to Orden was Jin Sahyuk.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak smirked.</p>
<p>“Kim Suho said she returned to her home country.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask? Do you have a crush on her?”</p>
<p>“…I do not understand such a feeling yet.”</p>
<p>Orden smiled faintly and shook his head.</p>
<p>“I am simply curious about what someone who believes herself to be a king is doing.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak was also curious. From what Kim Suho told him— Jin Sahyuk was surprisingly someone from another world who had reincarnated on Earth, and she had apparently returned to her homeworld, though no one knew whether it was because she wanted to be a king or because she grew tired of Earth.</p>
<p>“I’m sure she’s doing fine being a king. She’s stro—”</p>
<p>Whoosh—</p>
<p>A beam of light shot up in the distant sky and cut off Shin Jonghak. Shin Jonghak turned his gaze to the Atlantic sky. Strange beams of light were undulating like an aurora.</p>
<p>“Looks like they succeeded.”</p>
<p>Orden voiced Shin Jonghak’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak, who was standing in a daze, muttered out a phrase.</p>
<p>“…The Tower of Miracle.”</p>
<p>He dusted off his cape and got up.</p>
<p>Orden asked.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Hyenas will flock to that place soon.”</p>
<p>A successful Tower campaign was always followed by an assault by Djinns. It was almost guaranteed at this point. The best-case scenario for the Djinns was stealing the reward, but even if they couldn’t, it was a great opportunity to kill the exhausted Heroes.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be any different this time.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to protect them just in case.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak picked up his spear and stood up. A teleportation portal was set up nearby. He should be able to get there in two hours.</p>
<p>“W-Wait! Let me go too—!”</p>
<p>At that moment, a high-pitched voice rang out. Shin Jonghak turned around unwittingly. The Pioneering Crew’s sole supporter, Yi Jiyoon, was running over.</p>
<p>“Let, let me go too—! Take me with you!”</p>
<p>“…You?”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak’s eyes narrowed. Yi Jiyoon smiled brightly and nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Yes! A supporter has gotta follow where her boss is going! It’s been a while since I’ve been in Seoul too…. I want to go with you… Boss.”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon’s face reddened as she muttered the last word. Shin Jonghak stared at her fixedly.</p>
<p>“I-If I can’t, that’s fine too….”</p>
<p>Yi Jiyoon couldn’t meet his gaze and dropped her head. As Shin Jonghak wasn’t an idiot, he knew what emotion was behind the words Yi Jiyoon spoke.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“…Do what you want.”</p>
<p>“Ah, really?! Thank you!”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak turned back coldly, and Yi Jiyoon chased after him as if he was the coolest person in the world.</p>
<p>“…Hm.”</p>
<p>Orden stared at Shin Jonghak and Yi Jiyoon with a look of interest. Then, he muttered with a smirk.</p>
<p>“What a complex emotion.”</p>
<p>He slowly followed Shin Jonghak and Yi Jiyoon. The Pioneering Crew had some free time, so going there didn’t seem to pose a problem.</p>
<p>“I will go too.”</p>
<p>A conquered Tower and interesting human emotions. Orden’s curiosity had grown too big to miss out.</p>
<p>“…Do what you want.”</p>
<p>Shin Jonghak answered. Hearing his apathetic tone, Orden smiled.</p>
<p>—Krrrr.</p>
<p>Kurukuru approached Orden as he slowly walked forward.</p>
<p>As a loyal servant who was ready to follow any order, he had shown up once Orden showed signs of leaving.</p>
<p>—Krrrr.</p>
<p>“Yes, Kurukuru.”</p>
<p>Orden, who once called himself the Monster King, realized already.</p>
<p>That ‘origin’ was meaningless when it came to life. Just like how the journey was more important than the destination, the direction was more important than the origin.</p>
<p>“Follow me. We’re going on a small journey.”</p>
<p>As such, Orden decided to focus on the question of ‘what life he should lead’ rather than ‘how his life came to be’.</p>
<p>This was a trivial yet huge change in Orden’s heart.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 378. Epilogue (2), Their Story [Part 2] [COMPLETE]</p>
<p><em>Psss-</em> Pieces of rocks crumbled down on Chae Nayun’s head. Like waterdrops gently falling on the ground, they only tickled her cheeks. Naturally, she was shaken awake.</p>
<p>“…Uuuuu.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun twisted her body side to side before opening her mouth with a groan.</p>
<p>“Uk… uueek!”</p>
<p>She felt sore all over. Her limbs and even her internal organs ached. Thankfully, none of her injuries were lethal or incapable of treatment.</p>
<p>“Augh. Kuhuk.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun coughed as she held onto her side where a pang of pain flared up. Along with crumbs of rocks, blood shot out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“Fuu….”</p>
<p>She relaxed her exhausted body and looked around at the outcome of the event that just unfolded.</p>
<p>The expedition team had conquered most of the Tower. In other words, they were on the brink of conquering the Tower of Miracle. There should have been one final stage left.</p>
<p>However, while the team was in the middle of passing through the final hurdle, the floor had suddenly collapsed. Chae Nayun managed to push the others away to save them from the trap, but….</p>
<p>“Ssp.”</p>
<p>She herself had failed to avoid it.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun wiped off the blood around her mouth and fixed her posture. Then, she checked her smartwatch. She had received countless messages from her comrades.</p>
<p>[Are you okay, Miss?]</p>
<p>[We won the final battle, so please wait. We will come rescue you right away….]</p>
<p>Chae Nayun was about to respond but quit and put down her smartwatch.</p>
<p>“…Haa.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, she felt tired.</p>
<p>The Tower, rewards, life, everything.</p>
<p>In a way, she had lost her motivation.</p>
<p>She was eager and full of passion when she first entered the Tower of Miracle, and she thought she could forget about complicated matters like Kim Hajin, Chae Joochul, and Chae Jinyoon.</p>
<p>But now that things had come to this, she didn’t feel anything.</p>
<p>Although the team was just moments away from conquering the tower, she wasn’t happy and felt empty. She almost felt it would be better to just die like this.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun slouched her shoulders. Her body was cold. She rummaged through her pockets, but there was nothing to chew or smoke, and her body began to heal her injuries on its own.</p>
<p>With her body, she couldn’t even die easily.</p>
<p>“Tsk. …?”</p>
<p>Just as she clicked her tongue, she suddenly caught sight of something in the rubble.</p>
<p>It was a faint sparkle at first.</p>
<p>Something was sparkling within the mountain of rocks spread across the ground. It was enough to provoke a mild ‘curiosity’.</p>
<p>“What’s that…?”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun staggered up. Then, she slowly approached the light.</p>
<p>The silvery cluster of light became clearer as Chae Nayun drew near it. It was almost as if it was calling Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>Soon, she arrived at the source of light. She narrowed her eyes and looked inside the rubble.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>The thing that was shining was a small rock. It was buried within some grey rocks.</p>
<p>Without much thought, Chae Nayun reached out and picked it up.</p>
<p>Then, strange characters popped up in front of her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Miracle Stone] [Pinnacle-grade Miracle]</p>
<p>▷One of the last rewards of the ‘Tower of Miracle’</p>
<p>—When used, the user will experience ‘Regression’, a pinnacle-grade miracle.</p>
<p>—The world before regressing and the world after regressing are separate worlds and will not affect each other in any way.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun took a step back in shock. Her trembling hands let go of the stone, which then dropped to the floor.</p>
<p><em>Koong—</em></p>
<p>The stone made a strange reverberation, but the window in front of Chae Nayun did not disappear.</p>
<p>—When used, the user will experience ‘Regression’, a pinnacle-grade miracle.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun blankly stared at this sentence.</p>
<p>Then, she rubbed her eyes repeatedly. She thought it was only a matter of time before something so absurd disappeared.</p>
<p>—When used, the user will experience ‘Regression’, a pinnacle-grade miracle.</p>
<p>However, the message remained in the air. In fact, it let out an even brighter light and enticed Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>…<em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p>Chae Nayun swallowed hard. However, she soon shook her head.</p>
<p>Even if this situation wasn’t a dream and was really a reward from the ‘Tower of Miracle’, the tale of Shin Myungchul and the Regression Stone was a well-known bedtime story by now.</p>
<p>As there was a side-effect to a miracle on the level of going back in time, it wasn’t something that could be done so easily.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>Her body didn’t follow her brain.</p>
<p>‘It would be problematic if this stone fell in someone else’s hands….’ Justifying herself, Chae Nayun held the [Miracle Stone]. The mystical power contained within the stone circulated on her palm and created a small gust of wind.</p>
<p>—When used, the user will experience ‘Regression’, a pinnacle-grade miracle.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun tightened her grip on the stone.</p>
<p>Doing so, she was naturally reminded of ‘a certain someone’. Perhaps the Miracle Stone was leading her thoughts in that direction.</p>
<p>In any case, she remembered her ‘relationship with Kim Hajin’, which was twisted from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun hated Kim Hajin, yet loved him at the same time. Both her love and hatred were eternally irreversible.</p>
<p>However, a miracle that could overturn this ‘irreversible’ problem had just appeared.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared at the Miracle Stone with a dazed look.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>She pondered.</p>
<p>If she had a better ending, would she have the right to choose it?</p>
<p>If she did, would that really be the better ending? Or was she simply running away from reality?</p>
<p>“…Pft.”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun didn’t ponder for long. The answer was clear, so she only shook her head.</p>
<p>“After all you’ve been through?”</p>
<p>It was true that this item was hard to pass by. But it would also bring disaster elsewhere without a doubt.</p>
<p>And so, just as Chae Nayun was about to put the [Miracle Stone] away….</p>
<p>—As Baal has been annihilated, Baal will not exist in the world after the regression.</p>
<p>Chae Nayun froze.</p>
<p>She looked at the message that had been newly created. The bright light illuminating the message flowed into her eyes. This cluster of light became a message that whispered into her ears.</p>
<p>The message settled all of her worries.</p>
<p>The problem between Chae Nayun and Kim Hajin wasn’t Kim Hajin killing Chae Jinyoon. It wasn’t their meeting either.</p>
<p>It was all because of a devil known as ‘Baal’.</p>
<p>Without Baal, Chae Jinyoon wouldn’t have needed to die, and Chae Nayun and Kim Hajin would have had no reason to fight….</p>
<p><em>Wiiing—</em></p>
<p>It was then that the smartwatch she dropped vibrated.</p>
<p>“…Eu!”</p>
<p>Startled, Chae Nayun looked back and forth between the [Miracle Stone] and the smartwatch.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, she could feel the presence of her teammates close by.</p>
<p>With a <em>Koong—</em>, the sound of the Tower’s shell collapsing rang out. A Tower transforming into magic power and rising to the sky. This marked a successful Tower campaign.</p>
<p>Thus, Chae Nayun wasn’t left with much time to make her decision.</p>
<p>She looked at the Miracle Stone in her hands.</p>
<p>—Have a happy life.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kim Hajin’s voice lingered in her ears.</p>
<p>Was it yesterday, or the day before? He had said these words with sincerity.</p>
<p>“….”</p>
<p>Chae Nayun stared at Kim Hajin, whose face was reflected on the surface of the [Miracle Stone]. She thought about the happiness this stone could bring her.</p>
<p>A bright voice and a bright face popped up inside her heart.</p>
<p>The Miracle Stone.</p>
<p>And Regression.</p>
<p>This was perhaps the only chance she had to reach a happy ending. But in another way, this could be seen as a way of escaping.</p>
<p>This item bringing about a dangerous temptation…</p>
<p>She looked at it for a long time.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>The moment Chae Nayun discovered the ‘Miracle Stone’, Bell opened his eyes.</p>
<p>He could sense that the miracle assigned by Baal had been discovered.</p>
<p>“Looks like the Regression Stone has been found.”</p>
<p>Bell spoke to the existence fused within him. However, no answer returned no matter how long he waited.</p>
<p>Only after a long time did something undulate inside him and eke out a voice.</p>
<p>—I know.</p>
<p>It was Baal’s voice.</p>
<p>Bell smiled faintly.</p>
<p>Currently, Baal had been reduced to the soul of an ordinary human being. This was because his true self has been annihilated, with Bell having absorbed ‘a piece of Baal’s consciousness’.</p>
<p>In the first place, Baal was a soul that could not be extinguished easily. It was a bomb that could easily destroy a world if it exploded. As such, Bell voluntarily took on the role of keeping Baal’s soul, and to Baal, this was the greatest punishment.</p>
<p>“Do you think that child will go back in time?”</p>
<p>A smile spread across Bell’s face. He had asked out of pure curiosity. Baal was interested in the human known as Chae Nayun.</p>
<p>However, Baal returned a simple reply.</p>
<p>—That would depend on her feelings towards ‘that guy’.</p>
<p>It sounded as though he knew everything that was about to occur, yet he seemed to be looking forward to the future.</p>
<p>Bell smiled and asked.</p>
<p>“Mm… then wanna make a bet? I’ll bet 5 years that she won’t use it.”</p>
<p>—Then I will bet that she does.</p>
<p>This was a bet using their lifespan as chips. Although Baal had lost his body and his authorities, it was easy for him to make one person live for eternity.</p>
<p>As such, Baal wanted to curse Bell, who dared to use him, with the curse of ‘immortality’.</p>
<p>Of course, Bell did not want this, and after much debate, they began a bet using the base 100 years of a human's life as chips.</p>
<p>“Eii, there’s no way she’ll do it. Think about it. Shin Myungchul went back in time, making you come to Earth. Chae Nayun is a good kid. She won’t do it because of how eerie it is.”</p>
<p>—….</p>
<p>Hearing this, Baal fell silent.</p>
<p>Then soon, Bell felt a portion of the demonic energy in his chest disappear.</p>
<p>Bell’s face stiffened.</p>
<p>“Wait, that’s cheating. What did you do?”</p>
<p>—Nothing.</p>
<p>“Nothing, my ass…. Aha, you sent a message, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>A message crossing dimensions.</p>
<p>As Baal was the one who created the Regression Stone, it was no surprise that he could send a message to whoever possessed it.</p>
<p>“You did, didn’t you?!”</p>
<p>When Bell shouted, Baal smiled calmly. Baal had employed a dubious method, but Bell had seen him smile for the first time in a long while. Because of this, Bell couldn’t get angry and only furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>“Geez….”</p>
<p>—The bet still stands.</p>
<p>“Sure. I still bet on the same thing. 5 years that she won’t use it.”</p>
<p>—I’ll bet 10 years that she does.</p>
<p>“Did you forget? 5 years is the maximum.”</p>
<p>Bell smirked and leaned against the carriage wall.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Your Highness, please prepare for the coronation.”</p>
<p>His servant’s voice rang out from outside the carriage.</p>
<p>Bell replied “Yes” rather imposingly before looking at the mirror placed in the corner of the carriage.</p>
<p>The one reflected inside the mirror wasn’t Baal, but Bell.</p>
<p>Bell looked at the mirror and asked Baal.</p>
<p>“What is your plan from now?”</p>
<p>—…If possible, I want to kill the bastard who became the new god, but at my current state, that is a faraway dream.</p>
<p>“Can’t you tell your friends? Leraje and Vassago are still fighting on Earth.”</p>
<p>—Those two have already been corrupted by Earth. They will enjoy living as mortals to their hearts’ content before returning to the Transcendent Realm.</p>
<p>“Strange devils, aren’t they?”</p>
<p>—Strange? Most devils were angels at birth. Most of them interact with humans if they want to and play with humans if they want to.</p>
<p>Baal grumbled unhappily.</p>
<p>“Then why are you like this?”</p>
<p>—I was created to be defiant. Shouldn’t you know this too?</p>
<p>Baal was created from Kim Hajin’s setting. He was saying Kim Hajin had made him like this. In a way, it was a bit of a cruel fate.</p>
<p>“…Touché.”</p>
<p>Bell shrugged.</p>
<p>“King Terhun’s coronation will now begin—!”</p>
<p>Just as he was feeling a bit awkward, a loud shout rang out.</p>
<p><em>Sssk—</em></p>
<p>The carriage door opened from both sides. Beyond a brilliant red curtain, a ‘royal road’ made of highest-quality carpet spread out before him.</p>
<p>It was the pathway to his throne.</p>
<p>Hundreds of his servants were standing in a line to the side of the red road, and tens of thousands of citizens were looking up at him from underneath.</p>
<p>Bell slowly raised his head and looked up at the throne, which was placed close to the sun in a spot that could look down at all others.</p>
<p>“Arunheim’s glorious ruler, King Terhun—!”</p>
<p>A fierce shout resounded.</p>
<p>Bell stepped out of the carriage. With long-reaching steps, he walked up the stairs of the royal road step by step.</p>
<p>“O King—!”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty Terhun—!”</p>
<p>“Lord Savior who has overcome calamity and returned—!”</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people celebrated the coronation with loud screams piercing the sky.</p>
<p>As king, Bell kept their voices in mind.</p>
<p>So that he wouldn’t betray them, and so that he wouldn’t make the same mistake again.</p>
<p>—Terhun… Is that a new name? It’s much better than Bell.</p>
<p>Baal muttered from inside his heart.</p>
<p>Bell fixed his gaze on the throne and murmured calmly.</p>
<p>“Look forward to it. A ‘mortal’ life is far more beautiful and fulfilling than you think.”</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>…Everything was destroyed in this world.</p>
<p>Standing on the black barren land, Jin Sahyuk looked around her surroundings.</p>
<p>There was no sign of life anywhere around her. Grass had become ash and scattered away, and the earth was barely breathing after being devoured by demonic energy. The trees were dyed in a reddish-brown hue, and the sky was stained purple.</p>
<p>“Tsk….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk stared at this desolate landscape without a word.</p>
<p>Three months had already passed since she arrived in this place.</p>
<p>The home she knew was nowhere to be seen. Not even a tiny piece remained intact.</p>
<p>She recalled Earth as she stood in her broken home world.</p>
<p>Lying on the grass and looking up at the blue sky… hovering amidst the clouds, looking down at the ground…. Although she denied it at the time, thinking about it now, the landscape she enjoyed flashed before her eyes.</p>
<p>Kim Hajin. Or Kindspring.</p>
<p>The man who carried all of the mysteries of this world….</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk closed her eyes and sighed.</p>
<p>Should I have seen him before I left?</p>
<p>Should I have asked him for advice?</p>
<p>“…Hu.”</p>
<p>Soon, Jin Sahyuk shook her head.</p>
<p>She was determined to live a lonely life.</p>
<p>A king must not show weakness and must live and die with her country.</p>
<p>If this world died, then she would happily die with this world.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot worse than I thought.”</p>
<p>Shimurin’s voice rang out. Jin Sahyuk raised her head slightly and looked at her. With a flick of her hand, Shimurin drove the demonic energy in the land away.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk spoke.</p>
<p>“You can go back if it is too hard. You’ve already been here for 3 months.”</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>Shimurin glanced at Jin Sahyuk as if she hadn’t expected to hear this. Then, she grinned and shook her head.</p>
<p>“It’s fine. The more difficult a problem is, the more stubborn I get.”</p>
<p>“…Don’t regret it later.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk clutched her cape. It was the [Cape of Alexander the Great] she got from Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“So, what’s your plan? Aren’t we in Plerion’s territory like you wanted?”</p>
<p>Shimurin asked.</p>
<p>“It’s simple.”</p>
<p>Akatrina had fully undergone Demon Realm Transformation, so it was obvious what Jin Sahyuk had to do.</p>
<p>Find people.</p>
<p>From what she saw on Earth, Demon Realm Transformation was only limited to the surface. If people survived, they should be living deep underground.</p>
<p>“I will find my citizens and go underground.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk carried everything she brought from Earth and moved her legs.</p>
<p>But despite her confident declaration, her steps had no destination nor goal.</p>
<p>The intuition she always believed in was quiet today.</p>
<p>Could it be that even her intuition did not trust her?</p>
<p>Or was there no one left alive in this world?</p>
<p>“Haa… haa….”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk walked until her lungs were scalded by demonic energy. She didn’t use qi reinforcement or try to purify the demonic energy. As Shimurin’s magic was limited, Jin Sahyuk fell to her knees after six hours of walking.</p>
<p><em>Rustle— Rustle—</em></p>
<p>Then suddenly, something inside her cape rubbed against the cape. Jin Sahyuk purified the demonic energy within her through qi circulation as she put her hand inside her pocket.</p>
<p>However, she couldn’t grab onto anything.</p>
<p>Thinking that it might be the back pocket, she rummaged through that one too. But as expected, there was nothing there.</p>
<p>“…Hm?”</p>
<p>No, there <em>was</em> something.</p>
<p>It was a folded piece of paper.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk placed the paper on her palm.</p>
<p>‘What is this? Why is it here?’ Although she didn’t know at first, she remembered as soon as she saw the paper.</p>
<p>This was the [Infinite Communication Letter] she had used to communicate with Kim Hajin back when the two of them worked together.</p>
<p>With this, she was able to communicate with Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk smiled as she looked down at the letter. An unknown emotion welled up, but she soon fixed her resolve.</p>
<p>[Can you see this?]</p>
<p>She wrote four words with her magic power.</p>
<p>“Ah, why am I doing something so useless….”</p>
<p>She regretted it immediately afterwards, but she wasn’t given the time to blame herself.</p>
<p>——!</p>
<p>A screech rang out. The world shook once again. Jin Sahyuk and Shimurin turned to the direction of the sound.</p>
<p>A dinosaur-like monster was standing there.</p>
<p>Its huge legs boasted terrifying muscles, and its body was the size of a castle. It was bigger than any monster she had seen on Earth.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk put her bags down and roused her magic power.</p>
<p>“What a tough world.”</p>
<p>Shimurin muttered from next to her.</p>
<p>“But that’s what makes it more exciting.”</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk answered as she stretched her body. The monster had already spotted them and was preparing to charge.</p>
<p>“Then let’s go.”</p>
<p>The moment Jin Sahyuk created hundreds of weapons with her magic power, tiny words began to appear on the Communication Letter.</p>
<p>Words continued writing themselves for a long time, but Jin Sahyuk didn’t have the time to look at it. This was because the monster was rushing towards them.</p>
<p>[I see it. Jin Sahyuk, right? What are you up to right….]</p>
<p>However, Jin Sahyuk could hear the soft sounds of words being scribbled on the paper. It was clear proof that the connection to Earth remained.</p>
<p>——!</p>
<p>The monster charged in while swinging its head.</p>
<p>However, Jin Sahyuk wasn’t afraid. All her worries and troubles had been resolved. As such, she could smile even in the face of this destructive monster running towards her while splitting the earth.</p>
<p>Jin Sahyuk felt like she could find her people here. That she could find traces of fire or footsteps left behind by them. And with them, she felt like she could rebuild Plerion.</p>
<p>This hope had all been re-kindled by the letter connected to Kim Hajin.</p>
<p>——!</p>
<p>The monster’s body and Jin Sahyuk’s magic power clashed.</p>
<p>Using ‘Reality Manipulation’, she temporarily expelled the surrounding demonic energy and turned the sky blue. And under the sky that had returned to its past color, Jin Sahyuk shouted while standing arrogantly.</p>
<p>“I’VE RETURNED—!”</p>
<p>Her voice was clearer and brighter than ever before.</p>
<p>...</p>
