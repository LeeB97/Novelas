<p>China city suburbs, noon.</p>
<p>This is a normal street in what could not be a more regular civilian area, the burning sun baking the ground along with the countless pedestrians,, causing the passing-by pedestrians to occasionally complain about or curse at the uncomfortable weather. The area couldn’t be considered calm, but it wouldn’t be as lively and flourishing as the center of the city.</p>
<p>At the side of the street, a still body lay on the ground. The intense sun like fire, yet he wore a body of black body wrap, under the intense sun you didn’t need to think to know that the pure black face cloth was incredibly hot. Not to mention the ground was already baked to the point that people don’t even dare to touch it. Black clothes such as his, the ground the way it is, just the thought of how they feel sticking to the skin can induce fear. Yet this person, has already been lying there for one day and one night.</p>
<p>“Why is this person still here?”</p>
<p>“Probably dead already.”</p>
<p>The gaze of pedestrians only stopped on him for a brief moment before quickly leaving. The majority of people living here belonged to the lower cast of society, rushing about busily every day for their livelihood. In this society where human nature is cold, kindness for them is a cheap thing. At the same time, in this era, a person how has collapsed on the street must not be helped, this unwittingly had already become a cold consensus.</p>
<p>“Quick mom, look, there’s a person? Is he sick?” A little boy with his hand held by his mom points his finger at the man on the ground and says.</p>
<p>“Don’t get close to him, do not forget what mama said before, people who have collapsed on the ground, a lot of them is because they have contracted ‘Isrock’ and thus been abandoned, you must never get close or else you will get infected. Come, let’s get a bit further away.”</p>
<p>“Ahh!” the little boy gave a cry, his face revealing a scared look, taking his mother’s hand on his own and running towards a further area, even afraid to just give the man another look.</p>
<p>Even a boy that is just six, seven years old knows the dreadfulness of “Isrock”.</p>
<p>“Isrock”, is a terminal illness that can cause the human body’s immune system and life force to slowly deteriorate. The only way way to contract the disease is from another “Isrock” carrier. Its nature is similar to “AIDS” that was once common in the 20th and 21st centuries, but is a lot more scarier than “AIDS”. At the moment, after contracting Isrock the world’s longest survivor only lived for five years.</p>
<p>After entering the 30th century, humans suffered from Mother Nature’s revenge. To fight for the increasingly limited resources, terrible battles constantly erupted, the smokes of war rose from all corners of the world. By the nuclear and magnetic pollution left behind after the battles, the “Isrock” disease was born. After people with naturally weak immune systems live in these polluted environments for a long time, it is easy for their bodies to develop the “Isrock” virus. The appearance of the “Isrock” virus also meant that this life was nearing its end.</p>
<p>Even more terrifying is the contagiousness of the “Isrock: virus. It can spread through any bodily fluid…including blood, saliva, even sweat…therefore, whenever a person contracts the “Isrock” virus, their family can only choose to mercilessly abandon them. Because no amount of money or effort is enough to save their life, keeping them on the other hand could cause even more people to become infected…</p>
<p>“Isrock” is like a horrifying demon causing people to avoid it only afraid that they are too slow. While it, has been considered Heaven’s punishment towards humanity’s cruel battles. Because without the nuclear and magnetic pollution left behind by the battles, the “Isrock” virus would not have been born. Thus, under the criticism and cries of the world’s citizens, the “Hundred Year Armistice Convention” known by the whole world was signed by each country. And the battleground to solve international disputes, under the terms of the “Convention”, moved towards the second world that humans had already become deeply dependent upon, the virtual reality game world.</p>
<p>Using the win or loss of battles in the game world to settle issues, this method was approved and accepted by the majority of people in the world. After the “Hundred Year Armistice Convention” was signed, the advances in virtual world games had also reached an unprecedented pinnacle. Each country would also pour in large amounts of financial resources and painstaking effort on the topic of training the gaming world’s top players.</p>
<p>After the “Hundred Year Armistice Convention”, following the decrease in nuclear and magnetic pollution, carriers of “Isrock” became less, but the horrifying shadow it left humanity would never dissipate.</p>
<p>And so, this black clothed man lying on the side of the road, who people naturally assumed was one of the poor abandoned people who had the “Isrock” virus, not a single person dared to get close.</p>
<p>Until…</p>
<p>“Big brother! Big Brother, hurry and wake up, you’ll get a horrible burn lying on the ground like that. Big brother…””</p>
<p>In front of the man, there was little girl wearing a light yellow dress, she only looked about ten, with a pair of eyes as beautiful as the stars and a young face as intricate as a clay doll. Any who saw her would subconsciously stop, wondering in amazement if they were looking at an angel who accidentally appeared on earth.</p>
<p>The little girl held a cold drink of which small portion had been drank in one hand, her other hand throwing away her parasol, lightly shaking the non-moving male, her star like eyes filled with worry and anxiety, calling out with a soft, tender voice.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because the man was only lightly knocked out, or maybe he was never unconscious to begin with, under the call of the girls not too loud voice, the man’s body slightly moved a bit, and slowly, incredibly difficultly lifted his head up, revealing a pale man’s face, this is a teenager who looks no older than 16,17 years of age, messy hair, lips completely cracked, more so his entire face was scary pale. He opened his eyes slightly, clouded eyes meeting a pair of pure, crystal like eyes.</p>
<p>Such pretty…eyes…</p>
<p>“Thank goodness thank goodness, you’re finally awake!” the girl gave a sigh of relief, and then happily laughed. The teenage male looked at her pure, flawless smile through his hazy eyesight, startled for a moment. Before today, he had experienced too much cold stares and indifference, and had long ago become accustomed to it, he found it a little hard to believe that on this world there still existed such a pair of pure, clean eyes.</p>
<p>“Big brother, are you sick?” Can you stand up? It’s very hot lying on the ground like that…ah, no problem, my dad and mom are about to be here. They’ll help big brother, oh right, my dad is a doctor here, he’ll definitely make big brother better again.” The little girl held up her parasol, covering her upper body, using a soft, pleasant voice asking and comforting him.</p>
<p>The man moved his chapped lips, his throat as if burned by fire. He tried for a long time, but only managed to say one word…</p>
<p>“…Water…”</p>
<p>“Water…” The girl blinked her eyes and then placed the slightly drunken cold drink at his lips: “I don’t have water… will this do? It’s very cooling, and very sweet.”</p>
<p>The little girl carefully placed the straw in his mouth, the teen used all his energy, taking a long drink, instantly, a mass of cold liquid like a clear spring filled his mouth. After it slowly flowed down his throat, flowing into what seemed as a dead body. At that moment, he finally felt the existence of his own body, his vision also became clearer. He tightly bit the straw that brought him back from the line of death. His eyes, staring at the girl who was at the same time looking at him, not willing to leave.</p>
<p>“Is it tasty? If it tastes good then drink the rest of it hehe, if you want to drink more, I can have papa and mama buy it again later.” Seeing him trying hard to suck the straw, the girl’s thin brows arched into two crescent moons, revealing a super kawaii to the max smile. This smile was also heavily imprinted in his heart… he knew, this life, it would be impossible to forget this moment, and especially this girl.</p>
<p>Uniform footsteps came from behind, the girl turned around immediately, proceeding to wave her hands and started shouting: “Papa, Mama, I’m here, there’s a big brother here who’s collapsed.”</p>
<p>The one who came are a husband and wife not yet in their middle ages, regular clothes highlighting that their family was not wealthy. When they saw the girl and the man lying on the ground beside her, both of them had the living daylights scarred out of them.</p>
<p>“Ruo Ruo (若若）, hurry up and get away from him!” The girl’s mother ran towards her terrified, hastily carrying the girl to the side. With a soft cry, the cold drink in the girl’s hand slipped, cooling liquid splashing across the ground.</p>
<p>“Nn…Mama, why did you carry me aside, big brother is thirsty, he really wants to drink water…mama, papa, can you guys save him please? Papa, you’re a great doctor, you’ll definitely save him right? “The girl struggled slightly in her mother’s embrace, her eyes revealing her worry as she looked at the teenage boy,</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, he does not have ‘Isrock’.”</p>
<p>The girl’s father is a doctor, usually he interacts with a lot of “Isrock” patients, after looking at the teen a couple times, and he knew that he did not contract Isrock. Only after listening to his words did the mother feel relieved. She crouched down, showing an apologetic smile towards the teen: “Child, sorry, at the time I was too worried about Ruo Ruo (若若) which is why… what’s your name? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>The teen’s lips moved, after a while, he difficultly let out a voice: “My…name…”</p>
<p>What is my name right now… I don’t know.</p>
<p>Because. I already decided to forget my past name… I really wish I can forget forever.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>July 5th, 3100, China’s capital city, noon, the fierce sun like fire.</p>
<p>Yun Feng (云风) shook his head that was already covered in sweat droplets, glancing at the intense sun above his head and complaining. Up until know, he’d been standing under this ruthless sun for one whole hour. Looking forward at the nearing counter, he comforted himself and let out a sigh, grumbling in a low voice: “Alas, if it wasn’t for my stubborn little sister, I wouldn’t come for this torture for generations. Men with little sisters really can’t afford to be injured.”</p>
<p>Today is already the 30th day that the gaming equipment for “Shen Yue”(Mystic Moon) was released, naturally the extent of the crowd of people receiving the gaming equipment cannot compare to the first half of the month. Even so, when Yun Feng got there, the massive queue still scared him enough that he nearly turned around and left. Finally in the end he bit his teeth and stood at the end of the line, moving forward one step at a time in torment.</p>
<p>After the signing of the “Hundred Year Armistice Convention”, international conflicts were to be solved with combat in the virtual game world. But, there are countless virtual reality games in the world, for fairness, the “Convention” is updated every ten year. The content of the update is only the designated virtual game world. Which means that in the next ten years, if there is a problem that needs to use fighting to settle it, it can only be done in the designated game world to decide the outcome. This would evidently cause the game designated by the “Convention” to sweep across the entire world, even to cause the countries to greatly encourage citizens to enter the game and expend large amounts of financial resources and effort to build up the overall level of players along with most importantly, the top tier players. Besides the few pacifistic small countries, most of the countries are like this. Over time, small scale virtual reality games slowly fell out of favor. In the end, besides the designated virtual reality games, all the other virtual reality games quietly disappeared, because, humanity only needs one “second world”.</p>
<p>As for the newly updated “Convention”, its new designated game is “Shen Yue” that still has two days before it goes online. Therefore, promotions related to “Shen Yue” covered the world’s corners, the Chinese government was also strongly promoting it. At the same time, like the previous chosen virtual reality games, the gaming equipment for “Shen Yue” is all completely free. When you go to receive it you only need to bring a DNA sample like hair, nail, etc, when you receive it the equipment will bind your DNA so only you can use it.</p>
<p>The reason “Shen Yue” is named so, the official explanation is: “The map for the world of “Shen Yue” is a near perfect crescent moon, eastern players will start at the east of the new moon, and western players will start at the west of the crescent moon. It is named ‘Shen Yue’ according to the beautiful shape of the map.”</p>
<p>The scorching sunlight tested Yun Feng’s near gone patience, his hand holding a strand of his sister’s hair. He grimaced in pain as he moved forward with the line, occasionally turning his head to look at the long line behind him to find some psychological comfort. As the eldest son of the president of China’s second biggest financial group, usually no matter what he wanted to do it was just a matter of opening his mouth, from when he was just a kid, this is actually the first time that he’s stopped under the intense sun for so long.</p>
<p>5…4…3…</p>
<p>Finally, in front of me stood only three people, Yun Feng once again let out a small sigh. Glancing at the receptionist, even though she was sweating profusely she still showed a professional smile. He mumbled quietly: “Looks pretty nice, but compared to my sister, she’s virtually nothing.” (TL: Shame on you dirty minded people. He’s just making an observation. Tsk Tsk)</p>
<p>After a glance, he lost interest in continuing to look, randomly swinging his head, suddenly, his eyesight became fixed, mouth opened slightly, uncontrollably letting out a cry: “What a cute girl!”</p>
<p>What he saw was a face of pure beauty, a girl just like an angel. He believed that no matter who saw her, they would all be amazed and captured by her delicate face of almost surreal beauty. She looked to be already 15, 16 years old, holding onto a stick of ice cream that was just as white as her skin, eating it sweetly. The corners of her mouth forming a light smile that would melt you heart, her eyes that blinked from time to time were like shining crystals. He was confident, never in his life time had he seen such pure eyes.</p>
<p>The image in his vision so beautiful it seemed unreal, Yun Feng’s vision actually became sluggish for a while… she was like an angel that walked out of a picture, her beauty and pureness shouldn’t belong in this world, because this’s world’s polluted air would only dirty her.</p>
<p>Behind him came a light push, only then did Yun Feng awaken from his stupor. He quickly moved forward a small step, lined up behind the last two people in front of him. Yun Feng shook his head, looking at the girl again… he only now noticed, that girl was surprisingly sitting in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful girl, once she grows up she might even be above Meng Xing. Un… wheelchair? This girl, is she maybe sick, or maybe has a disability?</p>
<p>Wait…</p>
<p>That abnormally pale face…</p>
<p>Isrock!!</p>
<p>Yun Feng’s pupil slightly contracted… he was certain, that girl was infected with the world’s most terrifying disease…Isrock.</p>
<p>“Sigh, should you say that god is just, or simply cruel… giving her a face that is destined to become a startling beauty, but having to take away her life so early. ” Yun Feng secretly sighed, taking back his gaze of pity, a little unbearable to again look at the girl whose life was doomed to wither early, then taking a look at the person pushing her forward.</p>
<p>The moment he saw that person’s face, it was like Yun Feng has been struck by lightning, he stood there absolutely stunned.</p>
<p>That is a young man who looks to be in the early 20s, a tall frame, his facial features very sharp and defined, faintly emitting a pressing aura. He pushes the wheel chair moving forward, his footsteps slow and uniform, afraid that his movements would be too large alarming the girl in front. Seemingly sensing Yun Feng’s stare, his face suddenly turned around, immediately, Yun Feng saw a pair of eyes as cold as a dead star, the moment his eyesight focused on him, he even felt as though his eyes had been pricked by a sharp sword.</p>
<p>The man’s gaze only stopped on him for a split second before retracting his eyes, refocusing on the girl in front, along with it, his look also became very soft…that is the look of a person looking at the most important person in their life.</p>
<p>This person… this look… he… he is…</p>
<p>“Big brother, ice cream.” The girl turned around, raising up high the slightly eaten ice cream, putting it at the man’s lips. The man smiled slightly, slightly lowered his head, taking a small bite from where the girl had left a lip print. The girl smile innocently, taking back the ice cream and then biting the area the man had just bitten before.</p>
<p>Yun Feng was horrified, almost unable to resist charging at them. Even though there were continuously less people infected with Isrock after the development of the vaccine, and the spreading of it was also greatly controlled. But, even if you received the vaccine you would not be 100% safe. That girl clearly has contracted Isrock, is that man not afraid of getting infected… Isrock is spread through all kinds of body fluids, even spit, this is common knowledge even for children!</p>
<p>“Big brother, let’s get home faster okay, it’s so hot outside and I’m worried that my sweat is going to dirty the shirt brother just washed for me.</p>
<p>“Un (嗯), sure.”</p>
<p>The duo’s figures and voices were gradually leaving Yun Feng further away, Yun Feng’s eyes followed them in the direction they were heading, he was not looking at the overly refined girl, but at the man.</p>
<p>Are they siblings?</p>
<p>Wait! What am I thinking!</p>
<p>Yun Feng knocked on his head, when he brought his head back up, the man was already very far from him, vanishing at the corner of the street while pushing the wheelchair.</p>
<p>Crap…</p>
<p>In front of him stood the last person before him, the one hour that he suffered through was about to bare fruit. Shaking the warm sweat on his head, Yun Feng was so anxious that his mouth started twitching, finally with a bite of his teeth, he ran out of the queue, quickly running in the direction that the man vanished.</p>
<p>“Is this guy an idiot?” The fatty lined behind Yun Feng the whole time stared at his back, mumbling a bit. Right when it was almost his turn after enduring through such torture, he actually just left like that. If there’s nothing wrong with him what else could it be?</p>
<p>Running to the corner, Yun Feng once more saw the silhouette of the man, he let out a long breath, but thinking about his abnormal, sharp gaze from last time, he didn’t dare to get too close. Instead, he followed behind from far away, carefully looking at their figures advance.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later, the man pushed the girl entering a high end villa section. Yun Feng was surprised for a bit, but then let out an understanding chuckle… how could a person of his level lack money.</p>
<p>Still not daring to follow too closely, Yun Feng did not enter the area, continuing to wait for the two figures to disappear from his sight, after that he charged into the community’s security room, asking politely: “Uncle, what number villa do the siblings just now live in? It’s like this, I want to get to know that little girl, hehe (嘿嘿)…” Yun Feng pretended to give a shy laugh after he was done talking.</p>
<p>The old uncle glanced at him, immediately showing an expression of understanding. He turned his face, shaking his head saying: “They live in number 12, but I advise you to stop thinking about that girl. Sigh (唉) that girl is outrageously pretty, but her life is too harsh. Her father is a doctor, specifically interacting with Isrock patients, if you stand by the river often, how can you not get your shoes wet. A few years ago, her father eventually became infected, it’s just that at that time he and his family didn’t know. By the time they found out, that girl’s mother along with herself had all been infected… Two years ago her father and mother died in succession. leaving behind just the two brother and sister. The two siblings moved here after the death of their parents, maybe the father left a large heritage before going. Sigh, anyway, if you still want to live for another two years then don’t have any thoughts about the girl. Nobody is willing to get close to the number 12 villa she lives in, even the people that lived in the nearby villas moved away afraid to come back. Once you are infected by that illness, death is guaranteed. Actually it’s admirable the girl’s brother, taking care of a little sister that has Isrock and still never abandoning her, although he surprisingly hasn’t been infected.</p>
<p>The old uncle let out multiple sighs, clearly feeling sorry for the girl’s fate.</p>
<p>So it is Isrock… Yun Feng nodded his head, shouting: “Thanks uncle”, and then ran away unable to wait under the uncle’s strange stare.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“…Immediately investigate all the information about the residents of the tian yuan district’s number 12 villa, go quick, it has to be done before the afternoon today… Pay attention, you must not allow the residents to know what you are doing.”</p>
<p>Putting down the phone, Yun Feng clenched his slightly trembling hands, crying out quietly in excitement: “It’s him, it’s definitely him, the only person during that time in “Tian Tu” (Heaven Slaughter) that could exchange blows with ‘Xia Wa’ (summer child) for half an hour and not lose. Appearances can be similar… but no other person could have that eye expression! Not to mention just perfectly he has a sister with Isrock…”</p>
<p>“My little sister that gives people a headache, your big bro me is about to give you a big surprise this time!”</p>
<p>Two hours later…. (TL: Read it like they would in Spongebob. If you don’t know what I’m talking about then I pity your childhood.)</p>
<p>“…That man’s name is Ling Chen, the girl is Ling Shui Ruo. Two years ago they moved here from Zhong Zhou city, most likely to be able to better treat Isrock. We went to the hospital to check her medical records, that girl has already been infected with Isrock for three whole years. Her parents were infected around the same time and both died after only one year, yet that girl has tenaciously persisted until now. The doctor says that she has a very strong will to live… though, the Isrock virus has already spread throughout her entire body, no matter how strong she is, at most, she only has three more months left… Also, there’s rumor that Ling Chen was adopted by the Ling couple six years ago. He is not a blood relative with Ling Shui Ruo, the authenticity of the information is still to be confirmed… Young Master, that is all the data at the moment.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough.” Yun Feng closed the video chat and took a look at the time. Standing up, after pacing around the room for a bit, he opened the door and jogged out. Right now he couldn’t wait for a single moment.</p>
<p>This kind of affair, naturally he has to do it himself.</p>
<p>Entering the house, Ling Chen as usual carried his sister’s soft body, gently placing her on her special little bed in the middle of the living room. Bending his body, Ling Chen poked the tip of Shui Ruo’s nose, saying as he smiled: “Ruo Ruo, are you hungry? What do you want to eat?”</p>
<p>” I just had ice cream, I’m not hungry.” Ling Shui Ruo shook her head, she then blinked her gem like eyes, opening her arms,making a hugging motion towards her brother: “Big brother, it’s still so hot, can you first carry me to take a bath?</p>
<p>“Sure.” Ling Chen smiled as he carried Shui Ruo again, walking in the direction of the bathroom. The Isrock Virus had already spread throughout Ling Shui Ruo’s body, The strength of her body is almost worse than that of a 2,3 year old child, furthermore she’s lost the ability to walk. All of her movement, are all accomplished by wheelchair and Ling Chen’s arms. She loved the feeling of being carried in his embrace, every time at this moment, her eyes would be closed, using what was left of her energy to snuggle closely to him, listening to his heartbeat, smelling his scent.</p>
<p>Ling Chen supported the house by himself, washing clothes, cooking, cleaning… all the household chores belonged to him. The rest of his time he spent it all accompanying Shui Ruo, almost never willing to allow her to leave his sight.</p>
<p>Two year ago, when he came to Beijing with Shui Ruo, he had already decided that before Shui Ruo left him, he would spend every minute, every second by her side. Maybe, before he met her, he would never believe that one day he would go to such an extent for a girl.</p>
<p>(TL: This is a very pure scene. Those with dirty thoughts shall forever be banished from this realm)</p>
<p>In the clean, wide bathroom, Ling Shui Ruo had her eyes closed, her long eyelashes shaking slightly, allowing her brother to gently take off her clothes, and then with a practiced motion untie her light blue bra. A cold feeling rushed at the front of her bosom, she opened her eyes, looking at her white soft breast exposed in the air, crystal clear like two inverted jade bowls, the tip, two light colored buds so soft and pink that you almost couldn’t bear to touch them.</p>
<p>As for this beautiful scene that is enough to make any man’s blood boil, only her and the man behind are able to admire it, A pair of hands surrounded her from under her arms, carefully cupping her soft white breasts, gently starting to rub them. Ling Chen stuck to her neck from behind, admiring her soft, sleek neck, tenderly saying: “Ruo Ruo, it seems like they got bigger again.”)</p>
<p>“Then… does brother like it?” Ling Shui Rui lightly pursed her tender lips, her chest lightly moving up and down with his caress, her cheeks rouged, light pants coming from her mouth, her eyes slowly becoming blurred.</p>
<p>“Ruo Ruo is the most beautiful girl in the world, every part of Ruo Ruo’s body is perfect, of course I like it.” Ling Chen smile as he said so, a gentle kiss falling upon her thin, tender lips, which slowly slid towards her radiant cheeks, Ling Shuo Ruo’s skin as if made of nephrite (soft jade), slightly clear, smooth and soft like an infant’s.</p>
<p>His hands moved from her chest, slowly moving down, gently taking off the aqua blue underwear, revealing her bewitching, curvaceous body. Two long slender legs flashing a crystalline luster, her soft, round buttocks unspeakably ravishing. Ling Chen picked her up gently, placing her within the bath tub that was already filled with warm water.</p>
<p>Even though he spent all of his time with her and was already very familiar with ever inch of her body, even so, every time they met like this his conviction would always be put under a heavy trial. He calmed down his thoughts, fingers bringing along with it warm water as he softly stroked her body, sliding across her sleek neck, smooth shoulders, soft bosom, thin waist, white slender legs… His motion slow and soft as if caressing a glass doll that would break upon touching itL</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo had her eyes closed, like a cute kitten snuggling against his chest, enjoying his loving caress on her body. When the temperature of the water gradually grew colder, she opened her eyes, saying cheerlessly: “Brother, the doctor said at most I can live for another three months, is that true?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s hand paused for a moment, he held her small hands, smiling he asked: “Does Ruo Ruo believe it?”</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo shook her head strongly: ” I don’t believe it, I still haven’t completed the oath I made to brother, how could I die.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes became covered in a hazy mist, he hurriedly closed his eyes for a while, making the mist that had just risen dissipate,, so that Shui Ruo couldn’t see it. He tightly hugged the young girl before him, saying softly: “That’s why, Ruo Ruo has to work hard, up until the day you marry me, okay?”</p>
<p>He will never forget the promise that Shui Ruo made to him using her slightly childish voice when she was 12: “When I grow up, I have to marry big brother…” This amazing promise, became her motivation to never change this entire time.</p>
<p>But now, Isrock has made her most lovely wish, into an impossible reality. That she could endure until now, is enough to demonstrate how strong she is, but, he knew, Shui Ruo’s vitality at the moment was as weak as a young blade of grass, a slightly stronger wind or rain could inadvertently take away her life. Just one hour ago, the doctor used what seemed to him as a cruel voice, telling him: “At most she has three months… this is also under the most optimistic conditions. Once she falls asleep, there’s always the chance that she’ll never wake up. That she has persisted until now is already a miracle, give up…”</p>
<p>Give up? He (呵)… how could he give up!</p>
<p>“Un, I will keep trying, I will try as hard as I can to endure until that day… but, can you agree to one of my requests?” Ling Shui Ruo flashed her eyes, asking softly.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“If… if I can’t endure until that day, you can’t be sad for too long, especially not lonely, and then, big brother has to find a beautiful, gentle, kind girl who likes brother to take care of you, always by your side, okay?” Ling Shui Ruo nestled in his chest, saying dreamlike words.</p>
<p>Ling Chen bit his lips hard… Words like these, the strong Shui Ruo had never said them before. Evidently, she knew the she no longer had the strength to continue surviving. He shook his head, using a slightly trembling low voice he cried out: “Ruo Ruo, don’t say such silly things, I will surely… definitely not let you leave me!!”</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo did not speak again, she snuggled in his embrace, enjoying every precious moment with him.</p>
<p>Mama said, after people die, they will go to a place called Heaven, that place is very cozy, very peaceful, it will make everyone happy. But, there is no big brother there…</p>
<p>A place without big brother, how can it be Heaven.</p>
<p>I really want to keep living, living until the day that I can marry big brother… and then spending my entire life with him, I never want to see him hurt or lonely…</p>
<p>After feeding Shui Ruo lunch, he carries her back to her bed in her room, gently kissing her forehead and quietly withdraws. Everyday at this time Ling Shui Ruo sleeps. Carriers of Isrock need large amounts of sleep so as to reduce the loss of vitality up to a certain extent, or else it will quicken the time of death.</p>
<p>Glancing at the time, Ling Chen sits on the sofa, turning on the television. He usually doesn’t watch t.v., and doesn’t pay much attention to anything besides stuff related to Isrock treatment. When Ling Ruo Shui contracted Isrock, he invested all of his time and energy on her.</p>
<p>“…The world of ‘Shen Yue’ will open up this month on the 7th at nine in the morning throughout the entire world at the same time. ‘Shen Yue’ is once again another landmark in the history of virtual world gaming, it will show to all players a mysterious world that surpasses imagination…”</p>
<p>Randomly flipping through a couple channels, they were all related to “Sheh Yue” promotions. Ling Chen turned off the t.v., half lying on the couch, eyes squinted, lightly letting out a breath of air. Right now all of his thoughs are about Ling Shui Ruo, whatever “Shen Yue”, whatever virtual game world, all of it had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>“Big brother! Big Brother, hurry and wake up, you’ll get a horrible burn lying on the ground like that. Big brother…””</p>
<p>“I don’t have water… will this do? It’s very cooling, and very sweet…”</p>
<p>“Is it tasty? If it tastes good then drink the rest of it o (哦)…”</p>
<p>“Nn…mama, why did you carry me aside, big brother is thirsty, he really wants to drink water…mama, papa, can you guys save him please? Papa, you’re a great doctor, you’ll definitely save him right…”</p>
<p>Ruo Ruo, that year, you called me back from the border of death. But this time, what should I use to save your life.</p>
<p>“Ding Dong…”</p>
<p>“Ding Dong…”</p>
<p>The sound of the doorbell that rang in his ears made Ling Chen open his eyes, sit up straight and slightly tighten his forehead. In this area, almost ever resident knows that an Isrock carrier lives in the number 12 villa, and so, his house practically never gets visitors, people don’t even dare to get close, the sound of the doorbell hadn’t been heard in a long time. What he cared more about though, was whether or not the noisy doorbell would wake up Shui Ruo who was sleeping.</p>
<p>Okay, I’d like to clarify that this is not an erotica. So there might be a few more scenes like that in the future. I’m most likely just going to briefly mention them and then move on. I only did the full translation this time because it was the first time. Moving on…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>P.S.:Xia Wa has been changed to Eve in the future chapters. I won’t be changing the name in all the previous chapters. I’m just leaving a note here so people don’t get confused.</p>
<p>Opening the door, outside stood a man of similar age and body frame, he had a remarkable disposition, one look at his clothes and you could tell they were not your regular brand. Seeing Ling Chen appear, the man subconsciously took a small step back, his face showing an expression that resembled a mix of excitement and nervousness.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Ling Chen said asked after sizing him up. He’d seen this person… Before when he was returning with Shui Ruo, he once glimpsed this person. Ling Shui Ruo may have only been 16 years old, but she was already a stunning beauty, becoming the focus point of all eyes no matter where she went, so he didn’t care much at the time. But now, this man has randomly come knocking on their door.</p>
<p>“Ling… Ling Chen, hi, hello… I know your name is Ling Chen…” The moment he opened his mouth, Yun Feng couldn’t help but want to slap himself a couple of times, he interacted with all kinds of important figures on a daily basis, even face to face with China’s highest leader he did not feel nervous, yet in front of this man who was of a similar age, he was actually so worthless that he couldn’t even put together a proper sentence.</p>
<p>Yun Feng suppressed the excitement in his heart as fast as he could, proceeding to speak seriously: “I know you don’t know me. My visit here was also very presumptuous of me, but I honestly do have a very important affair. Oh right, first let me introduce myself, my name is Yun Feng, um… can I come in and talk with you?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen looked at his eyes staring for a second, expressionlessly replying: “My house is contaminated with the Isrock virus, do you still want to enter?”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, I just got the vaccine last month.” Yun Feng hurriedly said.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows that at the moment the Isrock virus vaccine has yet to be perfected, it cannot guarantee complete safety… like this, are you certain you still want to come in?”</p>
<p>“Certainly for sure and absolutely!” Yun Feng responded without any hesitance as before.</p>
<p>Ling Chen looked at him again, silent for a few seconds, turning around and returning to the living room: “Come in then,”</p>
<p>Yun Feng as if hearing the voice of an angel, walked in filled with joy, lightly closing the door behind him, the moment the door closed, he couldn’t help but silently laugh at himself: It looks like I’m still too young, when meeting the person that I worship my heartbeat still speeds up, behaving in an uncontrollable manner.</p>
<p>The living room is set up very simply, but is extremely clean. Yun Feng moved very carefully, when Ling Chen sat down, he followed him and sat down before him, opening his mouth first saying,: “I’ll introduce myself again, my name is Yun Feng, I am…”</p>
<p>“What do you want from me?” Ling Chen bluntly interrupted him.</p>
<p>Looking at Ling Chen close up, meeting his gaze, Yun Feng’s heartbeat became increasingly faster, he was also more certain that Ling Chen is that person. Because, that was the sharpest gaze in his whole life that he’d witnessed, a gaze practically sharper than a blade’s edge. Under his expressionless gaze, Yun Feng had a slight feeling of suffocation, he took in a breath, saying: “The reason I’m here, is because I want to make a deal with you… don’t reject it yet, I’m confident that you will be very interested in this deal.”</p>
<p>“Deal?” Ling Chen slightly creased his eyebrows. The reason he let this person in, is because he didn’t feel any ill intent or danger from him. As for a deal, he never made deals with other people lightly, because…</p>
<p>“Correct!” Yun Feng nods his head, he then started to say: “The day after tomorrow is the opening of ‘《Shen Yue》, I’m sure you know this, what I want…” Yun Feng’s voice started to become excited: “I want to invite you to join a gaming studio… a(啊) no, it’s a game guild, just at the moment it’s kinda small.”</p>
<p>“Not interested. I lost the time to play those kinds of things a long time ago, you can leave now.” Ling Chen rejected him without any hesitation, even instantly revealing an eye expression telling him to leave. Although, in his mind he was slightly puzzled as to why this person would specially come here to invite him into a game guild.</p>
<p>The virtual game world huh,… right now my world is only Shui Ruo, nothing can even think about splitting up the time that I spend with her.</p>
<p>“Wait.. Don’t, let me finish first!” Yun Feng quickly waved his hands, calming down his emotions he said: “Since it’s a deal, of course I will open up conditions that will make you satisfied. I know you have a sister with Isrock, these past few years you’ve been running around trying to cure her illness, then, there is an item that you should be very interested in.” Yun Feng’s expression became serious, slowly speaking a name: “13223 drug!”</p>
<p>(TL: No bashing plz, this is very serious.)</p>
<p>Hu (呼)…</p>
<p>Ling Chen who was always as calm as a still pond abruptly stood up from the sofa as if suddenly being pricked by a needle, his eyes closely locked on Yun Feng: “You… say that again!”</p>
<p>Before, Yun Feng had already seen the tender love that Ling Chen had towards his sister, his current reaction was completely within his predictions. He stood up, staring straight at his eyes, using his clearest voice: “13223 drug! This is what I offer for the deal!”</p>
<p>“That medicine, there’s only 13 bottles in the world!”</p>
<p>“No, initially there were 13, of them 10 bottles have already been consumed, right now there are only the last 3 bottles in the world, and one of them, just happens to be in my hands.”</p>
<p>“You… who are you?” Only now did Ling Chen begin to careful evaluate this person. His body trembled a bit, his hands especially so. The were simply very few things in this world that could pull on his heart-strings, and the name “13223 drug” was like a clap of thunder in his heart. Because, at the moment it is a special medicine with the strongest effect in curing Isrock, as long as a person with Isrock uses it, they can force the Isrock virus to enter a state of deep sleep for ten whole years. Within those ten years, the afflicted person will be completely free of the Isrock virus’ effects, their immune system and vitality will be slowly restored, their body will also return to a healthy state… until ten years later when the virus reawakens.</p>
<p>Its significance, is not simply the extension of one’s life by ten years. With Earth’s continually advancing medical science, within ten years time, it is very probable to have found a method to fully overcome the Isrock virus. At that time, even if infected again, it will no longer be so terrifying and hopeless.</p>
<p>There were only 13 of this medicine in the world, the professor who invented this medicine was assassinated before being able to produce a 14th bottle (TL: It’s a CONSPIRACY!), along with his death the formula for the 13223 drug became a mystery. Very few people know of the drug, Ling Chen is one of them, all these years, he has never stopped looking for the 13223 drug, yet no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t find anything. After all, there were only 13 in the world.</p>
<p>“Yun Feng… number one successor of the Yun family financial group. Don’t know if I have the qualifications to attain one of the bottles of the 13223 drug with my status.” Yun Feng said seriously.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“At the time my clan, through many hardships managed to acquire that bottle of the 13223 drug, it was to save my grandfather who had suddenly contracted Isrock, but, when we finally got it, grandfather had already passed away. My father in his anguish, randomly gave it to me… right now, its in my hands. If you agree to my request, then, that bottle of the 13223 drug, I will quickly deliver it to you.”</p>
<p>“I agree!” Ling who had rejected Yun Feng instantly, now agreed with an even more determined voice. As long as he could save Shui Ruo, he is able to put in any amount of effort and accept and kind of price.</p>
<p>Gaining Ling Chen’s agreement, Yun Feng was so excited that he almost jumped out of the chair. He patted his roaring chest, saying: “Hehe, that you could agree, it’s just so good, very good… en(呃), speaking of which, you must be puzzled as to why I would come make this deal with you?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded his head, his appearance calm, but in his heart he to was extremely excited… 13223 drug, the item that he dreamed of, to think that it would come to him on its own, it’s just, such a valuable item, will the trading conditions really be easy?</p>
<p>Yun Feng stood straight, hid eyes slightly raised, the scenery that he could never forget appearing in his mind, he said slowly: “3 years ago, Yun Tan Mountain (dark cloud), you, me, Xia Wa.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen paused for a bit, following that, an image that he had long ago buried deeply in his memory surfaced in his mind, his face exhibiting a deeply surprised expression: “You… you’re the one who witnessed the battle between me and Xia Wa at that time, Lun Hui Feng Xue(Cycle of Wind and Snow)?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Yes! it’s me, that’s me!!” Seeing that Ling Chen actually remembered his name, Yun Feng’s blood pressure hit the roof. “You don’t know, even though I wasn’t able to witness who lost and who won in the end, but after seeing that fight, I couldn’t get a good night’s sleep for three days… That was a true historic, legendary, battle of the strongest! I couldn’t imagine before that, us China, to think existed someone who could fight with Xia Wa for so long and not lose. Even luckier, when your mask was knocked away by Xia Wa, I saw your face… Ah(啊), don’t worry, even though I’ve been constantly trying to find you, I never told anyone about anything related to you. Even though I once told some of my friends that a person appeared in China that could rival Xia Wa… they didn’t believe me for a second. Though thinking about it, if I hadn’t seen it personally, if someone else told me about it, I probably wouldn’t believe it either.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen sat back on the sofa, sighing in his mind. He finally understood the reason why Yun Feng looked at him with that overly fervent gaze. (TL:Wow, wasn’t it obvious that he wants you) Who would have thought, three years ago in that world of 《Heaven Slaughter》, that swordsman climbing Dark Cloud Mountain who had happened upon the battle between him and Xia Wa, would recognize him three years later, and come find him on his own, giving him the item of his dreams.</p>
<p>Is this an arrangement of fate? Is god taking back his cruelty, no longer making him and Shui Ruo seperate…</p>
<p>“As long as you can bring the 13223 drug, I can agree to any of your conditions… although, you have to tell me first what exactly it is you want me to do?” Ling Chen said.</p>
<p>“Relax, you’re the only person that I’ve ever revered, I would never use the 13223 drug to coerce you into doing anything horrible. Actually, the reason I’m doing this is the same as you,” Yun Feng returned in front of Ling Chen, and then let out a faint breath: “Like you I’m doing this for my little sister.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Oh?” A hint of interest in Ling Chen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Yun Feng calmed his expression, breathing out a light sigh: “Here’s how it is… Like you I have a little sister, younger than me by 2 years. Maybe, you people think that the life of the upper class people would be luxurious and rich… Yes, often time we are easily able to obtain what others couldn’t even hope to, but, there are also a lot of things that others can easily gain that we are destined to walk away from… like our marriage. In this regard, under the influence of the countless chains of benefit, we essentially have no freedom.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“My little sister’s name is Yun Meng Xin, three years ago, the eldest son of a very powerful political family set his eyes on her, swearing in front of my father and his that he would marry nobody but her. That family really has a lot of power, if our families could link together, it would be of great help towards our family. At the time, this for my father, and for the family’s elders was a huge surprise, my father promised on the spot to marry over Meng Xin when she turned 21… and so, my sister’s marriage was decided like that, without asking for her opinion… and without the need to.”</p>
<p>“You sister doesn’t want to?” Ling Chen asked. To allow for the Yun family financial group to value so greatly this marriage, even feeling overwhelmed, exactly how great is this families power? He also thought of silently, if his own sister Shui Ruo was forcefully engaged in such a manner… Thinking up to there, his gaze grew cold, a strong killing intent flashing across his eyes.</p>
<p>A random chill made Yun Feng shiver unnaturally, he felt his forehead, not thinking too much about it: “More than just unwilling, she’d practically rather die. At the time her reaction wasn’t so strong, but over the years she had been observing this person, really if you look at his looks, his family background, his ability, the behavior that he displays, he could almost be considered a perfect human. But, that person is very conniving, and completes objectives at any cost, a ruthless figure… especially, he only sees women as playthings. My sister 100% refuses to spend the remainder of her life with such a person, strongly fighting against this marriage. But my parents along with all of the family’s elders are set on the marriage, they would never listen to her… If the marriage is successful, it would bring the clan great benefits that would continue for many years, if unsuccessful… it might even bring about revenge from that clan. Under such a contrast, why would they even pay attention to my sister’s protests… Ultimately, all they think of my sister as is a trading product that can bring about huge benefits.</p>
<p>“How does this have any connections as to why you want me to join a gaming guild in 《Mystic Moon》?” Ling Chen asked,</p>
<p>“There is, there is a huge relation.” Yun Feng quickly said: “Because, that guild is founded by my sister, that is her last hope of fighting against the marriage… though, it’s just that before meeting you, the chances were very slim.”</p>
<p>“You’re saying?”</p>
<p>“My sister’s personality has always been stubborn since she was little, under her increasingly intense resistance… one month ago, she and my father made a bet. A bet that for her, was essentially impossible for her to win. The conditions were set by my father, he said, if my sister could garner a reputation and fortune that could rival the entire Yun family financial group within two years, then , he will recognize that she has the power and freedom to decide her own future, no one will be able to interfere with her life anymore, if not, then she has to quietly follows the arrangements of the clan, marrying that person two years later, not allowed to have any complaints or resistance.”</p>
<p>“The Yun family financial group has used at least 100 years to develop to its current state. To think that your father wants a girl to reach such a height within two year, who knew there was such a shameless bet in the world.” Ling Chen gave a laugh of disdain.</p>
<p>“Indeed, not only that, everyone in the clan… including me, including all financial and political relations are not permitted to give her any financial help or conveniences., everything has to depend on her. The reason my father did so, really was so that my sister would give up all hope. But, that stubborn little sister of mine… sill agreed. The family cut off all her sources of income. Her final decision, and what could be said as her only choice, is the about to open world of 《Mystic Moon》. Speaking to the end, Yun Feng’s face revealed a pained expression. He couldn’t forget how his dearest little sister would always show a strong, stubborn… yet deeply hidden lost and helpless expression.</p>
<p>“You want me to help your little sister?” At this point, Ling Chen now completely understood the reason Yun Feng approached him.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Yun Feng nods his head.</p>
<p>“Allowing her to have a fortune and reputation equal the Yun family financial group within 2 years, you think just because of me it can be done?” Ling Chen asked without expression.</p>
<p>“I believe you can… If there is only one person in the entire world who can do it, I believe, it can only be you.” Yun Feng said solemnly.</p>
<p>“And you believe me that much? Just how much do you understand me? Simply because you saw that battle three years ago against Xia Wa?”</p>
<p>“I believe my eyesight, I especially believe in my ability to judge people. To be honest, having you join my sister’s guild, I also have my own motives… I’ve always want to witness once more the figure that you displayed, allowing everyone to know that we China have a god class player who is equal to Xia Wa, making the western players no longer able to look down on us… Three years, this dream of mine has never gone away.” Speaking to the last part, Yun Feng’s eyes became more and more fervent. (TL: Such nationalism, it almost brings a tear to my eyes.)</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s incredibly acute hearing picked up the breathing that was becoming a bit less even in the next room. He knew that the sleeping Shui Ruo was already awake. He said: “I understand now, at the right time, take me to see her, I will join her guild, and then help her as you wished.”</p>
<p>“Okay!!” Yun Feng nods his head, so excited that the palm of his hands were covered in sweat. He stuck his hands in his pocket, taking out a tightly sealed metallic little box, placing it in front of Ling Chen; “Inside is the 13223 drug, the code is 08177180, I swear on my pride and honor, it is absolutely not fake.”</p>
<p>The little metallic box was held within Ling Chen’s hands, Yun Feng could clearly see his hands trembling excitedly, he was holding the box so carefully, as if it was a brittle piece of glass that would break if touched.</p>
<p>He truly saw his sister as more important than his life… Even though she is infected with a terminal disease, her father dead, but with a brother like this, she is still happy. Yun Feng sillently thought.</p>
<p>Ling Chen lifted his head, looking at Yun Feng, the coldness in his eyes gone, he asked: “Giving it to me right now, are you not afraid that I will go back on my promise, are you not afraid that I am a bad person, who will repay your kindness with evil?”</p>
<p>Yun Feng smiled: “An apex master who can fight evenly with Xia Wa, a person that can take care of his Isrock infected sister without ever leaving her side, would he be a promise breaking, ungrateful low life? I believe you, and believe my eyesight and heart.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen stood up, extending his hand towards Yun Feng, giving him an absolute promise: “You will not regret the words that you said today.”</p>
<p>Yun Feng extended his hand and grasped Ling Chen’s, gaining his promise, his heart was very excited: “I too believe, I will not regret today’s decision.”</p>
<p>“But, before this, I have two additional conditions.” Ling Chen said.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s expression became serious again: “First, even though I will join your sister’s guild, I will not meet her irl, I will also not use my true face to meet people, you also cannot tell anyone anything related to me. I don’t want the peace of me and my sister to be disturbed.”</p>
<p>“No problem.” Yun Feng patted his chest saying, Before coming here, He already thought that Ling Chen would have such a request. He believed that with his ability, if he entered the world of 《Mystic Moon》, his name would for sure spread across the entire world within a short time, if he didn’t hide his identity, his life would not be peaceful. Maybe he can disregard it, but based on the level of care he has for his sister, he would for sure not allow such a thing to happen.</p>
<p>“Secondly, me and my sister will join the guild together.” Lig Chen continued saying.</p>
<p>“This… obviously this is even less of of problem.” Yun Feng let out a small breath of relief. The two conditions that Ling Chen proposed couldn’t even be considered conditions. Adding an additional person, he couldn’t be happier. “Give me a strand of you and your sister’s hair or something, this afternoon, I will personally bring over the gaming equipment. Oh right, do you guys prefer a necklace or bracelet?”</p>
<p>The gaming equipment for 《Mystic Moon》 was split as two types, necklace and bracelet. You can directly put it around your neck or wear it on your wrist, the appearance is that of a small, intricate accessory. When gaming there is no need for internet connection, no need for any complicated controls, when gaming all you need to do is lie flat, and then close your eyes saying the command to enter the game. At the same time, the gaming device does not need to be recharged, even if you are in the game 24/7, the internal charge is more than enough to last 50 years and above.</p>
<p>“Bracelet.” Ling Chen replied.</p>
<p>“OK!” Yun Feng snapped his fingers. Initially he came her e nervous, but the process was more successful than he anticipated, he not only gained Ling Chen’s acceptance, but also his promise… Accepting and a promise, those are to entirely different concepts. All of it, originated from the love that Ling Chen had towards his sister that surpassed everything. Of course, there is also the unconditional trust that he demonstrated towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>“That um, can I have your number?”</p>
<p>“… Don’t have one.”</p>
<p>“Oh, ok, I’ll deliver two cellphones on the side in the afternoon, don’t worry, it will the one’s where the electromagnetic radiation is so small that you can completely ignore it .”</p>
<p>Taking over the DNA samples that Ling Chen gave, Yun Feng looked at the time, standing up saying: “Then, I will go prepare right now. I believe that you can save my sister… and will make the entire world change their expression because of us China.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen smiled: “Go do what you need to.”</p>
<p>Walking Yun Feng out of the house, from beginning to end, Ling Chen was always carefully holding the metallic box that carried the 13223 drug, as if scared that the moment it left his hands it would disappear. Seeing Yun Feng out the door, as he was about to return, Yun Feng suddenly turned around, and then slowly said a sentence: “Sigh, little sisters with big brother’s really are blessed.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After Yun Feng left, Ling Chen’s calm disposition immediately dissipated, He was essentially tripping over himself charging over to Shui Ruo’s room, nearly hitting his head on the door.</p>
<p>Opening the door, he saw that Ling Shui Ruo was already sitting on the bed, looking at him with an angelic smile: “Brother, who was that big brother just now? It seems like he told brother some impressive things… it’s really, really rare to see brother so excited.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen could practically hear his racing heartbeat, up until now, he still felt like he was in a dream. He sat beside Ling Shui Ruo, carefully placing the box on his knees… This was not a simple container, what he held in his hands, is the last hope to save the most cherished person in his life… a hope that when he was approaching despair, came from the heavens.</p>
<p>He has never like this moment thanked the heavens, thanked a person… Even though, Yun Feng gave him the 13223 drug under the form of a trade, but if it really can save Shui Ruo’s life, he will remember this kindness for his entire life, and will definitely complete his promise. Even though, rivaling the Yun family financial group within 2 years was really an overly large goal.</p>
<p>According to the code that Yun Feng gave, Ling Chen slowly opened the container, inside was a small, brown bottle as thick as a middle finger. Through the bottle. he saw the slightly swashing liquid within.</p>
<p>Taking out this little bottle that could save Shui Ruo’s life, Ling Chen used the lightest movements to slowly take of the cap, instantly, a strange smell wafted outwards. Ling Chen’s hands slightly trembled, he placed the little bottle at Shui Ruo’s lips, saying softly: “Here, Ruo Ruo, hurry up and drink it.”</p>
<p>Two small, soft hands grasped Ling Chen’s hands, only now did Ling Chen realize, Ling Shui Ruo who was just smiling now covered her face in tears, she lightly said: “Is this, what brother traded from that big brother? It… can let me live until the day that I marry brother?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen heavily nods his head, and then immediately shakes it: “Not only can it allow Ruo Ruo to live until the day that you marry brother, you will also make a complete recovery, being able to always stay with brother, until the day we grow old and leave.”</p>
<p>“Un!!” Ling Shui Ruo agreed with the most determined voice, bringing up her brother’s hand, opening her lips, allowing the cold liquid to fall through her teeth drop by drop.</p>
<p>“Drinking it down, I really won’t die, I won’t need to leave brother?”</p>
<p>Is it that even heaven, is unable to bear separating me and brother…</p>
<p>I’m not afraid of dying, but I am afraid of a world without brother, even more afraid of the pain and loneliness brother will feel after I leave…</p>
<p>These 3 years, brother used almost all of his time accompanying me, giving up so many, so many things, actually I always knew, brother has a lot of dreams, has a lot of things that he likes and wants to do, but for me, he gave them all up, brother’s kindness, I could never return it in my entire life… If, I really do get better, then, until the day that I die, I will always live for only brother, helping brother to whatever he wants to do. Even if one day brother becomes a horrible person that everybody hates and spits upon, I will always be by brother’s side, never leaving his side…</p>
<p>Brother, it’s you that gave me the reason to endure until now, after today, you will continue to be the only reason… that I live in this world…</p>
<p>The last drop of cold liquid tilted into her mouth, she closed her lips, swallowing the bitter liquid, she then opened her eyes, revealing the loveliest smile towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Ling Chen watched her finish drinking the medicine without ever taking his eyes off of her. Taking aside the empty bottle and container, he held Shui Ruo’s shoulders, asking concernedly: “Ruo Ruo, do you have some kind of special feeling?”</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo smiled softly: “Brother, this isn’t an elixir, it wouldn’t have such a fast effect… although, it seems like my body has a sort of hot feeling.”</p>
<p>“Lie down first, what you need the most right now is rest. Who knows, when you wake up, maybe you’ll already be able to get down the bed yourself and walk.” Putting down Shui Ruo’s body, pulling up the covers, Ling Chen said so smiling.</p>
<p>“Definitely!” Ling Shui Ruo smiled happily: “That Yun Feng big brother, he is a very good person, right?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was silent for a bit, nodding his head: “From his eyes, I couldn’t see any falsity. Or else, I wouldn’t have let you drink that medicine so assuredly.”</p>
<p>“Then, brother will do as you promised him, go inside that game world, and help that Meng Xin big sister, right?” Shui Ruo continued asking.</p>
<p>“Un… although, I will not leave behind Ruo Ruo, no matter where I am, I will always accompany Ruo Ruo.”</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo shook her head: “Brother, I’m not against it. Contrarily, actually, I’ve always been attracted to the virtual game world, because in that world, no matter how serious of an illness a person has, even those with a physical disability, inside there they will all have a perfect body. Inside I can just like a regular person run, shout, go anywhere I want, and fight fight with small creatures that aren’t the least bit scary. I can also see brother’s most dashing figure… He (嘻), I only just found out today, brother turned out to be an amazing person in the gaming world in the past, that Yun Feng brother said, brother is the only one who can battle against Xia Wa for a long time and not lose… Brother, the name Xia Wa is really weird, who is she?”</p>
<p>“Xia Wa…” Ling Chen said this name under his breath, scenes of impossible to forget images appearing in his mind, “She is a scary person, in a lot of ways, she is even scarier than the Isrock virus, she is the globally recognized… god among players.</p>
<p>“God?” Shui Ruo blinked her eyes: “Then did brother beat her in the end?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen shook his head: “No… there’s also probably no one in this world that can defeat her, although, I didn’t lose either. Three years ago, inside of the game 《Heaven Slaughter》, I challenged her to a fight, the location was chosen at Dark Cloud mountain where regular players would for sure be unable to climb, while we were fighting, unexpectedly, a player climbed up… it is that Yun Feng was just came to our house, His game name at the time was called ‘Lun Hui Feng Xue’. Fighting against Xia Wa, I couldn’t even be distracted, same with Xia Wa, so none of us paid attention to him, and allowed him to witness the battle between me and Xia Wa, in between, the mask I was wearing was destroyed by Xia Wa with a weapon that could destroy equipment, allowing Xia Wa and Yun Feng to see my face…” (TL: OP)</p>
<p>“And then…”</p>
<p>“And then… and then angry that Xia Wa destroyed my mask, I grabbed her really hard on the butt, and then turned and ran.” Thinking of the image at that time, Ling Chen gave a smug laugh. Obviously, his quick, perverted action was not seen by Yun Feng, or else… maybe he would worship him even more. Someone with the balls to touch Xia Wa’s butt, you probably couldn’t find a second person in the world. (TL: Because revenge is always sweetest from behind.)</p>
<p>“Haha.” Shui Ruo laughed covering her mouth.</p>
<p>“And then, Xia Wa kept chasing, Yun Feng also followed behind us running for his life, but his speed was far worse than ours, he was quickly left behind by us. After that Yun Feng didn’t know what happened. I probably ran for about half and hour, finally still getting caught up by Xia Wa, her gaze at that moment, she really wished she could chop me into 17, 18 pieces. When I thought we were going to fight again… 《Heaven Slaughter》 suddenly required maintenance, we were kicked offline. After that, until this day, I have yet to meet her again. Although…” His voice paused for a bit, an incredibly complex expression flashing across his face: “I guess she’s probably still looking for me right now.”</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo laughed: “So Xia Wa is a girl… brother took advantage of her, of course she has to find brother and get some pay back, when brother is in 《Mystic Moon》, you’ll have to be careful.”</p>
<p>Already forgetting how long ago being able to laugh so lightheartedly. All these years, Isrock has always been weighing on their hearts like a terrifying nightmare, and today, they could finally say goodbye to this nightmare — even if it’s just a temporary farewell. (TL:o.0) While laughing, they took in the fresh air and the bright sunlight from outside, in their hearts, quietly sketching a beautiful future.</p>
<p>Mystic Moon…</p>
<p>In the afternoon near the evening, Yun Feng covered in sweat delivered the game devices that belonged to Ling Chen and Ling Shui Ruo, at the same time bringing them each a communications device, even paying the communication fees. Ling Chen did not refuse, accepting it all. Before to avoid worsening Shui Ruo’s condition, he never used cell phones this kind of thing that has comparatively strong electromagnetic radiation. But now, if the Isrock virus in Shui Ruo’s body completely enters stasis, even using it often wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget, the day after tomorrow 9 o’clock in the morning. Oh right, even though you can’t enter the game right now, but you can already create you character, after creating it, remember to tell me your name.” Yun Feng told him before leaving.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s and Shui Ruo’s game devices were both a small and exquisite bracelet, Ling Chen’s red, Ling Shui Ruo’s aqua blue, also with a watch feature.</p>
<p>So character creation is already open?</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo was already quietly asleep, Ling Chen played around with the device for a while, finally lying on the couch, closing his eyes, using his thoughts to enter the command to enter the game.</p>
<p>Instantly, the game device on his wrist briefly flashed a bright light, in front of Ling Chen became a white space, his mind dazed for an instant, and then suddenly brightened, a world of intertwining colored lights presented itself in front of Ling Chen’s eyes. In the colorful world, a small and exquisite figure was flying towards him… That is a rainbow colored magic wand in hand, wearing rainbow colored clothes, little fairy only as big as a palm, accompanied by a sweet, crisp teenage girl’s voice.</p>
<p>“How do you do Mr. Ling Chen, welcome to the world of 《Mystic Moon》, until the world of Mystic Moon opens there is still the last 39 hours and 42 minutes, please wait patiently. This is your first time using the game device, do you want to create your character? Oh right, forgot to introduce myself, I am the smartest and cutest number 52000 receptionist fairy.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>From now on we’ll be learning a new word for “Me” every chapter. Yay!!!</p>
<p>At least, as long as google translate isn’t lying to me.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ling Chen responded. This game receptionist fairy’s voice was sweet and cute, you couldn’t hear any hint of electronic composition, her appearance was also faultless and intricate, making Ling Chen almost unable to resist grabbing her to closely examine if she was real or not.</p>
<p>“The Mystic Moon world is a vast, beautiful world, inside are kind citizens, cute animals, ferocious monsters…. and countless secrets waiting to be uncovered. I believe that Mr. Ling Chen will definitely fall in love with that place. Then, let’s start creating Mr. Ling Chen’s identity within Mystic Moon’s world. But you need to pay attention, once a character is created, it will be impossible to make changes, so you need to be cautious.”</p>
<p>Inside of the public promotions for 《Mystic Moon》, there is a point that is clearly described, that is in the world of 《Mystic Moon》 there is no chance to restart, saying it more straight forwardly, it is that there is no saying of being able to delete your account and re-level like in previous virtual reality games. Regardless of nickname, initial stats, class, once picked, it can never be changed. So, before entering 《Mystic Moon》, it becomes necessary to think about the direction of your class, because there is no second chance to pick.</p>
<p>“Then, please create your nickname first, because of the fact that your game region is in the China region, only Chinese characters are allowed, and cannot be less than one character and more than ten.” The receptionist fairy used her crisp, sweet voice to say.</p>
<p>“Ling… Tian…” (Above the Heavens)</p>
<p>“Wow… what a domineering name, Mr. Ling Chen, I like your name. Although, because China’s players are the most numerous, so it’s also the easiest for nicknames to repeat, please allow me to first check if there is someone else that is already using this name… Ya! Mr. Ling Chen, you’re so lucky, this name has yet to be taken, you’re name in 《Mystic Moon》 will be ‘Ling Tian’, are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“‘Ling Tian’ was successfully named. Then, next up is the pain reception rate option. The pain reception rate, is the amount if pain felt when a player is hurt in combat. Pay attention, it is only in combat, non-combat related bodily or physical contact will not be affected, and will only affect pain reception, no other senses will be affected. The choices for the pain reception rate ranges from 10% – 100%. High numbers are suitable for players looking for excitement and realism, but when attacked it will hurt a lot, those afraid of pain shouldn’t pick it ne. Low ranges can reduce the pain to very low, but there are also disadvantages, such as when being attack they will be unable to perform quick reactions, what is your choice?”</p>
<p>“10%.” Ling Chen replied without any hesitation, he was entering the game to fulfill a promise, not to suffer, only someone sick in the head would pick a high pain reception, and then torture themselves to death in a game world of fighting and killing.</p>
<p>“Pain reception rate successfully set. Next will be the initial stats choice.”</p>
<p>After the fairy’s voice, a wide stat page floated in front of Ling Chen’s eyes, on top were listed strength, constitution, agility, spirit these four options.</p>
<p>“Each player has 25 initial stat points, they can freely distribute them to strength, constitution, agility, spirit these four basic stats, each stat’s minimum is 5 , maximum is 10. Within, strength affects physical attack strength, constitution affection vitality and defense ability, agility affects hit rate and dodge, along with bow, pierce related class’s attack strength, spirit affects magic attack strength and mana. Each attribute has different influences towards different classes. Please choose wisely according to the path that you wish for your class to go ne.”</p>
<p>25 stat points, each attribute need’s to be at least 5 points, which also means that there are only 5 points that can be freely distributed. Standing in front of the stat page, Ling Chen thought for a long time, taking a step forward, increasing strength to 10, constitution, agility, spirit all staying at 5. In 《Heaven Slaughter》, the class he picked was the killer line of the assassin class, that was also the class that suited him most. Assassin’s have what could be said as the strongest single target battle strength, they can take a life in an instant without leaving a trace. But the flaws of the assassin are also very evident… That is their weak vitality and unspectacular group battle ability. The stats that he chose, determined that in the world of 《Mystic Moon》 he would be a warrior related class. Because this time he is not entering 《Mystic Moon》 to simply play, but to support a guild created by a girl. Peak single target battle strength kind of doesn’t seem fitting.</p>
<p>“Initial stats successfully distributed. Next please distribute your innate stats. Each player has 10 innate stats, they can be distributed to luck, comprehension these two innate attributes. Each attribute at the least can be 0 and 10 at the most. Innate stats are very valuable attributes, their upgrade can only be achieved through very rare items or special quests, and cannot be upgraded through leveling-up or equipment stats. The luck attribute is related to your luck in the Mystic Moon world, it touches upon drop rates, critical hit rates, pierce rates, the success of sudden events and multiple other areas. Comprehension touches upon your ability to understand in the Mystic Moon world, the higher the comprehension, the ability to grasp including life skills will become stronger, upgrade-able skills will upgrade faster. Once more emphasizing, the upgrade of innate attributes is very hard ne, please distribute cautiously.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen thought for a bit, making luck and comprehension both 5.</p>
<p>“Innate attributes successfully distributed. Mr. Ling Chen, I really like your choice, whether it’s solely chasing after extreme luck or comprehension, they are both not sensible. Initial stat distribution complete, next up, is your novice class decision. The world of Mystic Moon has 7 total basic classes: warrior, shield guard, archer, assassin, priest, mage, summoner, according to the initial stats that you just distributed, it is recommended that you choose the warrior the relies most on the strength attribute, and has the strongest physical attack strength. Please pick…”</p>
<p>“Apprentice warrior!” Ling Chen directly responded.</p>
<p>“Apprentice warrior class successfully chosen, the class you’ve chosen is apprentice warrior, warriors have strong material attack strength and varied forms of attack along with comparatively strong physical defense ability, an important asset in close range damage output, their movement, hit rate and ability to dodge are comparatively weak. After the first class advance you can become a true warrior. A warrior’s main\stats are strength, constitution, and a bit of agility. For warriors, each point of strength can increase two points of physical attack strength, each point of constitution can increase 10 points of HP and 1 point of defense, each point in agility can increase 1 point of dodge rate and 1 point of hit rate, each point in spirit can increase two point of magic attack strength and 10 points of MP.” (TL: Don’t know what one point of hit rate and dodge rate does but it doesn’t really matter. you’ll see.:))</p>
<p>After the fairy’s voice, a column of white light fell from the sky, enveloping Ling Chen’s body.</p>
<p>“Very good, you have now successfully become an apprentice warrior. But, this is only your training class, it is not your final class, if you want to change classes after leaving Novice Village, you can do that too ne.”</p>
<p>Finally finishing another reception, the little fairy let out a long breath of relief, patting her small chest saying: “Mr. Ling Chen, your identity in Mystic Moon has already been successfully created. From the opening of Mystic Moon there are still 39 hours, please wait patiently… then now, I’m going to lightly kick you out ne.”</p>
<p>Before Ling Chen could finish speaking, in front of him suddenly became black, the colorful world instantly fell apart, when he opened his eyes, what he saw was the house’s roof.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Ling Chen said helplessly, initially he wanted to compliment the little fairy about how “cute” she was, and then obtain from her mouth some game related knowledge and information. Who knew she was laughing happily at first, but then cleanly kicking him out later.</p>
<p>Not disturbing Shui Ruo’s sleep, Ling Chen started to pay attention to 《Mystic Moon》 related information on the computer. But after an afternoon of research, the amount of data that he gathered was pitifully little. The line mentioned the most in public promotions was — countless mysteries, waiting for you to personally uncover.</p>
<p>Xia Wa… hope I don’t meet you again. Closing his eyes, Ling Chen said so in his heart.</p>
<p>The second day, Yun Feng personally delivered again two of the most advanced life support machines, it can allow a person to stay in the game world continuously for one month without going offline. Even though they basically didn’t need it, but Ling Chen did not refuse. He knew that an upper class child like Yun Feng, these things couldn’t even be considered a single hair from nine oxen. But at least, he cared about him and his sister’s situation. (TL: Chinese idiom, same as “a drop in the ocean”)</p>
<p>“Have you created your character yet. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Ling Tian.” Ling Chen didn’t hide it, directly telling him.</p>
<p>“Very domineering!” Okay then, tomorrow we’ll meet in the game, I’ll contact you again at that time! Oh right, the effect’s of that 13223 drug will only take effect after 4,5 days, don’t worry, especially don’t think that I’ve tricked you. ” Yun Feng didn’t forget to mention before leaving.</p>
<p>Shui Ruo’s body was still weak, all movement depended on Ling Chen, Ling Chen believed that Yun Feng didn’t trick him, and also waited for the day that Shui Ruo completely recovered.</p>
<p>Night time…</p>
<p>Every night, Shui Ruo would only be able to sleep peacefully leaning against his chest. After Shuo Ruo fell asleep, Ling Chen gently gets up, opening the door, coming to the veranda, lifting his head, looking towards the crescent moon in the sky.</p>
<p>A gust of cold air swept across his face, moonlight flowing downwards, a black figure appearing by his side, that black figure knelt at his side, lowering his head towards him.</p>
<p>“Gui Ya (Ghost Fang), tomorrow, I will enter 《Mystic Moon》.”</p>
<p>The black figure shook a bit.</p>
<p>“Go now.”</p>
<p>The black figure stood up, jumping from the veranda, disappearing in the pitch black night without stopping. From beginning to end, there were only 2 lines of short interchange. But, that was already more than enough.</p>
<p>Under the world’s countless player’s eager awaiting, The day of 3100/07/07 finally arrived. The minute hand slowly approached morning 9 o’clock. At 9, 《Mystic Moon》 will open towards the entire world.</p>
<p>TL: Whelp, that about does it for the intro. Time to witness how goddamn mother freaking OP the MC is and watch him build up his harem.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Translator: 我 (Wo, woah) Chinese. Since it has been pointed out that google translate LIED to me. I shall pick a word that I know for certain is correct. Also, now that I seem to have some readers, I’ll be putting up some polls so check out the poll page. Also… I lied, still introduction.</p>
<p>Ling Chen rose a bit earlier than usual toady, and then as usual finished making breakfast, proceeding to wake up Shui Ruo, helping her wear her clothes, wash, comb her hair, taking care of her meticulously as if she were a new born baby. Shui Ruo looked a bit better today compared to yesterday, her mood also becoming happier… He told himself, this was definitely not an illusion caused by psychological reasons.</p>
<p>9:00 AM slowly approached, Ling Chen carried Shui Ruo back to the bed, covering her with a soft blanket that was pretty much changed everyday. Shui Ruo hugged his neck not willing to leave, speaking lightly beside his ears: “Brother, when my illness gets better, I will go to the game world and help that Yun Meng Xin big sister with brother, okay?”</p>
<p>“Of course it’s okay. So then, Shui Ruo needs to properly rest now, only then can you get better faster!” Ling Chen responded smiling. When a person is in the virtual game world, the brain enters a half-asleep state, if a long amount of time is spent inside, for normal people it wouldn’t even cause any damage to their bodies or minds. But right now for Shui Ruo no matter her vitality or mentality were both too weak, even inside the game world it would be easy for her mind to get tired. What she needs the most right now is large amounts of sleep.</p>
<p>“Un! I will definitely get better quickly!” Ling Shui Ruo nods her head heavily, a smile of hope and longing on her face.</p>
<p>After Ling Shui Ruo falls asleep, the opening of the Mystic Moon world is also entering its final countdown. Ling Chen glances at the time, lying on the living room’s sofa, closing his eyes, and entering the command to enter the game.</p>
<p>Immediately, the colorful world appeared in front of his eyes again, a similar little fairy flying over towards him:</p>
<p>“How do you do Mr. Ling Chen, welcome to your arrival, I am receptionist fairy number 96388, your identity in 《Mystic Moon 》 has already been created, from the opening of 《Mystic Moon》 there is still the last minute, please wait patiently ne.”</p>
<p>“… There are still the last 30 seconds, please wait patiently…”</p>
<p>“… There are still the last 20 seconds, please wait patiently…”</p>
<p>“…10, 9, 8… 3, 2, 1… Mr. Ling Chen, welcome to the world of 《Mystic Moon》, you have been allocated to Novice Village number 49554, I wish you a happy game experience.”</p>
<p>After the receptionist fairy’s voice, in front of Ling Chen became a spiraling scene, the scenery before his eyes quickly changing. When his vision finally became clear, he was already in the Novice Village, at the same time, noisy sounds that made his ear drums hurt were coming from the side of his ears.</p>
<p>Random white lights constantly flashed around him, every second there were large amounts of players being sent to surrounding places. Taking a look, besides people there were only people. In total the China region set up 100 thousand Novice Villages, it is the battle area with the most Novice Villages in the world, but due to the fact that the population of China was simply too great, even with 100 thousand Novice Villages it was pretty damn cramped. Right now the time is exactly 9:00 AM, practically all the players want to squeeze in at the first moment, one step first, each step first, this is commonly known knowledge. (TL: Basically, if you get ahead, it’s easier to continue maintaining a lead)</p>
<p>“Squeezing your uncle!! Do you believe that I’ll chop you into pieces!”</p>
<p>“I wipe (TL: fuck… don’t ask), which bastard stepped on my foot… *cough* *cough*, hey beauty, fate, fate I say! Wanna be friends!” (TL: Chinese netizens have a habit of replacing words with other words that sound the same. In this case the word for fate sounds similar to ape dung and that is what is placed.)</p>
<p>“You try pushing me one more time, I’m Wild Dog Gang’s third master’s big brother-in-law’s neighbors’s uncle Zhang’s son-in-law, do you not want to live anymore!”</p>
<p>“Stop squeezing, stop squeezing… AHHH, let me out, let me get out…”</p>
<p>“‘World’s Number One Hall’ recruiting people, as long as you join us ‘World’s Number One Hall’, money, women, equipment, you’ll have it all, also we will gift our master’s autographed picture, this chance cannot be missed, if missed it will not come again…”(TL: Chinese idiom)</p>
<p>All kinds of mixed up voices beside his ears made Ling Chen want to cover his ears, he took a deep breath in, pumping his legs, forcefully pushing through the crowd, jogging towards the village area.</p>
<p>Leaving the crowd, Ling Chen let out a small breath. The air here was a little too clean, breathing became a pleasant enjoyment. Looking forward, this village only had a few buildings, there were also only a few NPCs standing outside. Even though it was humble, but it didn’t give people a rundown feeling, contrarily giving a new feeling and being pleasant to look at.</p>
<p>Arriving at a considerably quiet corner, Ling Chen started to look at what he was wearing. Unsurprisingly, at the beginning of the game, everyone only has a body of rough, broken clothes. Upper body a rough cloth shirt, lower body rough cloth long pants, a pair of dry straw shoes on the feet.</p>
<p>[Novice Cloth Shirt] :Type: Upper Garment, Equipment Requirements: None, Grade: Pale White, Attributes: Defense+2.</p>
<p>[Novice Long Pants] :Type: Lower Garment, Equipment Requirements: None, Grade: Pale White, Attributes: Defense+2.</p>
<p>[Novice Straw Shoes] :Type: Shoe, Equipment Requirements: None, Grade: Pale White, Attributes: Defense+1</p>
<p>Okay then… added together the additional stats was only 5 points of defense.</p>
<p>Ling Chen then checked his backpack, at the beginning of the game, a players bag only has 50 storage spaces, at the moment inside quietly laid two pieces of equipment… a thin, long sword, a simple, unadorned bracelet.</p>
<p>[Novice Short Sword]:Type: Single Hand Sword, Equipment Requirements: None, Grade: Pale White, Attributes: Physical Attack+5</p>
<p>Having a novice weapon is pretty regular.</p>
<p>But… huh? A bracelet? 《Mystic Moon》 also generously gives this kind of accessory at the beginning of the game?</p>
<p>It needs to be known that, in almost all virtual reality games, rings, bracelets, earrings, necklaces these types of accessories have a very small drop rate, it’s value is obviously the greatest. Some players having a full set of good gear, but not a single accessory is a common scene. And a bracelet as a beginner equipment, this type of situation is the first time.</p>
<p>Ling Chen picked up the bracelet, from the feel of it, it can basically be determined as being made of regular metal. In the middle there are two pinky nail sized holes, looking around it, Ling Chen looked towards its stats:</p>
<p>[Metal Bracelet]:Type: Moon God Bracelet, Equipment Requirements: None, Grade: Pale White. The lowest grade Moon God Bracelet forged from iron, it can hold two medium-grade or lower energy crystals, cannot equip energy orbs, maximum slots: 2.</p>
<p>“Hm?” Looking through the description a couple times, Ling Chen was confused. Moon God Bracelet? What type of equipment is this. Why have I never heard of it before, is it a new type of equipment that appeared in these few years that I haven’t touched virtual reality games. Or is it 《Mystic Moon》’s exclusive equipment?</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes fell upon the two little holes, silently thinking, the slots mentioned in the description, does it mean slotting into these two small holes?</p>
<p>Examining it for a while, Ling Chen didn’t waste any more time, equipping the novice short sword and iron bracelet, he then looked towards his initials stats:</p>
<p>Character: Ling Tian</p>
<p>Level: 0</p>
<p>Class: Apprentice Warrior</p>
<p>Faction: None</p>
<p>Fame: 0; Money: 0</p>
<p>Basic Attributes: Strength: 10, Constitution: 5, Agility: 5, Spirit: 5</p>
<p>Innate Attributes: Luck: 5; Comprehension: 5</p>
<p>HP: 50</p>
<p>MP: 50</p>
<p>Physical Attack Strength: 25</p>
<p>Magic Attack Strength: 10</p>
<p>Physical Defense: 10</p>
<p>Hit Rate: 5; Dodge Rate: 5</p>
<p>Critical Hit Rate: 5%; Pierce Rate: 5% (TL: Ignore defense)</p>
<p>Attack Speed: 100%; Movement Speed: 100%</p>
<p>Elemental Resistance: Water: 0%; Fire: 0%; Wind: 0%; Lightning: 0%; Earth: 0%; Light: 0%; Darkness: 0%</p>
<p>Skills:</p>
<p>[Scan] :Current Level: LV1, cannot be upgraded. An ability for all classes, MP Consumption: 1, examine the basic stats of creatures no higher than yourself by 10 levels.</p>
<p>[Full Power Strike] : Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV5. Points to Upgrade to LV2: 1. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, using the weapon in the hand to strike at the target in front with all your strength, 110% damage, MP Consumption: 3, Cooldown Time: 1 sec.</p>
<p>The stats were regular, the free points for initial stats all went into strength, and so physical attack stat was a bit higher. There are only two skills, one is a global class scan ability, one is a beginner attack skill that is complete garbage… if it was just horrible damage then whatever, but it even had a 1 second cooldown! (TL: What? Cooldown times can get lower o.0)</p>
<p>Lifting his heading looking towards the area that he initially appeared in, it was already flooded with an even more exaggerated crowd of people</p>
<p>The majority of players that appeared looked for the village exit at the first moment, and then rushing towards the low-level novice farming grounds, evidently wanting their levels to be above everyone else’s.</p>
<p>“Guess I’ll take a look around the Novice Village first.” Ling Chen said under his breath, walking towards those couple of small, humble houses.</p>
<p>The old Village Chief stood in the middle of the village, dealing with one after another player. Ling Chen walked over, saying politely: “How do you do Chief, is there anything that I can help with?”</p>
<p>As virtual reality gaming technology reached its peak, etiquette towards the game world’s NPCs became general knowledge. The Novice Village Village Chief stroked his white beard, saying kindly: “Hello, warrior that comes from another world, may the Moon God protect you. Newly arriving in this world, your heart must be filled with confusion, then, please allow me to first explain to you some of this mysterious world’s basic knowledge.”</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have activated the quest ‘Village Chief’s Lesson’, the Chief will explain to you some of 《Mystic Moon》’s world’s basic knowledge. Quest Type: Normal, Quest Difficulty: None, Quest Time Limit: None, Quest Reward: Red Potion 5, 1 skill point, random beginner energy crystal 1. Do you accept?” (TL: Not sure if chance to receive one or of random type. Doesn’t matter since we all know what happens if it’s the first case.)</p>
<p>Is there even a need to think? Ling Chen directly chose “Accept”.</p>
<p>“Excellent.” The Chief nods his head satisfied, and then starts to explain: “Mystic Moon’s world is a vast and rich world, the main land shaped similarly to a crescent moon, the entire world is 20% land, 80% water. On land there are countless lifeforms along with infinite resources. At the moment the largest races on land are the human race and beast race. Humans are kind and simple, smart and hardworking, currently taking the leading position on land. The beast race is or gentle, or cruel, also, in mysterious places, there are also other special races. There is the god race established by the Moon God lineage, they control the balance of the entire Mystic Moon World, including the peace of the world, currently the leaders of the god race are the three goddesses Order, Freedom, and Fate. They possess power humans cannot even dream of. But they are not without enemies, that is the fiend race, always restless, fighting against the god race since ages past. In addition, there is also the demon race that is spread across the world’s corners, their action’s good and evil; The peace loving elves, with the most beautiful appearances; The undead race that exists within dark corners… Besides them, the world of Mystic Moon is for sure hiding other mysterious, unknown races, all of this, requires you people to personally find and discover.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Sigh… another nice long introduction.</p>
<p>Legend goes, the Moon God clan has existed since the spread of humanity, with protecting the Mystic Moon world as their mission. Every main land in Mystic Moon, will each have a patron saint from the god race, they are known as Moon Saints. All are female, having immense power. Although, unless the mainland suffers a catastrophic disaster, or approaches a moment of life and death, the god clan’s 3 goddesses will not act. Towards the conflict between same and different races, they too do not interfere. The place we are at right now is a land outside the the central main land, it is one of the countless islands spread across the endless sea. We the people who live here are unable to leave, and when you leave here, you will also be unable to ever return. Come find me when your level reaches 10. I will send you to a continent named ‘Forgotten’ (Yi Wang). The patron moon saint there is named ‘Forgotten Goddess’, if you are lucky enough, maybe you’ll be able to see her one day.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“This is the basic background of Mystic Moon, if you want to know more, you will need to look for it yourself. Please allow me to describe to you some necessary knowledge for adventuring. Then , let’s start from the basic attributes first. Strength, constitution, agility, spirit are the four basic stats along with luck and comprehension these two innate attributes. I believe that the girl’s from the fairy race have already given you detailed explanations, those are the most basic ability names, I don’t think I need to explain more. Allow me to first explain to you the rules of damage colours that appear in battle.</p>
<p>Damaging the target, or when being damaged, normally a red damage number will appear. If a critical strike is activated, it will deal double damage, the color of the damage that appears will be yellow. If a pierce attack is activated, then, the damage you do will ignore defense, the damage that appears will be blue. Against high defense targets, the effect of the pierce strike is quite impressive. If both critical and pierce is activated, then, purple damage will appear… Critical pierce strike, at a lot of times will be a miracle strike that can turn around an unfavourable situation. In addition, there is also a very rare black coloured damage, that only appears when the insta-kill effect activates. Although, a cheat attribute like insta-kill besides undead creature, pretty much won’t appear.</p>
<p>(TL: Guh, I hate this)</p>
<p>“Elemental resistance, is regarding the ability to resist the associated element. The resistance number represents the ratio that the associated element is reduced by, for example when resistance is 50%, damage can be reduced by 50%, when resistance is 100%, then you can be immune to this type of element, although such a situation is almost impossible for a human. If resistance surpasses 100%, for example reaching 125%, then, the associated element will not only not cause harm, on the other hand it will absorb the 25% damage and transfer it to health. Also, if your personal element is suppressed by another element, that there is a chance for a negative resistance to appear for a certain element. For instance, if resistance towards the fire element is -50%, then when suffering from a fire based attack damage received will be 150%, if it’s -100%, then damage received will be 200%. Using the element that suppresses to attack the target will obtain an effect of double the result for half the work.” (TL: Chinese idiom)</p>
<p>The Village Chief slightly paused for a pit, taking a few breaths, continuing to say: “In regards to attributes, is there anything else that you don’t understand?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen though for a bit, shaking his head, and then raising his right hand: “Chief, what kind of equipment is this Moon God Bracelet?” (TL: Goddammit what is there to think about!. Do you not math! Sigh)</p>
<p>The village Chief smiled warmly: “This is just was I was about to explain to you. The Moon God Bracelet was invented by the Moon God clan a long time ago, it can bestow upon human’s additional strength. The Moon God Bracelet itself has no attributes, but can be slotted with energy crystals or energy orbs, and take the power from the crystal or orb bestowing it upon the wearer. See, your iron bracelet here has two holes, those are used to slot in energy crystals or energy orbs. According to the strength of the energy crystal, they can be split into 5 grades; beginner, elementary, intermediate, advanced, and ultimate. Because the ability of this Moon God Bracelet is too low, at most it can only be slotted with intermediate power crystals, and at most only two. In the future in your adventures, you will for sure be able to see some high-grade Moon God Bracelets that can be slotted with more and higher-grade energy crystals or even energy orbs. They say, on Forgotten continent there once appeared a Moon God Bracelet that had 7 slots, although, sigh, I don’t have the fortune of seeing such a legendary item in my lifetime.”</p>
<p>“What are energy orbs?” Ling Chen interrupted.</p>
<p>“The nature of energy orbs are the same as energy crystals, but they are also an existence that surpasses energy crystals. They are not like energy crystals that are simply broken pieces, but are a complete body. The grades for energy orbs from low to high are Fairy Orbs, Heaven End Orbs, Mysterious God Orbs and the Saint Destroyer Orbs that only exist in long ago legends. Energy orbs are incredibly valuable, if a normal person is able to obtain one, then it is something that is enough to be proud of for the rest of their life. Although, even if an energy orb is obtained, it can not be freely used, because only fairy grade or above Moon God Bracelets, have the qualifications to slot them. Speaking of the rule of grades, Mystic Moon world’s equipment, including Moon God Bracelets from low-grade to high are separated as: Pale White, Iron, Copper, Silver, Gold, Fairy (仙灵）, Heaven End (天绝), Mysterious God (神玄), Saint Destroyer (圣灭). The stronger the the equipment, the more difficult for it to appear. Heaven End and Mysterious God equipment even looking at the entire Mystic Moon world are very rare, as for Saint Destroyer equipment, those are thing’s that only exist in legends. Maybe, only the god race or fiend race could have any.</p>
<p>The Chief’s voice paused for a moment, and then continued saying: “Then, let me teach you how to use the Moon God Bracelet. Right now, I will give you a beginner energy crystal, what you need to do, is slot it into the Moon God Bracelet in your hand.”</p>
<p>After the Chief’s voice, a prompt sound rang beside his ear: “*DING*… You have gained a randomly attributed energy crystal from the Village Chief of Novice Village number 49554, please slot it into your Moon God Bracelet.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen opened his bag, inside was added a small exquisite red crystal. Picking up the crystal, Ling Chen felt puzzled… this crystal as big as a thumb, how could it slot into the small hole on the Moon God Bracelet.</p>
<p>[Beginner Critical Crystal]: Type: Energy Crystal, Grade: Beginner, Attribute: Fire, Effect: Critical Rate+2%</p>
<p>“Hehe, looks like your luck is pretty good, getting the energy crystal that can boost crit. rate. Then, slot it into the Moon God Bracelet, you only need to bring it close to the Moon God Bracelet.” The Chief said laughingly.</p>
<p>Increasing crit. rate by 2%, it is a pretty good attribute. The most elementary power crystals already had such an effect, then higher-grades… and then orbs that are even more powerful than crystals…</p>
<p>Ling Chen picked up the fire red crystal, slowly bringing it to the hole on the iron bracelet, on contact, a beam of red light flashed by, a system prompt “Slotting Successful” ringing by his ears. The power stone in his hand disappeared, the iron bracelet that initially had two empty holes, one of them was now filled by a red crystal.</p>
<p>Opening his stat page, his crit. rate had suddenly become 7%.</p>
<p>“You’ve done very well, elementary energy crystals and Moon God Bracelets can be bought in the corresponding stores, but high-grade energy crystals and Moon God Bracelets, along with energy orbs can only be obtained through other means, such as killing powerful monsters. . I believe in your future adventures you will find stronger Moon God Bracelets and energy crystals, maybe you’ll even be able to obtain very valuable energy orbs. Also, you need to remember, the same Moon God Bracelet cannot be slotted with two of the same energy crystal or energy orb with the same effect. For instance, your Moon God Bracelet already has an energy crystal that increases crit. rate, which means, no matter how many free slots your Moon God Bracelet has, you can no longer add any energy crystals or orbs that increase crit. rate.</p>
<p>“You should now understand how to use the Moon God Bracelet, now let me explain to you the rules for skills.” The Chief proceeded to say, “The basic rules for skills you must already know, what I’m going to explain is only the rules for skill upgrading and advancing. The greatest advantage of humans, is their high intelligence and great hidden potential, as long as you have enough potential, you can make the same skill exhibit an even stronger power. Right now you are an apprentice warrior, then, you must have a beginner skill ‘Full Power Strike”, its level is LV1, but you only need one skill point, it can then be upgraded to LV2, possessing an even stronger power. Right now, I will use the power bestowed upon me by the Moon God to give you a skill point, please put it into ‘Full Power Strike’.”</p>
<p>Finishing his speech, the Chief waved his hands, immediately, a white light fell from the sky, falling upon Ling Chen, gone in a flash.</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have gained 1 skill point, please put it into ‘Full Power Strike’.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen saw, an additional attribute had appeared on his stat page: SP: 1.</p>
<p>Without wasting time, Ling Chen put this skill point that he just got into his only upgrade-able skill “Full Power Strike”, right away, a white light flashed on his body.</p>
<p>“*DING*… Your skill ‘Full Power Strike’ has successfully upgraded to LV2.”</p>
<p>[Full Power Strike]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level: LV5. Points to Upgrade to LV3: 5. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, using the weapon in the hand to strike at the target in front with all your strength, 120% damage, MP Consumption: 4, Cooldown Time: 0 sec.</p>
<p>After Full Power Strike’s upgrade, it’s damage was increased to 120%, even the cooldown decreased to 0. Only the MP consumption increased by that 1 point, one upgrade, who knew that it could have such a huge improvement!</p>
<p>Few… I think we finally get to see some action now. Feel free to suggest some better names for the item grades or if you want them in chinese pronunciation. Next time on Dragon Ball Z Shura’s Wrath, beating up rabbits.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“A problem is not a problem if it’s not seen as one” – Hikigaya Hachiman</p>
<p>“Good, your skill has been successfully upgraded. If you have enough SP, you can upgrade it to even higher levels. When a skill reaches its highest level, if you have enough comprehension, there is a big chance that you can grasp an even stronger ‘advance skill’. Although, it is very hard to gain SP, regardless of leveling-up, killing normal monsters, it is not possible to gain SP. It can only be gained through some special quests, and killing strong monsters. Monsters from weak to strong can be split as, 1 star elites, 2 star elites, 3 star elites, going higher, are powerful lord monsters, above lords, are the very rare, fairy, heaven end, mysterious god and saint destroyer monster’s that are almost impossible for humans to defeat. Killing a 1 star elite monster by yourself, you will gain SP equivalent to its level. For example, killing a LV1 1 star elite monster, you will gain 1 SP, killing a LV3 , you will gain 3 SP. Independently killing a 2 star elite, you will earn SP equal to its LVx2, killing a 3 star elite, you will gain SP that of its LVx3. Killing a Lord BOSS, you will gain its LVx10 SP. If able to kill a fairy creature, you will gain its LVx100 SP, killing a heaven end monster, its LVx1000 SP will be gained, and so on… If a group works together to defeat a monster, then the group will be evenly distributed the SP.</p>
<p>Babbling a lot, he finally finished explaining the skill upgrade system. At the beginning of the game, the majority of players all want to quickly gain levels and pull apart the level gap, leading in front of other players, not a lot of people will have the patience to finish listening to the Village Chief’s super long novice lesson.</p>
<p>But Ling Chen sat there quietly listening, not missing a word. SP can only be gained by killing elite and above monsters, this is indeed overly harsh. At the same time, it will also result in a consequence… elite and BOSS monsters that were already being fought over, in《Mystic Moon》 will be fought over even more fiercely. High grade monsters means high grade equipment, and more important than equipment, are skills! It can be foreseen, area’s that can easily spawn high-grade BOSS monsters will definitely be fought over to the death.</p>
<p>The Chief rested his throat, only then saying: “Young man, it is rare for you to quietly listen to me say so much, young one’s with patience like you are already very good, come, take this, these should be able to help you in your adventures.”</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have successfully completed the quest ‘Village Chief’s Lesson’, the rewards of an energy crystal and SP have already been administered, gained red medicine 5. Because you completely listened to the Village Chief’s words, extra reward ‘Scan Scroll’ 1.”</p>
<p>Huh? There’s also extra rewards?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, patiently listening to the novice lesson had an extra reward… and it’s even a scroll! It needs to be known, scrolls this type of thing have a drop rate of who knows how many time lower than equipment. Ling Chen felt as though we was seeing a large pie slowly drop from the sky. (TL: Chinese idiom. “Pie falling from the sky”, means something good happening out of nowhere)</p>
<p>Opening his bag, sure enough there were 2 extra things.</p>
<p>[Red Potion]: The lowest grade HP recovery potion, heals 100 HP after use, Cooldown Time: 5 sec.</p>
<p>[Scan Scroll]: A scroll with the ability to scan, after use, detailed information for monsters no higher than your level by 30 can be gained.</p>
<p>So it’s a scroll to scan the information of monsters. Ling Chen took back his focus, politely saying to the Chief: “Thank you Chief, is there anything else I can help with?”</p>
<p>“There is.” The Chief nods his head, and then says in melancholy: “Recently, a group of strange rabbits have appeared around the periphery of the village, they have sharp teeth, regularly attacking people, can you help me exterminate that group of rabbits, and bring back their teeth?|</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have activated the quest ‘Village Chief’s Request 1’, Quest Description: Collect 10 teeth from buck-toothed-rabbits and give them to the Village Chief, Quest Type: Normal, Quest Time Limit: None. Quest Reward: 100 EXP, 1 silver. Do you accept?”</p>
<p>“Accept.” Ling Chen directly accepted.</p>
<p>The Chief nods his head satisfactorily: “Then, I will wait here for your good news. Oh right, before that, you best check out the general store and smithy, the item store’s Old Wang and the smithy’s Old Tie should have some stuff that requires your help. Oh right, there’s one thing you need to pay attention to, that house, do not get close.”</p>
<p>The Chief extended his hand, pointing behind him. Following the Chief’s finger, Ling Chen saw a rundown small, straw house, that straw house was in the most obscure spot, and it was also the dirtiest house. Ling Chen took back his gaze, revealing a quizzical look.</p>
<p>“Inside lives a scary lunatic. From the day we saw him, he was in that abnormal state. Although it’s good that he usually just hides in the house not willing to leave. If at whatever moment you see him come out, you must not get close to him.” The Chief said with a serious face.</p>
<p>“Okay, thank you Chief.”</p>
<p>Parting from the Village Chief, Ling Chen jogged along the way, coming to the centre of the village, walking into the item store. He first flipped through the items being sold here:</p>
<p>[Red Potion]: … Price: 1 copper</p>
<p>[Orange Potion]: Low-grade HP recovery potion, heals 200 HP after use, Cooldown Time: 5 sec. Price: 3 copper</p>
<p>[Yellow Potion]: Low-grade HP recovery potion, heals 400 HP after use, Cooldown Time: 5 sec. Price: 1 silver.</p>
<p>[Blue Potion]: Low-grade MP recovery potion, heals 100 HP after use, Cooldown Time: 5 sec. Price: 2 copper</p>
<p>In Mystic Moon’s world, 1 gold = 10 silver = 100 copper, these recovery potions along with their increasing recovery ability, their prices also show a considerable jump. And these, are just what player’s at the moment can barely buy, below, are a bunch of items that normal payers can’t afford to buy…</p>
<p>[Beginner Strength Stone]; Type: Energy Crystal, Grade: Beginner, Attribute: Fire, Effect: Physical Attack Strength+3%. Price: 20 gold.</p>
<p>[Beginner Magic Stone]; Type: Energy Crystal, Grade: Beginner, Attribute: Water, Effect: Magic Attack Strength+3%. Price: 20 gold.</p>
<p>[Beginner Health Stone]; Type: Energy Crystal, Grade: Beginner, Attribute: Water, Effect: HP+3%. Price: 20 gold.</p>
<p>[Beginner Dodge Stone]: …</p>
<p>[Beginner Pierce Stone]: …</p>
<p>As the Chief said, the general store sold some low-grade energy crystals, but the most beginner crystals were already sold at 20 gold. 20 gold,for player’s at the beginning of the game was an astronomical number. The most beginner crystals were already sold at such a price, what kind of astronomical price would higher-grade crystals be sold at.</p>
<p>Calming down, Ling Chen said towards the yawning shopkeeper: “Hello Boss Wang, is there anything I can help you with?”</p>
<p>“Oh, hello, hero from another world.” The item store shopkeeper responded a bit unconcerned: “I do have something that requires your help. Just a few days ago, when I went to Shrub Forest to gather herbs, I encountered an attack by a group of wild boar. Running away in haste, I lost a very important ring. Sigh, I don’t expect to get the ring back, but my anger towards those boars cannot be extinguished, hero from another world, can you help me exterminate 30 wild boars, relieving the hate in my heart?”</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have activated the quest “Wang Ji’s Request’, Quest Description: “Exterminate 30 wild boars, Quest Type: Normal, Quest Time Limit: None. Quest Reward: 500EXP, 2 silver, orange potions 10, blue potions 10, do you accept?”</p>
<p>“Accept.”</p>
<p>“Excellent… although, forest wild boars are LV5 monsters, with your current ability you are still unable to threaten them, properly increase your strength first, I await your good news.” Shopkeeper Wang lazily closed his eyes after finishing.</p>
<p>Walking out of the item store, Ling Chen came to the smithy. First quickly sweeping through the equipment sold, and then saying to the old blacksmith who was working hard smithing: “Hello Boss Tie, is there anything I can help you with?”</p>
<p>The old blacksmith stopped his work, wiping the sweat on his face, saying smilingly: “Hello, hero from another world, I do have something I need your help with. Recently I’ve pretty much used up my casting materials, can you help bring me 100 wolf teeth? Wolf teeth are sharp and durable, mixing it into the iron can create a sharp weapon.”</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have activated the quest ‘Blacksmith’s Request’, Quest Description: Bring back 100 wolf teeth and give them to the smithy’s Old Tie. Quest Type: Normal, Quest Time Limit: None. Quest Reward: 1000EXP, 3 silver, 1 LV5 iron short-sword, do you accept?”</p>
<p>“Accept.”</p>
<p>“Wolves are at the Wolf’s Cliff at the north of the village, the bottom of Wolf’s Cliff is a bottomless chasm, that is a very dangerous place, when you reach there make sure to stay away from the cliff’s edge, do not fall down. Also, wolves are LV5 creatures, with your current ability you are unable to threaten them, properly raise your strength, I await your good news.” Finishing talking, the old blacksmith turned around, continuing his work. (TL: These are some pretty damn generic NPCs.)</p>
<p>Waling around the Novice Village, receiving only the 3 quests, 2 of which it is required to fight LV5 creatures, clearly not something regular players can do at the moment. Ling Chen walked around the village a bit longer, besides the straw house the Chief warned not to get close to, walking around the entire village, only then carrying his novice sword and charging to the wilderness.</p>
<p>Leaving the village, what’s there is a vast field. Taking a look, his vision filled with thickly dotted groups of people, occasionally seeing some rabbits appear in these groups, but immediately being swarmed by players, instantly exterminating them leaving behind just a few rabbit hairs. (TL: ZERG FEST!)</p>
<p>Beside Ling Chen, a white rabbit spawned, and then started to rock back and forth examining this world.</p>
<p>[Buck-Toothed-Rabbit]: Type: Beast. Level: 1, HP: 50. A type of rabbit with big, pointy teeth. when in an emergency rabbits will also bite people, if bit it will really hurt ne. (TL: There is a chinese idiom that goes something like “Anxious dog jumps the wall” saying that when pushed up against a wall, people will do extreme things. The rabbit biting thing is a play on that.)</p>
<p>Under the scan skill, Ling Chen gained this buck-toothed-rabbit’s basic data, right when he was about to raise his sword, a massive swarm of arrows and magic bullets all smashed into the poor little rabbit, instantly, all that was left in front of Ling Chen was a pile of rabbit fur.</p>
<p>Okay, so now is where everything starts.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Food tastes best when you don’t have to work for it.” – Hikigaya Hachiman.</p>
<p>I hope you guys enjoy this chapter as much as I hated translating it.</p>
<p>“Okay then…” Ling Chen helplessly twitched his lips, not stopping, walking further into the map. Right at that time, not far to his right, a buck-toothed-rabbit that was clearly bigger than a regular rabbit appeared in a flash of white light, carrying a giant carrot on its shoulder.</p>
<p>The noisy crowd of people immediately exploded.</p>
<p>“Elite!! It’s a 1 star elite monster!!”</p>
<p>“Holy crap! It’s an elite monster! An elite monster that can add SP!!”</p>
<p>The player’s around the area acted as though they were injected with chicken blood all rushing towards the elite buck-toothed-rabbit. The poor elite rabbit was drowned in the blink of an eye, and then the next second… without the chance to even swing his big carrot, became a bunch of rabbit fur like the other regular rabbits… even giving a half-eaten carrot on the side.</p>
<p>“I got it, I got it!!” A player that was determined to have killed the elite rabbit and gaining 1 SP, danced around crying out, excited as if he’d won the 5 million jackpot.</p>
<p>“Fuck! Why’re you so goddamn arrogant… Go, burst him!!” (TL: In terms of the bursting, it’s a term used in games to say kill them and also a slang term for attack/kill. They also say stuff like “Burst his equipment” meaning killing them and making them drop their equipment on death. Not sure how I’ll translate this in the future. Suggestions welcome.)</p>
<p>The red-eyed players swarmed forward, after a scream the player who only showed-off for 5 seconds fell to the ground, turning into a beam of white light returning to the Novice Village.</p>
<p>Seeing this massive group, Ling Chen didn’t know when he would be able to complete the quest of collecting rabbit teeth. Not stopping anymore, he walked further in.</p>
<p>After the buck-toothed-rabbit’s territory, is the territory of the LV2 monster black horned sheep. This place was also packed full with players. After that, is the territory of the LV3 creature civet cat. The numbers of players here noticeably decreased a lot. Leveling in 《Mystic Moon》 is relatively hard, even from LV0 to LV1, it can’t be done without a hour or so. Ling Chen stopped, looking towards the civet cat’s stats:</p>
<p>Angry Civet Cat: Type: Beast, Level: 3, HP: 100. Civet cats get angry too, you need to be careful of being bitten or clawed by it.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>The player’s that come here are all because they have no choice, after all the amount of people at the black horned sheep and buck-toothed-rabbits was simply too great. All the players here moved in groups, besides Ling Chen, almost nobody was soloing.</p>
<p>Lifting his sword, Ling Chen faced the closest civet cat and stabbed towards it, after an overly strong wind, the civet cat was hit.</p>
<p>-18.</p>
<p>Being attacked the civet cat became furious, charging towards Ling Chen while making weird noises, using its pointy front claw to claw at him. Ling Chen’s body slightly moved back, the civet’s cat’s attack missing, a fierce sword wind once again attacking it…</p>
<p>“Full Powered Strike!”</p>
<p>-23.</p>
<p>Ling Chen landed his only attack skill, pushing the civet cat back a small step. The civet cat immediately charged forward fiercely, waving its claws lunging towards him. Ling Chen easily dodged, another sword blow landing on the civet cat, making its body that was still in mid-jump crash into the ground. He then took a step forward, a series of sword strikes landing on the currently unable to move civet cat’s body.</p>
<p>-19, -20, MISS, -19, MISS, -18. (TL: Wow, hit rate really isn’t a joke here.)</p>
<p>The civet cat’s tail finally curved upwards, not moving anymore. a copper coin falling from its body, landing at Ling Chen’s feet.</p>
<p>Picking up the copper coin, looking at his own experience bar that grew a bit, Ling Chen walked to the next civet cat, the simple, unadorned novice sword stabbing forward. 7 attacks, plus 7 transitions done in the blink of an eye, the second civet cat fell.</p>
<p>They were all swinging their swords attacking creatures, but like how regular players were also doing the same thing, under comparison you would find, Ling Chen’s movement’s were unusually rapid, the sword in his hand only lightly shook, an afterimage flashing by, the novice sword already landing on the target’s body. As fast as a streak of lightning flashing by. At the same time, his movement of retracting the sword was also incredibly fast. When the sword touches the target, before the damage number can even float upwards, the sword is already quickly withdrawn. Ling Chen’s body also followed the sword moving vertically or horizontally, and every time at the moment he retracts his sword and changes position he would always perfectly dodge the civet cat’s upcoming attack, as if already knowing where the opponent was about to attack. Under his attacks that were like flowing water, in only just a couple of minutes, his sides were already lying a small group of civet cat bodies. (TL: I did a horrible job of translating this. I would really appreciate if someone would try and make a better translation.)</p>
<p>“Huu (TL: breath out)… No challenge at all.” Curling his lips, Ling Chen said to himself. Tilting his head, he saw 3 people staring at him with their eyes popping out… Accurately saying, they were staring at the small pile of civet cat bodies by his feet. Almost not willing to believe that they were all killed by him alone. It needs to be known, unless you stepped on some kind of massive dog shit luck, right now the entire world’s players should all be at LV0. Coming here at LV1 to solo farm was still acceptable, but one person, exterminating so many within such a short period of time, how could they not be surprised. (TL: Dog shit, chinese equivalent of bullshit, no racism please)</p>
<p>What made them even more surprised, is the process that they saw the civet cats killed… A creature that them 3 working together still had to be careful facing, under his hands were killed easily like he was doing tricks. They practically couldn’t see him swinging his sword, the speed that he moved his body made them cross-eyed — And, that displacement did not depend on the movement speed from transitioning, but his feet following his body and moving at the same time. All players have the same initial movement speed of 100, but they, could definitely not shift their position like Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Glancing at them, Ling Chen didn’t say anything, picking up the copper on the ground, putting away his sword, walking deeper into the map, leaving behind those three people staring at each other. The civet cats here are 2 levels higher than him, but to him there really wasn’t any challenge. Not to mention, the Novice Village didn’t have a place that sold masks, at the moment he can’t draw attention to himself. He wasn’t really afraid of anything, but he will not allow any possibility of Ling Shui Ruo’s peaceful life being disturbed.</p>
<p>“That movement, that displacement, that awareness, and the gaze that he looked at us with… Definitely an expert!!”</p>
<p>“Wrong! An expert among experts!”</p>
<p>“What do you guys say, could he be someone on the China master list?”</p>
<p>Looking in the direction that Ling Chen left, the 3 people carefully discussed.</p>
<p>After the civet cat is the LV4 fox, the number of players here was already pitifully little, only able to see some sparsely spread people. Not stopping, Ling Chen continued walking forward, continuing to walk out of the field, arriving at a shrub forest.</p>
<p>The shrub forest was a bit dim, more or less exuding a dangerous aura. Here, Ling Chen could no longer see a single person. Ling Chen walked around inside, suddenly stopping, the shrub on his right shaking, suddenly bursting apart, two wild beasts carrying an air of ferocity charging forward, long boar tusks like two sharp knives.</p>
<p>[Mountain Wild Boars]: Type: Beast, Level: 5, HP: 180,. A type of wild boar that is used to living in the mountains, a violent temperament. It will automatically attack life forms that get close.</p>
<p>A player that is only LV1, a full set of novice equipment challenging a LV5 monster, in the eyes of any player this was an act of suicide. Not to mention, what Ling Chen is facing is the simultaneous attack of two LV5 wild boars.</p>
<p>Mountain wild boars… the exact creature that the item shop’s Mr. Wang want’s him to hunt.</p>
<p>The wild boars running speed is very quick, from far away Ling Chen could still feel a gust of wind rushing at him. He did not retreat, instead slightly squinting his eyes, quietly watching the 2 wild boars approach.</p>
<p>Whoosh!!</p>
<p>Right when the wild boar’s sharp tusks were only centimeters away from his chest, he suddenly turned his body at an alarming speed. This was not a simple body turn, because if anyone saw the speed that he turned his body, they would all be dumbstruck. incredibly surprised at his almost unbelievable explosive power.</p>
<p>The sharp tusk practically stuck to him as it slid past, it was also at that moment, Ling Chen raised his hand following the momentum, a “Full Power Strike” stabbing at its back.</p>
<p>-8!</p>
<p>The wild boar’s defense wasn’t too exaggerated, at the very least Ling Chen’s LV0 initial stats were enough to rip open its defense. At this moment, the second wild beast also charged to his front. Ling Chen did not retract his sword that he swung, instead his body following the sword moving forward, dodging the wild boar as if a coincident.</p>
<p>The faster you run, the longer it takes to stop. Ling Chen charged directly behind the first wild boar, 3 consecutive “Full Power Strike”s cutting into its back.</p>
<p>-9, MISS, MISS.</p>
<p>With only 5 hit rate, adding the level suppression, Ling Chen’s attacks were mostly “MISS”. He didn’t care, evidently understanding earlier that it would be like this.</p>
<p>The two wild boars that missed finally returned to their senses. This time, they did not charge one forward one backward, but instead one to the right and one to the left, 8 short legs carrying the dust on the ground upwards. Ling Chen’s took a small step backwards, and then suddenly stopped. Instead facing towards the sharp tusks of the boars and charging forward…</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body like a ghostly shadow crossed through the small gap between the two boars, simultaneously cutting the first boar, a damage of “-7” appearing. He then quickly turned around, another 3 continuous blows stabbing in the wild boar, causing a series of cries from the boar.</p>
<p>MISS, MISS, -7.</p>
<p>The two wild boars became furious, one of them after turning around, once landing on the ground, actually jumped up half-a-meter high, pouncing towards Ling Chen’s body. Ling Chen was speechless, casually taking a step back, immediately, in front of him a “thump” sound, the wild board had fallen on the ground, 4 short legs sticking to the ground, not coming up after a while.</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t hesitate and went forward with a series of attacks, saying while attacking: “If you can’t jump then don’t jump, you’re a boar, not a panther, do you understand self-awareness?”</p>
<p>Suffering from a dozen or so of Ling Chen’s attacks, even if the majority were MISS, but the first wild boar’s HP still dropped around one quarter. Finally getting off the ground, it gave a loud cry, charging at Ling Chen at full force, wanting to smash him into the sky.</p>
<p>Naturally its charge didn’t even scratch Ling Chen’s clothes.</p>
<p>If there were other players here right now, they would definitely be surprised to the point of speechlessness. Two wild boars whose movements were relatively nimble, their charge fast and fierce, normal player’s couldn’t even think of dodging it. Yet, Ling Chen’s body was leisurely moving between the two beasts, from beginning to end not being touched by the wild boars. And his novice sword always in that short time-frame of dodging able to stab or cut accurately on the wild boar’s body. Slowly taking away their lives, causing them to cry out.</p>
<p>3 minutes later, under a dozen or so of Ling Chen’s pinpoint attacks, the first wild boar finally fell to the ground in a cry of anguish, dropping 2 copper coins and a red potion. With only one wild boar left the remaining job was even easier. Ling Chen changed from being passive to taking the initiative, directly facing it, easily dodging its attacks, the bland novice sword attacking it from all directions. In not even 2 minutes, the second wild boar also fell on the ground.</p>
<p>In 5 minutes time, as LV0, using a full set of novice equipment to kill two LV5 monsters, saying it out people would find it hard to believe… Even scarier, this person was unscathed from beginning to end!</p>
<p>Son of a… I absolutely hated translating this chapter. I probably could have translated two chapters with the time it took me to translate this one. I have lost all confidence in myself. BTW, just ignore me. Though from how hard it was for me to translate this chapter, I’m most likely not going to translate any novel that’s martial arts heavy.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Even if a LV0 player constantly attacked a not-moving LV5 monster it would still take them half a day. Killing higher level creatures as a novice, not only is it inefficient, it’s also very easy to get insta-killed. Player’s with the balls like Ling Chen to run around the territory of the wild boars at LV0… at least in the whole of Novice Village 49554 there was just Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Ling Chen decided to stay here, actively searching for wild boars. One reason is to complete the quest, more so because this place was quiet enough, nobody would bother him.</p>
<p>One hour later, under his LV0 state, and the cuts and strikes from the novice sword, the 30th wild boar fell in front of him. At the same time, a white halo floated up from Ling Chen’s head…</p>
<p>“Congratulations! You have leveled up, now LV1, HP+10, MP+10, gained 5 AP.”</p>
<p>Finally raised a level, Ling Chen let out a small breath… Killing 30 LV5 creatures but only rising from LV0 to LV1, completing his first step in this world, how bullshit is the leveling system for 《Mystic Moon》.</p>
<p>Even more bullshit, he’s already killed 3o higher level wild boars, but in total they only dropped a couple dozen copper coins and a few red potions, not even a white grade equipment.</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have successfully killed 30 mountain wild boars, completing the quest requirements for ‘Wang Ji’s Request’, you can now return to the Novice Village’s item store and hand in your quest.”</p>
<p>Completing a quest at the same time as leveling up, but Ling Chen did not leave right away, instead staying here, continuing to look for the next wild boar. The reward for the wild boar quest is a pile of potions. these he didn’t really need at the moment. What he needs most, is to quickly raise his level.</p>
<p>-17, MISS, MISS, -18…</p>
<p>Putting all of his stat points into strength without even hesitating, the damage that Ling Chen dealt towards the wild boars doubled. His health currently at a brittle 60 points. If he suffered hits from multiple boars he will directly die and return to the Novice Village. Players that dare to chase after extreme attack at the beginning… pretty much nobody would besides those who’s brains had a little problem. No matter how strong your attack… if you can’t even take two of the monster’s attacks then it can only be a decoration. It needs to be known, warriors are a close combat profession, they are very different from kiting archers and elemental mages. They need to develop their attack, defense and health.</p>
<p>His damage doubling against the wild boars, adding his level up, the level suppression on hit rate was slightly weakened. Ling Chen’s rate of exterminating wild boars also doubled, after another hour, the 100th wild boar fell before him, his experience points already reaching 70% of LV1.</p>
<p>Following the death of the 100th wild boar, a dim, dark grey colored piece of equipment fell by its side.</p>
<p>Ling Chen took a step forward, picking it up.</p>
<p>[Fine Cloth Long Pants]: Type: Lower Garment, Grade: Pale White, Equipment Requirement: Any class LV5 or above, long pants made from intricate cloth, more or less has some defensive abilities, Attributes: Defense+5.</p>
<p>2 hours, killing 100 wild boars higher level than him, finally dropping a piece of equipment… a pair of white grade long pants that can only be worn at LV5.</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t know if he was supposed to cry or laugh.</p>
<p>“Is it that my initial luck stat is too low?” Ling Chen stared at his “5” luck, silently thinking.</p>
<p>Looking at the time, it was already nearing noon. Ling Chen didn’t continue looking for wild boars, instead closing his eye, issuing the “Exit Game” command.</p>
<p>A flash of light, Ling Chen had already disappeared from the Mystic Moon world.</p>
<p>Opening his eyes, Ling Chen saw the crystal chandelier on his ceiling, along with two eyes even more pure and beautiful than crystals.</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo sat by his side, her hands at her cheeks, a slight smile at the corners of her lips, staring at him without blinking, staring at him for who knows how long. Seeing him open his eyes, Shui Ruo smiled sweetly: “Brother, you’re awake.”</p>
<p>Even though he was already very familiar with Shui Ruo, but he still became dazed looking at her face up close.</p>
<p>He would constantly praise if it was that the heavens spent all of its energy on sculpting Shui Ruo’s face and body, or else, why were his Shui Ruo’s face and body so perfect to the point of appearing as though an illusion.</p>
<p>Ling Chen sat up on the couch, saying with care and blame: “Ruo Ruo, why are you not listening again and moving around on your own, what you need the most right now is rest.”</p>
<p>“But I really like seeing brother’s peaceful look.” Shui Ruo stuck out her pink tongue, smiling saying: “Brother, did you have fun in the game?”</p>
<p>“Ya!” Ling Chen carried Ling Shui Ruo from the wheelchair, placing her where he was just lying, putting his hand on her cheek: “Are you hungry, what do you want to eat for lunch?”</p>
<p>“Um, I want to drink mushroom soup… Brother, can you play the piano for me first?” Ling Shui Ruo blinked her eyes, desire and joy flashing in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Ling Chen nodded smiling, placing down Shui Ruo body, and then walking towards the piano in the corner of the living room.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the piano, slender fingers touching the piano keys, following the rise of the first note, his fingers start to move along the piano keys as if dancing, a piano sound as gentle as a breeze and nourishing as dew entered Shui Ruo’s heart. In the warm and soothing sound of the piano, Ling Shuo Ruo gently closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo would never forget, brother’s piano skills, were hand-by-hand taught by her. He learned things so quickly, using only a few months, the piano sound that he played made her, and her parents intoxicated, making her who learned the piano since she was little candidly admit defeat. After, she caught Isrock, her parents left, at her most hopeless moment, it was him, using the warmest piano sounds allowing her to slowly break away from that pale world…</p>
<p>The piano sound lingering, Ling Chen heard Shui Ruo’s even breathing. He stood up from the piano, returning to the bedroom, taking out a soft blanket, lightly placing it on the smiling Shui Ruo who was already asleep, lightly kissing her face, and then walking lightly towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>The kitchen’s door was tightly closed, to prevent waking up Shui Ruo. And Shui Ruo at this time also slightly opened her eyes. Before she and her parents caught Isrock , Ling Chen didn’t know anything in regards to, cooking, cleaning these kinds of household chores. But shortly after that, for her, he learned everything that he didn’t know before, striving to make himself do it the best… And from the beginning, continuing until now.</p>
<p>Maybe, I am a pitiful girl, because I’ve been infected with the most terrifying Isrock. But, more times, I feel like I am enough to be envied and admired by all of the world’s other girls… because, I have the best brother.</p>
<p>Afternoon, accompanying Shui Ruo until she peacefully fell asleep. Ling Chen once again entered 《Mystic Moon》, appearing in the place he went offline in the morning.</p>
<p>Just going online, his communication device rang.</p>
<p>The player communication device is an intricate bracelet on the wrist, not only does it have communication capabilities, it also displays time, and can take pictures or videos. When you don’t want to use it you can also throw it into your bag, this way nobody can contact you.</p>
<p>The person that called him is called “Huan Mie”, Ling Chen slightly hesitated for a bit, and then picked up the call, a man’s voice impatiently came through.</p>
<p>“Huu, finally waited until you came online, it’s me Yun Feng!”</p>
<p>Sure enough… Ling Chen responded: “You weren’t on in the morning?”</p>
<p>Disillusion? This name seems pretty different from “Cycle of Wind and Snow” from last time. (TL: in english to show the difference, though depending on the poll I might keep it as Disillusion.)</p>
<p>“Oh, I was busy with my sister in the morning. I helped her buy a new house, to set as her studio’s office, we only settled it this morning. The house is really big, although in terms of personnel it really is… Sigh, we’ll talk about it when we get out of the Novice Village and arrive at the main city. What number Novice Village are you in?</p>
<p>“49554.”</p>
<p>“I’m in number 99999, this number is pretty nice huh, hehe. 100 thousand Novice Villages, sure enough it’s pretty much impossible to get placed into the same village. Guess we can only meet in the main city. Oh right, what level are you now?” Yun Feng expectantly asked.</p>
<p>“LV1.”</p>
<p>“Um…” The Yun Feng on the other side was clearly stunned for a bit. Right now LV3 players were all over the place, a lot were already heading for LV4, this “super expert” is his heart was still still LV1… He hurriedly said: “I’m still LV1 too, then I won’t bother you leveling, if you need anything just contact me.”</p>
<p>Hanging up, a wild boar had already charged in front of him, Ling Chen casually turned his body, calling out the novice sword, continuing to abuse the tough hided, but evidently not so smart boars.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s leveling rate was already low using his initial stats to farm monsters multiple levels higher than him, adding that he also had to take care of his sister, he wasn’t in the game for the majority of noon. His leveling speed naturally wouldn’t match those leveling madmen that had their own personal party. But he wasn’t in a rush, in the virtual game world, what decided if you were strong or weak, wasn’t just level.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Ling Chen’s experience was already at 99.7%, exterminating one more wild boar would allow him to become LV2. But at this moment, not 5 meters to his right, a white light flashed by, a big wild boar double the size of a regular wild boar appeared there. Besides its larger size, everything else about it was exactly the same. On top of its head, 2 faint golden little stars floated there.</p>
<p>Elite monster… and it’s a 2 star elite! Ling Chen’s blood slightly boiled.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Surprise! Triple updates could become a thing on weekends (at least for the moment) so look forward to it. Here’s the link for the original song along with my preferred version.</p>
<p>If you don’t know what I’m talking about then I highly advise you to check out the link in chapter 11.</p>
<p>[Head Wild Boar]: Type: Beast, Level: LV5, Grade: 2 Star Elite, HP: 750, a small leader of the mountain wild boars. possesses a larger body and stronger charging power. When struck by its sharp tusks there is a certain chance to add the bleeding effect.</p>
<p>The newly born head boar’s front hooves dug at the ground, raising its boar head, letting out a series of unpleasant cries. Ling Chen directly charged at it, the novice sword continuously striking its body… he despised these small bosses that the first thing they did when appearing was make a show of themselves, because this incredibly idiotic act would only hasten their death.</p>
<p>MISS, MISS, -9, -8.</p>
<p>4 attacks, taking away a total of 17 HP. only then did the head wild boar’s demonstration end, and letting out a strange cry, charging towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Even though its running speed is the same as a regular wild boar’s, but the pressure brought by its extra large body was a lot greater.</p>
<p>The damage dealt towards the head boar made Ling Chen slightly crease his eyebrows, facing the head boar’s brute charge, he paused for half a second, turned around and ran. The head boar following closely behind. Running a dozen steps, Ling Chen set his eyes on a half a meter thick tree in front, his speed not lowering, charging towards the tree.</p>
<p>BAM!!</p>
<p>The one who hit the tree wasn’t Ling Chen, but the head boar. When almost at the tree, Ling Chen lightly jumped, stepping on a tree branch and doing a spectacular back-flip. flipping over the head boar’s head. as for the head boar whose slow mind couldn’t comprehend what was happening, it smashed directly into the tree. Its entire body flopping onto the ground, little stars spinning above its head representing the stun condition.</p>
<p>Under the stun condition, no attack can be dodged. But Ling Chen didn’t take the chance to charge forward, instead quickly distancing himself from the head boar, leaving the recovered boars aggro area.</p>
<p>Quickly, a regular wild boar appeared in his line of sight, he charged forward, cutting at its body.</p>
<p>Against this group of wild boars, Ling Chen was already well adept. Because they only had one form of attack, and that is a body charge. If he was touched by such an attack, even he would feel like he had no face to continue living in this world. Casually tangling with this wild boar for a minute, following another stab from the novice sword, this wild boar like many of its kind fell down. Ling Chen’s experience bar instantly filled up, the level-up halo floating up from his head.</p>
<p>“*DING*… Congratulations you leveled up, now LV2, HP+10, MP+10, gained 5 AP.”</p>
<p>Finally reaching LV2, Ling Chen still put all his AP into strength without hesitating, his attack strength once again going up 10 points. He then turned around, charging back to the head wild boar’s location.</p>
<p>The head boar was still staying under the big tree, digging at the ground in boredom. The moment it saw Ling Chen approaching, it charged over with a loud cry as if seeing his mortal enemy. Ling Chen surveyed the area, laughing with a “Hehe”, turning around and quickly running towards another big tree. The head boar vigorously chased behind, and then…</p>
<p>BAM!!</p>
<p>The same back-flip, Ling Chen landed behind the head boar, and the head boar once again smashed into the tree becoming stunned… besides bumping into a different tree, the entire process was exactly the same as the first time.</p>
<p>Ling Chen charged forward, using “Full Power Strike” to unceremoniously greet its body.</p>
<p>-22, -21, -42!</p>
<p>Because the head boar was currently stunned, all of Ling Chen’s attacks hit, a spectacular critical hit on the third strike. 3 attacks, directly taking away over one-tenth of the head boar’s HP. Suffering from three strikes the head boar at last recovered from his stunned condition, and then with flames of anger, charged again at Ling Chen. And Ling Chen had already started running the moment the head boar recovered.</p>
<p>The wild boar’s running speed was greater than a player’s initial running speed, so under the head boar’s full on chase, it was getting closer and closer to Ling Chen, and then…</p>
<p>BAM!! Smashing into the tree from the first time.</p>
<p>This time, the head boar was directly knocked over, falling on the ground with its four feet facing the sky.</p>
<p>Ling Chen calmly walked forward, attacking 3 times, taking away another one-tenths of its life, and then turning around, using his fastest speed to run towards the other tree.</p>
<p>7 seconds later, the head boar once again hit the previous tree.</p>
<p>If this head boar had the slightest bit of intelligence, it would not be lead in circles by Ling Chen using such an easy method. But if it had enough intelligence then it couldn’t be called a pig then. In a short amount of time, the head boar had already been brought 4 rounds between the 2 trees. accurately being stunned by the 2 trees 8 times. The last time, Ling Chen took the opportunity to attack 4 times, clearing its HP.</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have successfully killed LV5 2 star elite head wild boar, Fame +10, gained 10 SP.”</p>
<p>A shining silver coin dropped from the head boar. Ling Chen picked up the silver coin, he then kicked the body aside, following the displacement of the wild boar’s body, two shining blue pieces of equipment appeared in front of him.</p>
<p>Iron equipment… two pieces too.</p>
<p>Ling Chen quickly picked them up. Of the two pieces of equipment of them one is a bracer made of iron, the other… was actually a ring!</p>
<p>[Iron Bracers]: Type: Handguard, Grade: Iron. Equipment Requirements: Any class LV5 or above. Sturdy bracers forged by iron. Attributes: Defense+5, Hit Rate+2.</p>
<p>Adding 2 points of hit rate, pretty good stats. If Ling Chen could have had these 2 points before, killing the mountain wild boars would’t result in so many “MISS”. To bad he can only equip it at LV5.</p>
<p>[Amethyst Ring]: Type: Ring, Grade: Iron. Equipment Requirement: None. A ring mounted with a beautiful amethyst, has a high ornamental value. Seems to be lost by the village item shop’s Boss Wang, and then obtained by the head wild boar, it will only drop when the head boar is killed the first time. Attributes: HP+100.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Rings, are very rare accessory type equipment, even more rare at the novice stage. This ring is iron-grade, adding a whole 100 HP, and it doesn’t have any requirements. This at the novice stage, could be deemed as god-like attributes. If Ling Chen equips it, his HP would more than double.</p>
<p>Although, it is clearly written in the ring’s description that it very likely is the ring that the item shop’s shopkeeper lost. When the item store shopkeeper gave the quest to hunt the wild boars he did mention his lost ring, also saying that he didn’t expect to find it… holding the ring, Ling Chen hesitated.</p>
<p>Should I return it to the item shop shopkeeper?</p>
<p>If he keeps it, wearing it can allow him to greatly increase his safety when killing monsters, even if he sold it he could sell it for an astronomical price. If he returned it to the shopkeeper… a reward was certain, but whether or not the value of the reward surpassed the ring was an unknown.</p>
<p>Thinking for some time, Ling Chen put away the ring. heading in the direction back to the village. The Novice Village didn’t have a teleport scroll, you can only get there through walking.</p>
<p>The territories for LV4 and below creatures were still packed, inside the Novice Village it was already lively and bustling. Ling Chen went straight towards the item store, turning in the quest to the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>Seeing him return, the shopkeeper looked very surprised: “Hoh! Didn’t expect you to exterminate 30 mountain wild boars so quickly, it really is surprising. Thank you for helping me relieve my hatred, here, this is your reward.”</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have completed the quest ‘Wang Ji’s Request’, gained 500 EXP, 2 silver, orange potion 10, blue potion 10.”</p>
<p>The reward at hand, Ling Chen did not leave, instead taking out the amethyst ring, placing it before Wang Ji: “Boss Wang, do you recognize this ring?”</p>
<p>Seeing the violet light in Ling Chen’s hand, Wang Ji’s eyes widened. His expression became excited: “This… this is the amethyst ring that I lost a few day ago when I was chased by those accursed boars! Young hero, where did you find it?”</p>
<p>“It dropped from a head wild boar.” Ling Chen responded.</p>
<p>“No mistake, this is the amethyst ring that I dropped. This is a birthday gift my wife gave to me, yet I accidentally lost it, I was just in the middle of thinking how I am going to tell me wife. Young hero, can you return it to me? I will repay you generously.” Wang Ji closely stared at the ring in Ling Chen’s hand, saying excitedly.</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t hesitate, returning the amethyst ring to the shopkeeper’s hand.</p>
<p>Carefully putting away the amethyst ring, Wang Ji once again looked towards Ling Chen, slightly nodding his head saying: “The amethyst ring has some decent stats, towards you heroes from another world who have newly entered the world of Mystic Moon it has a lot of appeal. Yet you didn’t keep it but returned it, kind young ones like you who would return it are very few. Here, take this. In Forgotten continent, this is a priceless treasure, but in here that is separated from the outer-world, towards me it’s value is far less than my amethyst ring. I hope that it can provide you with a certain amount of help in your future adventures.</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have completed the unique hidden quest ‘The Lost Amethyst Ring’, Fame+10, gained quest reward ‘Red Blood Fruit’.”</p>
<p>What Wang Ji gave to Ling Chen, is a small red fruit about as big as a nail. Ling Chen carefully took hold of it, when he saw its stats, his hands slightly trembled a bit.</p>
<p>[Red Blood Fruit]: A fruit that grows on the Red Blood Tree in lava, incredibly valuable. After eating it HP permanently increased by 100.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hey guys, here’s the late update. I think this triple update thing isn’t going to happen anymore. I don’t know why but I just am not able to translate today. It took me forever to translate this and it wasn’t even hard. I just couldn’t think. Just this update today guys. There might be more mistakes than usual. Special thanks to ZIP for pointing out mistakes and everyone else that has helped point out mistakes.</p>
<p>Illusion… it has to be an illusion!</p>
<p>Holding the little red fruit, Ling Chen even went as far as to rub his eyes… No mistake! It’s not 1 point, not 10 points but permanently adding 100 HP… forever!</p>
<p>Permanently adding 100 HP, even in mid-game it is enough to make people excited enough to vomit blood. At the novice stage, this kind of item is practically a cheat, it can allow a person’s overall strength to instantly pull apart from others by a street. And this kind of item, actually physically existed in front of him… and already belonged to him. (TL: Okay, so spitting blood is a common thing the chinese say to express an extreme emotion, like angry enough to vomit blood. as for the street thing, ya it’s also a common thing said to represent the distance )metaphorical/physical) between a person and others, generally by a lot.)</p>
<p>Resisting the urge to swallow the red blood fruit, Ling Chen tightly held it in his hand… good things really do happen to good people, good thing I didn’t greedily keep the ring. Even though they are both add 100 HP, but being added by a ring, and adding permanently, they are on two completely different levels.</p>
<p>“Thank you Boss Wang, I think it will definitely be a lot of help to me.” Ling Chen held back his excitement saying.</p>
<p>“Hehe, that’s good.” Shopkeep Wang started laughing, and then saying: “It’s rare to meet such a kind young man such as yourself, I think I should take out my most proud creations for you , you have the right to buy them.”</p>
<p>Finishing, Shopkeeper Wang carried over a glass cabinet from behind and placed it in front of Ling Chen. Inside is filled with little bottles of all colours. At the side there is a blue pendant.</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have unlocked hidden event ‘The Item Shop’s Hidden Merchandise’, can buy the corresponding hidden merchandise from the item shop’s Shopkeeper Wang.”</p>
<p>“Hidden merchandise?” Ling Chen walked forward, looking at the coloured bottles.</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Strength Potion]: After use physical attack strength+20, lasts 1 hour, effect does not stack. Price: 10 gold, can buy a total of 10.</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Magic Potion]: After use magic attack+20, lasts 1 hour, effect does not stack. Price: 10 gold, can buy a total of 10.</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Hit Potion]: After use hit rate+20, lasts 1 hour, effect does not stack. Price: 20 gold, can buy a total of 10.</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Speed Potion]: After use movement speed+20, lasts 1 hour, effect does not stack. Price: 20 gold, can buy a total of 10.</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Health Potion]: After use HP+200, lasts 1 hour, effect does not stack. Price: 10 gold, can buy a total of 10.</p>
<p>[Blessed Blue Pendant]: Type: Necklace, Grade: None. Equipment Requirements: None. Once a regular blue pendant, afterwards mixed with the power of blessing from Goddess Fate of the 3 goddesses from the Mood God clan.After equipping it can be revived upon death, perfect condition, after the effect the necklace will break. Price: 2000 gold.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>These are indeed hidden items, the effects of these special potions, each of them more surprising than the other. At the novice stage, if a player randomly chugged a bottle, they could easily beat-down players of the same level. That sapphire necklace even had the effect of reviving on the spot.</p>
<p>Even though they are powerful… but the prices are also each one scarier than the other. Strength, magic, health 1 bottle cost 10 gold, hit and speed potions i bottle cost 20 gold… gold! At the moment where currency cannot be exchanged, 1 gold was already a huge fortune. Ling Chen flipped through his bag, a total of 3 gold and 7 silver, this is also under the condition that he didn’t buy any potions before. Yet he couldn’t even afford to buy one bottle of hidden potion. Not to mention, having 3 gold could already be considered a rich person among players, don’t talk about extra, regular players probably don’t even have the money for potions.</p>
<p>As for the sapphire necklace… forget it, at the speed of gold farming at the Novice Village, it would probably be tough even if he saved until next year.</p>
<p>Seeing Ling Chen’s stumped expression, Wang Ji obviously knew what he was thinking, saying smilingly: “I know these items of mine are a bit too expensive, but these are my most proud creations, their effects are without complaint, relative to their effects, these prices aren’t high at all. If you can’t buy them at the moment then it’s not a big deal, my original intention for creating these potions, is to be able to help a kind and powerful hero, How about this, at the north of the village, there is a Wolf’s Cliff, there wander violent wolves, regularly attacking people. My younger son was also bitten before, he would be dead it it weren’t for some kind of good luck.. Young hero, if you can hunt 1000 wolves and bring back their teeth, I will give one of each type of these potions to you.”</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have activated the quest ‘Wang Ji’s Request 2’, Quest Type: Hidden, Quest Time Limit: 3 days, Quest Description: Within 3 days, head over the the Wolf’s Cliff and kill 1000 wolves, and bring back 1000 wolf teeth. Quest Reward: Wag Ji’s special strength potion, magic potion, hit potion, speed potion, health potion 1 each, Do you accept.”</p>
<p>“Okay, no problem.” No need to think, Ling Chen directly chose to accept. The is the first hidden quest that Ling Chen received, as expected the requirements for hidden quests cannot be compared to regular quests. Just opening its mouth and asking to kill 1000 LV5 creatures. But 5 special potions, a total price of 70 gold coins! Only an idiot wouldn’t accept. Also, the quest accepted at the smithy before also required wolf teeth, just perfectly doing it together as well.</p>
<p>“Oh right, my youngest son goes everyday in the afternoon around Wolf’s Cliff to gather herbs, if you bump into him tell him to come back earlier. Recently those wolves seem to have become even more violent than before, I’m afraid he will be in danger around there.” Before Ling Chen left, Shopkeeper Wang said so yelling at him.</p>
<p>Ling Chen headed east, crossing through a big field, and then a small canyon, arriving at the edge of Wolf’s Cliff in not even a half hour, though he didn’t see Shopkeeper Wang’s son along the way.</p>
<p>Wolf’s Cliff is the most eastern area at Novice Village 49554, because further east is a scary bottomless chasm. The atmosphere here is extra gloomy, wind howling, a series of wolf cries making people’s hearts cower. At first glance, wolf packs wander around on top of the rocky cliff, raising their necks and howling.</p>
<p>Scanning around him, besides Ling Chen, there are no other player’s around. Players with even a bit of virtual reality gaming experience understand, wolves are a very troublesome creature… It’s not saying that they are stronger than same level creatures, but that they usually move in packs. Angering one, a wolf howl, and the big group of wolves around will attack at the same time. If you have a strong enough party than you can manage, but a single person or a small party, it’s safer to go around.</p>
<p>Killing the 2 star elite head wild boar before, he gained a total of 10 AP. Ling Chen opened his stat page, putting 5 points into his only attack skill, instantly, the light for skill upgrades flashed.</p>
<p>“*DING*… Your skill has been successfully upgraded to LV3.”</p>
<p>[Full Power Strike] : Current Level: LV3, Highest Level: LV5. Points to Upgrade to LV4: 20. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, using the weapon in the hand to strike at the target in front with all your strength, 130% damage, MP Consumption: 5, Cooldown Time: 0 sec.</p>
<p>Beginner skills need very few SP to upgrade, upgrading from LV1 to LV3 in not even a day. Although, even using your toes to think you can know that, with the bullshit difficulty setting for 《Mystic Moon》, the SP required for powerful skills will for sure be a crazy amount. Those numbers will like a curse force high level players to use any method to find, wait, or steal all kinds of low level or high level BOSS.</p>
<p>Picking up the incredibly valuable red blood fruit, Ling Chen looked at it a bit reluctantly, and then threw it into his mouth, instantly, a hot feeling spread throughout his mouth, and then followed his throat down, spreading across his entire body.</p>
<p>“*DING*… You have used the special item ‘Red Blood Fruit’, HP permanently increased by 100.”</p>
<p>In a moment, Ling Chen’s HP directly rose from 70 to 170.</p>
<p>Full Powered Strike’s power once again increased, HP also more than doubled. Ling Chen picked up the novice sword, without any fear walking into the dangerous wolf territory, at the same time looking at his stats:</p>
<p>Character: Ling Tian</p>
<p>Level: 2</p>
<p>Class: Apprentice Warrior</p>
<p>Faction: None</p>
<p>Fame: 20; Money: 3 gold, 7 silver, 0 copper: SP: 5</p>
<p>Basic Attributes: Strength: 20, Constitution: 5, Agility: 5, Spirit: 5</p>
<p>Innate Attributes: Luck: 5; Comprehension: 5</p>
<p>HP: 170</p>
<p>MP: 70</p>
<p>Physical Attack Strength: 45</p>
<p>Magic Attack Strength: 10</p>
<p>Physical Defense: 10</p>
<p>Hit Rate: 5; Dodge Rate: 5</p>
<p>Critical Hit Rate: 7%; Pierce Rate: 5% (TL: Ignore defense)</p>
<p>Attack Speed: 100%; Movement Speed: 100%</p>
<p>Elemental Resistance: Water: 0%; Fire: 0%; Wind: 0%; Lightning: 0%; Earth: 0%; Light: 0%; Darkness: 0%</p>
<p>All of his AP from leveling up went towards strength, Ling Chen’s current attack strength is 45, the maximum attack for an apprentice warrior’s starting conditions.</p>
<p>Stepping within 5 meters of a wolf, the wandering wolf immediately turned around, a pair of eyes releasing a fierce glow staring at him, and then charging at him with a savage air.</p>
<p>[Wolf]: Type: Beast: Level: LV5, HP: 170. A type of more violent wolf, group creatures, will attack any outside life forms that get close.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Surprise. It would appear that after posting chapter 13, the gods of translations bestowed upon me new found-strength allowing me to translate another chapter. This humble servant is sincerely thankful oh mighty translation gods. But yeah, I felt a lot better after posting the chapter for some reason.</p>
<p>“Bears are creatures that feel no insecurity in living alone. They’re an animal that lives in isolation. Plus, they can hibernate. What a fabulous thing that is. If I were to be reborn, I definitely want to be a bear.” – Hikigaya Hachiman.</p>
<p>The wolf’s speed was clearly faster than the wild boar’s, not even getting close, an air of brutality rushing forward. When it approached Ling Chen, the wolf’s speed suddenly exploded, viciously pouncing at his chest.</p>
<p>Fwoosh!!</p>
<p>Following the slight twist of Ling Chen’s body, a violent wind blew past his face, making part of his face slightly sting. Ling Chen squinted his eyes, his right foot that stepped backward when he twisted his body taking a large step forward, novice sword plainly thrusting forward, continuously piercing the wolf twice.</p>
<p>-38, MISS.</p>
<p>Wolves are your model glass cannons, their defense a bit worse than the wild boars. But as long as you aren’t an idiot you would know that being bit by a wolf would definitely hurt more than being hit by a boar. The attacked wolf let out a pained howl, quickly turning around, but it did not attack, instead raising its head, letting out a deep howl.</p>
<p>Immediately, all the wolves within a 30 meter radius stopped what they were doing, letting out a howl similar to a respond, and then turned their heads together, charging towards Ling Chen’s location… Ling Chen examined the situation, the number of wolves pouncing at him are in total 1, 2, 3… 6, 7… including the one in front of him, a total of 8!</p>
<p>The only player here is Ling Chen, there is no one here farming to help him separate the pack, so with a howl. all of the wolves unmistakably charged at him. Against such a force, even a LV5 player… Not saying one, even a party of 5,6 LV3 players, would all run away scared, not childishly thinking that they could fight off the simultaneous attack of 8 wolves. Ling Chen’s eyes scanned their locations, but did not run out of the wolf territory, instead heading straight for the first wolf.</p>
<p>MISS, MISS.</p>
<p>The wolf’s dodge rate is clearly higher than the wild boar’s, adding the level suppression, Ling Chen’s five attacks, there were at least 3 MISS. The hurt wolf waved its claws pouncing at him, but only getting air, before its front paw even moved, Ling Chen had already accurately predicted its displacement, perfectly dodging it using the smallest movement. He then used the short opening to quickly attack, continuously cutting into the wolf’s body 3 times.</p>
<p>-37, MISS, -90!!</p>
<p>After a big “MISS”, a purple damage flamboyantly floated upwards from the wolf’s head.</p>
<p>Critical + pierce!</p>
<p>The chances of activating critical and pierce simultaneously are very small. With Ling Chen’s current 5% pierce. rate and 7% crit. rate, the chances of him simultaneously activating critical and pierce are only 3/1000. But once activated, the damage dealt was undeniably impressive. Under Ling Chen’s “critical pierce”, the wolf’s HP dropped more than half, adding the two attacks from before, it had already entered the critical state.</p>
<p>The other 7 wolves at this moment came from different directions, and then with a savage cry rushed at Ling Chen.</p>
<p>The sound of wind from 7 different directions rang by Ling Chen’s ears, his vision can only look in one direction, but in his head, there appeared 8 clear wolf images. Wolves have strong explosive power, their speed when pouncing is also relatively scary. A wolf’s pounce from the front, normal people already have a hard time avoiding it, moreover there are 7… and 1 who could turn around and bite at any moment.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s mind was completely focused, his face showing a bit of caution… this is his first time after entering 《Mystic Moon》 becoming serious. Under his acute senses, reactions and judgement that surpassed a human’s limit, when the 7 wolves raised their bodies making pouncing motions, their movements, direction, and line of displacement clearly appeared in his head. His body suddenly lowered, right foot kicking at the ground, using the force generated from the kick to charge forward with his body at an unbelievable angle. Immediately, two gusts of wind carrying a bloody aura sailed across his back. His left hand lightly touched the ground, his body doing a nimble roll using the charging momentum, The 3 wolves attacking from the left all missing, while the last 2 wolves collided with a “BAM” the instant he dodged.</p>
<p>MISS</p>
<p>Finding that Ling Chen had unexpectedly appeared at its side that wolf quickly twisted its body, opening its mouth, using its sharp fangs to bite towards his neck, but Ling Chen’s movements were a lot faster than its. The novice sword that slid across the wolf’s body with a “MISS” almost without pausing, directly cutting backwards, once again piercing the wolf’s body.</p>
<p>-38!</p>
<p>The HP of the wolf that was hit by the “critical pierce” instantly emptied. Its movements stopped, and then fell on the ground with a sorrowful howl, dropping a dark white wolf fang and 2 copper coins.</p>
<p>Conveniently grabbing the wolf fang, behind him, 3 gusts of wind assaulted him together, Ling Chen didn’t turn around, his body in a squatting position lying down in an instant, concurrently swing his right arm, a “Full Power Strike” cutting upwards.</p>
<p>SHING!!</p>
<p>3 grey wolf figures pounced over Ling Chen’s body, the one in the middle being sliced in the stomach by the full power strike, unfortunately it’s a big “MISS”. Ling Chen quickly got up, completely avoiding the attacks of the other wolves at the same time. He then pinpointed an opening, stabbing forward.</p>
<p>The pack of wolves moved crazily, bringing up sand as they pounced, accompanied by overlapping howls.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body like an illusory shadow, dancing between the grey figures of the 7 wolves, at times moving right at time moving left, and at times like having a death wishing suddenly rushing towards the pack of wolves that he purposely grouped together…</p>
<p>His positioning appeared completely random, as if moving as he pleased. Yet, if there was a player here, he would doubtlessly be dumbstruck by Ling Chen’s swaying figure. As if looking at an alien that could not be measured by common terms. Because every time Ling Chen moved, where he stepped would always be an opening that had just appeared, his next position, another opening, and the previous opening would almost instantly be covered by a frenzied wolf.</p>
<p>Under his calm exterior, nobody could imagine the number of images that instantly crossed in his brain.</p>
<p>Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Fwoosh! Fwoosh!</p>
<p>In a second, as if performing magic he shifted his body four times, when his feet landed on the ground, in front of him was the completely open wolf pack. He swiftly charged at the wolf that he had focused all of his attacks on, two “Full Power Strikes” fiercely stabbing towards it.</p>
<p>MISS, -58!</p>
<p>A blue critical damage number floated up from the wolf’s body, the second wolf also fell on the ground with a sorrowful cry, dropping a wolf fang and a red potion.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by the wolf pack, from an outsider’s perspective, each time he time dodged was always alarmingly dangerous, a hair-widths mistake and he would be buried under the claws of the wolves. Yet in such a concentrated group of enemies, the rate that he attacked was not at all low. Striking at an average of every 3 seconds, every instantaneous opening, all his moments to accurately strike. Not to mention every time he attacked, it would always strike that same target, until it fell. Not only is he avoiding their attacks, at the same time, creating openings while dodging, controlling their positions.</p>
<p>Someone that can do this to such an extent, of all the people that he knew there were only two… that is “Xia Wa”, and that underworld instructor that should already be dead –“Hell”.</p>
<p>Following the death of the second wolf, Ling Chen dealt with the situation a lot easier. The wolves’ attacks became more and more fierce, but no matter how strong their explosive power, they couldn’t even touch Ling Chen’s shadow, instead becoming dizzy under Ling Chen’s control, constantly biting their companions.</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>Following another “Full Power Strike”, the last wolf fell by Ling Chen’s feet. The entire process took not even 5 minutes. Ling Chen picked up the 8th wolf fang and placed it in his bag, expressionlessly walking towards the top of the cliff where the wolves are even more concentrated. Killing higher level monsters, he already clearly recognized the extreme drawbacks. What stands out the most is the hit rate… An average of 3 “MISS” out of 5 attacks. If hit rate could be high enough, then the rate that he killed these wolves would greatly increase. But telling him to put his AP into agility, he is extremely unwilling. Right now he wants to reach LV5 as fast as he can, closing the level gap between the wolves, and then equipping the iron bracers that add 2 points of hit rate. At that time, the rate of killing these wolves will increase by many fold.</p>
<p>A whole afternoon, Ling Chen stayed on top of Wolf’s Cliff, killing the wolves here with all his strength. 100 wolf fangs are needed to complete the blacksmith’s quest, completing Wang Ji’s quest requires 1000, in total it’s 1100 wolf fangs. At his current kill rate and the time everyday he can spend in the game world, it will probably take until around tomorrow night to finish these two quests.</p>
<p>“DING… Congratulations you have leveled up, now LV3, HP+10, MP+10, gained 5 AP.”</p>
<p>Killing wolves for an entire afternoon, the time was already approaching nightfall, Ling Chen at last reached LV3. He finally stopped for the moment killing wolves, sitting on the rock at the highest point of Wolf’s Cliff and letting out a breath. He then opened his stat page… Immediately, he rolled his eyes, almost falling from the cliff.</p>
<p>The experience points required to upgrade from LV3 to LV4 are 5 times that of LV2 to LV3.</p>
<p>The fuck…</p>
<p>Slightly hesitating for a bit, Ling Chen decided to put all of his AP into strength. He counted the wolf fang’s in his bag, then looking at the time, running down the cliff. He decided to first hand in the blacksmith’s quest,, and then go offline to take care of Shui Ruo.</p>
<p>At this moment, an incredibly desolate howl came from behind, Ling Chen paused, quickly turning around, surprisingly finding, at the spot he had just stopped, a massive 2 meter tall wolf was howling, on top of its head, 3 gold stars shined.</p>
<p>3 star elite!!</p>
<p>Changed “wolf teeth” to “wolf fang”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Wolf Leader: Type: Beast, Level: 5, Grade: 3 Star Elite, HP: 1250. The leader of the wolves, possesses an even greater body and stronger biting power. Violent temperament, will attack any being of different race that gets close, but extremely proud, will not borrow the strength of its companions.</p>
<p>1 star elites are usually elite creature a bit stronger than regular creature, 2 star elites are usual the captain, 3 stars typically are leaders. Above, are the lords that can truly be called BOSS.</p>
<p>Seeing the last line in the description, Ling Chen who was about to retreat stopped, turning around and heading towards the wolf leader. Even though this is a tempting 3 star elite, initially Ling Chen did not plan on killing it. This is because right now it is almost approaching the usual dinner time with Shui Ruo, if he attacks it now, one howl calling over the surrounding wolves, he didn’t know how long it would take to kill the wolf leader under the entanglement of the wolf pack, Shui Ruo would probably already be starving. But… if it’s just it, the situation is a lot different.</p>
<p>Stepping into the wolf leader’s aggro. range, a pair of terrifying wolf eyes locked onto him, followed by a wolf howl, the wolf lead already charged over. Not only is it bigger, its movement speed is also faster than a regular wolf’s.</p>
<p>A huge air of pressure rushed at Ling Chen, if attacked by this LV5 3 star elite, even with the extra 100 HP from the red blood fruit, he would at least lose 1/3rd of his HP. Ling Chen glanced at the positions of him and the wolf leader, looking at the ground thinking of something, he then abruptly turned his body, running down the cliff.</p>
<p>The wolf leader closely followed the running target, its running speed slowly approaching its extreme. Ling Chen’s movement speed couldn’t even compare to a regular wolf’s, don’t mention the wolf leader. The wolf leader quickly caught up to him, arriving behind in the next moment. Then, he heard an explosive howl from behind, a massive wolf paw as big as his head under a massive cry claws towards his body, glaring cold lights flashing from the wolf’s paw.</p>
<p>SWISH!</p>
<p>Howling wind brushing past his face, Ling Chen just narrowly turned around avoiding the wolf leader’s attack, body also lying sideways on the ground. The wolf leader who missed maintaining its running speed landed on the ground, the moment its front foot landed on the ground, a cold light flashed across Ling Chen’s eyes, fiercely whippinf out his right leg from his side-lying position, heavily kicking the the front leg of the wolf leader.</p>
<p>Fuck!!</p>
<p>His foot like kicking a metal board, made Ling Chen grimace in pain. Even though originally the strength of this kick couldn’t be considered much for the wolf leader, at most feeling a little pain, but, using its fast speed running down the slanted ground, and then making a pouncing motion under its high speed, after landing on the ground, under its momentum it’s very hard to stop in a short period of time, and if at this time an opposing force came from its leg</p>
<p>And so… the front half of the wolf leader’s body immediately lost its balance, heavily falling on the ground, due to the reason that the ground is slanted downwards, its body like a rubber ball rolled down the cliff, letting out savage cries as it rolled.</p>
<p>Ling Chen using his fastest speed got up from the ground, charging down the cliff. When the wolf leader’s body finally stopped, a large number of small stars circled around its head, clearly already dazed.</p>
<p>Ling Chen who ran down from the cliff jumped and sliced, “Full Power Strike” heavily cutting into the wolf leader who can’t avoid under the dazed condition.</p>
<p>-52!</p>
<p>The wolf leader’s defense is a lot greater than the regular wolves, taking the opportunity Ling Chen used his fastest speed to execute “Full Power Strike”, slowly hacking away at its health.</p>
<p>-51, -52, -104!</p>
<p>Owoo!!</p>
<p>The wolf leader raised its body in fury, lethal wolf paw clawing towards Ling Chen. Ling Chen advanced instead of retreating, following the path of the attack and charging in front of it, cutting its neck with a swing, lowering his body before the wolf could attack again, borrowing the momentum to cross under the wolf’s body, directly coming behind it, continuously striking its leg another two times.</p>
<p>The wolf leader suffering from continuous attacks had however lost the whereabouts of its target, it turned around in a cry of anger, but at the moment it turned its body, Ling Chen also quickly moved, once again appearing behind the wolf’s body, and then following with a “Full Power Strike” cutting its leg, bringing up a furious wolf howl.</p>
<p>The wolf leader’s body is very big, its length almost 4 meters, not counting the head, just the body is already 2 meters tall, but right now its big body that made people shake with fear instead became a protective screen for Ling Chen to hide his location. He is always able to perfectly return behind its body either from below, from the left of from the right the instant the wolf is about to turn around, and then follow with an attack. Every time the wolf leader turns around it either misses Ling Chen or sees his vanishing afterimage.</p>
<p>The wolf leader’s howls became increasingly furious, its movements also increasingly violent, but no matter how savage, it could never touch Ling Chen’s figure. The majority of Ling Chen’s attacks are “MISS”, the resulting damage also very limiting, but using his ghost like positioning, he used exactly these feeble attacks to point by point cut down the wolf leader’s health, cutting down its full health bar to half, and then to one quarter…</p>
<p>Five minutes later, under a sorrowful wolf howl, this new-born 3 star elite’s life hit the bottom, powerlessly falling to the ground. Until death, it never even scraped the corners of Ling Chen’s clothes.</p>
<p>“DING… You successfully killed 3 star elite ‘Wolf Leader’, Fame+15, SP+15.”</p>
<p>5 silver colored coins dropped from the wolf leader’s corpse, beside the coins, surprisingly is a pair of shoes shining a yellow colour.</p>
<p>Is it a bronze equipment? Ling Chen rapidly picked it up.</p>
<p>[Wolf Skin Shoes]: Type: Boot, Grade: Bronze, Equipment Requirements: Any class LV5 or above, rough shoes sewn from wolf skin. Attributes: Defense+8, Constitution+2, Agility+2.</p>
<p>It is bronze equipment!</p>
<p>This is the first bronze equipment that Ling Chen gained in the Mystic Moon world. Truly a bronze equipment, just LV5 and adding 4 attributes. Too bad, like the iron bracers they can only be equipped at level 5. (TL: Not sure if typo or if a stat is missing)</p>
<p>This stingy 3 star elite only dropped this one item. In addition, it also dropped some dark white wolf fangs that look a lot bigger than regular wolf fangs.</p>
<p>[Sharp Wolf Fang]: Wolf fang from the wolf leader, hard as steel, razor sharp.</p>
<p>The wolf leader only dropped 9 of this kind of teeth, putting them all away, Ling Chen left Wolf’s Cliff, heading in the direction of the village.</p>
<p>After returning to the village, Ling Chen headed straight for the smithy. Right when he was about to enter, he suddenly saw, on top of the shabbiest wall in the village, there sat a filth covered person with disheveled hair and a dirty face. He could vaguely make out, that is a shriveled up old man, his clothes incredibly torn, his hair and beard like straw nests on his head. His hands clutching his body, curled at the corner of the wall. From so far away, Ling Chen could vaguely smell a foul stench wafting over.</p>
<p>Glancing at the straw house beside the old man that looks like it could collapse at any time, Ling Chen silently thought… His is the “madman” that the Village Chief said to never get close to?</p>
<p>The same warning, the Chief should have told it to any players that he talked to, but that didn’t mean that all the players would listen to him. On the contrary, people will think that he is a special existence, the Novice Village would not arrange for a useless NPC and place it here.The more the Chief warned not to get close, the more some player’s started to get jumpy. This strange old man, could very well be hiding some kind of amazing hidden quest.</p>
<p>And so…</p>
<p>A player carefully walked over. The instant he got close, his face twisted, clearly almost being knocked out by the foul smell. He finally resisted, going forward and eagerly saying to the old man: “Hello Old Mister, is there anything I can do for you?”</p>
<p>The old man as if not even hearing him, not even moving his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“How do you do, do you need help?”</p>
<p>The old man still did not move, sitting there like a broken statue.</p>
<p>“How about, I carry you back inside, the sun outside is very hot, being exposed isn’t too good.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The old man still did not react. That player biting his teeth, actually went forward, attempting to lift up the old man.</p>
<p>“Fuck off!!!!”</p>
<p>The quiet old man finally let out a hoarse yell, his shriveled hand whipping out, slapping the player’s body.</p>
<p>BAM!!</p>
<p>A heavy sound, under a miserable cry, the player flew away as if a leaf in a fierce wind, flying from the village’s most western side, all the way to the village’s most eastern side. A damage number, slowly dimmed in the air.</p>
<p>-90000!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes became huge, his throat moving, heavily taking in a cold breath.</p>
<p>If his brain wasn’t making illusions or his eye’s didn’t have a problem, the damage caused by that old man’s random slap… was actually a five-digit damage number!!</p>
<p>All the player’s on the side waiting to watch a good show became dumbstruck, some player’s even so surprised that they fell onto the ground, faces pale. 5-digits… wrong, accurately saying the damage almost reached 6-digits, this damage is absolutely terrifying.</p>
<p>The filthy old man retracted his hand, continuing his previous action of sitting there immobile. The surrounding players subconsciously took a step back… No one dared to get close anymore.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, posts of Novice Village 49554’s mysterious old man slapping out a damage of 90 thousand filled the front of the national China area forum…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Translator: [R.E.A.D.E.R]</p>
<p>Let’s give a warm round of applause to [R.E.A.D.E.R] who is currently helping with translations. Let us join hands and work hard towards a better, brighter future where everyone is equal, where people do not need to starve, where children will all be educated. For the Motherland! (The motherland by the way does not exist.)</p>
<p>“Master Wang this is the 100 wolf’s fangs you requested.” Entering the forge, Ling Chen gave the 100 wolf’s fangs to the blacksmith.</p>
<p>“Oh! You actually completed the task so soon.” The blacksmith took the 100 wolf fangs and looked at him surprised. With one look he could see that Ling Chen is only LV3 at the moment. It truly surprised him being able to complete the quest so soon at this level.</p>
<p>“Master Wang, if it’s being used as forging materials, will these fangs be a bit better.” Ling Chen taking out the wolf leader’s nine sharp fangs, put them in front of the blacksmith.</p>
<p>“This is …… Oh! This is the wolf’s leader’s sharp fangs. If I use them to forge, I will be able to create a better weapon. Young hero, you actually killed the wolf leader, this is really a surprise. ”</p>
<p>The blacksmith exposed a surprised look. He glances again at Ling Chen, thought for a moment and said: “To have killed at least 100 wolves and the wolf leader at LV3, it seems that you are a real hero, I was ready to give you a steel dagger as a reward, but ordinary weapons do not seem to fit you. If you are willing to give the fangs obtained from the Wolf leader to me, I’ll make you a better weapon. ”</p>
<p>“Ding………….Will you hand the 9 [Sharp Wolf Fang]s to the blacksmith, and let him build an unknown weapon for you?”</p>
<p>No need to even think about this, Ling Chen chose to immediately agree and give all of the teeth to the blacksmith.</p>
<p>The blacksmith nodded. “Good… I need a certain time to forge it, but it won’t take too long, two hours later come find me, I hope I can give you a surprise.”</p>
<p>The blacksmith said, turning away and starting to prepare the forge.</p>
<p>“Master Wang, who is the old person that lives in the straw house? Do you know who he is? ” Ling Chen asked, the scenery of the damage caused by that old man’s horrific slap appearing in his mind. It shocked a lot of players, including him.</p>
<p>Blacksmith did not turn around, and said flatly: “I don’t know, except that he is a madman, the people in the village don’t know anything about him. He is crazy and is very dangerous, do not try to go close to him”. Without getting any useful information, Ling Chen had to give up, he looked at the time, and disconnected in the blacksmith shop.</p>
<p>At the usual dinner, after helping Ruo eating, he is accompanying her playing video games with her for more than an hour, and then takes her to the bath. He is taking care of his dear sister every day with meticulous care. When the night completely sinks in, he hugs Shui Ruo soft body, watching her sleep peacefully. Three years ago, she suffered from Isrock, their parents were also infected by the Irsock virus and died one year later. That is the darkest and most desperate moment of Shui Ruo’s life. During that time, every night she sleeps with Ling Chen. Gradually, she became unable to get rid of this habit. For two years, every day.</p>
<p>Staying on Shui Ruo side, Ling Chen closed his eyes but did not sleep, but instead re-entered the world of “Mystic Moon”. To complete the quest that the shop owner entrusted him he needs 1000 wolf’s fangs, he must fight wolves for a long period of time. However, the number of players approaching level 4 will be at the latest tomorrow, they would be interested and there will be more people Wolf’s cliff, with the arrival of many players leveling or questing, then it ceases to be his personal hunting ground, the collection of the fangs will be slower by many times. Therefore he decided to fight in the night.</p>
<p>A flash of white light, he appeared in the forge. Seeing him, the blacksmith stopped his movement, wiped his body full of sweat, smiling and said: “Young hero, you come just right, I have completed your weapon just a little before you came, take this I believe you will be satisfied.”</p>
<p>Then the blacksmith presented him a dagger flashing with a cold light and give it to him.</p>
<p>“Ding … …” The blacksmith’s task is completed, you received a special award, Ling Chen took a look at the cold shiny short sword’s properties.</p>
<p>[Wolf Fang Sword]: Type: One-Handed Sword, Grade: Bronze, Equipment Requirements: Any class LV5 or above, a sharp fang and a dagger made of stainless-steel, razor-sharp. Properties: attack +18, strength +3, pierce rate + 1%.</p>
<p>It was a bronze weapon! Ling Chen is surprised. In “Mystic Moon” the drop rate is poor; the game opened on the first day, if a player can get a piece of iron equipment that is already something to be proud of, if someone have bronze equipment he will be met with envious jealousy and hatred. Silver gear, the probability to get one at the starting village is small enough to be negligible.</p>
<p>And Ling Chen have already two pieces of bronze equipment, but unfortunately, he needs two more levels to reach level 5 to equip them.</p>
<p>He thanked the blacksmith, Ling Chen walked out of the forge and towards the Wolf’s cliff.</p>
<p>He knows best his body, he only needs two or three hours of sleep a day and that is more than enough. What’s more, in the game the brain is in half asleep state, ordinary people without going offline for several days is nothing much. So, even if it’s night, “Mystic Moon” has almost no decline in the number of players. Wherever Ling Chen went, he sees the people are packed. At least more than the number of monsters.</p>
<p>Taking care of Shui Ruo during the day, he had already decided to focus his game time in the evening. He goes to bed with Shui Ruo, she only needs to gently touch him if she needs him, he will sense it and get offline immediately.</p>
<p>Exiting the novice village from the eastern suburbs, no other player can be seen, it makes Ling Chen let out a sigh of relief. He speeds up to the wolves above the cliffs. When he arrives, only to find out that there is not a single wolf. Before he had time to doubt, he heard a sudden panic cry.</p>
<p>“Help … Help! Ah…! ”</p>
<p>Ling Chen looked up towards the cliff direction. He see a young man dressed in coarse clothes, he looks about fifteen or sixteen, the young man was scratching and scrambling to escape, behind him, five fierce wolf try to catch up. He is blocked from behind so he desperately ran to the cliff top, but there are more wolves there waiting for him, so he is forced to go to the edge of a cliff once, but he met a dead end.</p>
<p>Huh? It’s a player……. No, it seems not. That’s…</p>
<p>“Ah!! Warrior…… Warrior!! Please help me, I will repay you!!”</p>
<p>The man saw him, he called out with hoarse voice and cried out desperately. A sound entered Ling Chen’s ear.</p>
<p>“Ding … … You have triggered the quest ‘Save Wang Xiaoming’. Quest Type: Random, Quest Time Limit: None, Quest Objective: Save the NPC Wang Xiaoming from the danger and accompany him back to the novice village item shop. Quest Rewards: Unknown.”</p>
<p>Xiao Ming: Help</p>
<p>The random quest is different from ordinary tasks, and is obviously different from the common quest. Because its appearance has no fixed location or time, but randomly based on immediate circumstances, and the time to accept the quest is usually very short. For example, the task will only exist to save Wang Xiaoming prior to Wang Xiaoming being killed by the wolves, if nobody accepts it or no one appears, then the task will naturally disappear. People can’t receive quest if the quest giver hasbeen killed.</p>
<p>Bam(sounds of someone falling) Wang Xiaoming in panic tripped on a stone and fell to the ground, he turned around, looking frightened at the approaching wolf. Ling Chen is too far away, and is unable to reach to him in time. Ling Chen quickly moves forward, his eyes quickly swept around, then slanted his body, grabbed five stones, then threw them while running towards the front.</p>
<p>Five stones fly into five different trajectories, as if they are attracted to the wolfs, the throw were extremely accurate each stone hit the body of a different wolf.</p>
<p>A stone hitting a target is nothing; two stone struck into two different objectives is quite remarkable .But, throwing five stones at the same time at fast-moving target and hit all five of them. This can only be described as frightening.</p>
<p>-1,-1,-1,-1,-1.</p>
<p>The five wolves immediately turned around, glared at Ling Chen with hatred and their gazes focused on him, a dust storm immediately rushed towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Although there are five of them, Ling Chen cannot sense any threat, he welcomed them with his beginner sword, he killed them one by one, two minutes later, the five wolves collapsed at his feet.</p>
<p>He pick up the wolf fangs and copper, Ling Chen said to the NPC still recovering from the shock: “Are you all right?”</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoming stood up from the ground, patted to remove the dust on the body, with a pale face said: “It is OK, I was really scared, I thought I would be killed by the wolf. I just wanted to collect two pieces of rare herbs at the edge of a cliff, I did not expect two wolf to step out of the edge of the cliff and attack me. Fortunately, I run fast. I am grateful to you for saving me. I am still afraid right now, not many people dare to walk through these monsters’ territory, can you escort me home? My house is the item shop in the village.”</p>
<p>It turns out he is the item shop son that goes every day around Wolf’s Cliff to gather herbs.</p>
<p>Ling Chen said immediately yes, then escorted Wang Xiaoming to the village.</p>
<p>Safely returned to the item shop, Wang Xiaoming threw himself in front of the item shop owner Wang Ji, and almost blurted out in tears: “Dad!! It’s good to see you, just now I thought I will never see you again. ”</p>
<p>“How … What’s going on?” The shop owner got a big shock.</p>
<p>“I just went to the Wolf’s Cliff to gather herbs, when a wolf suddenly attacked, if that warrior had not appeared on time I would be killed and become food to the wolves, he is also willing to escort me back, if not for the warrior, I can never see you again.” Wang Xiaoming with an excited look explained to his father what has happened.</p>
<p>After knowing what had just happened, the item shop owner broke a cold sweat, he turned to Ling Chen, his face full of gratitude, said: “Thank you, young hero, thank you for saving my son as a reward, I am willing to give you my proud creations, they should belong to a kind and powerful hero like you.”</p>
<p>With that, the item shop owner put the items in front of Ling Chen, all items were given to him.</p>
<p>“Ding … … You successfully completed the task of ‘Save Wang Xiaoming’. Because in the entire progress Wang Xiaoming was not hurt, the quest is completed perfectly, you will get the highest reward.</p>
<p>“Fame +10, gold coins +20, experience +900</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Strength Potion ]x 10,</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Magic Potion] x 10,</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Hit Potion]x 10,</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Speed Potion]x 10,</p>
<p>[Wang Ji’s Special Health Potion]x 10,</p>
<p>and special equipment [Blessed Sapphire Necklace]</p>
<p>“Ding … the quest ‘Wang Ji’s Request 2’ is automatically canceled. ”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>50 bottles of potions and a resurrection necklace, even though Ling Chen usually had a steady mind he cannot help but be stunned for a long time, almost unable to believe it. Previously for 5 bottles of potions, he did not hesitate to accept the daunting task of collecting 1000 wolf’s fangs. And now in front of him, he had 50 bottles of potions and a necklace worth 2000 gold.</p>
<p>He is simply too HAPPY!!! (TL: Need to emphasize on the happy, the author even bothered to write in English).</p>
<p>Although, if you look at it realistically, the random quest that Ling Chen came across was actually very difficult. If it wasn’t Ling Chen at the scene but another player, even a big party, they would have all been unable to simultaneously absorb the aggro. of the 5 wolves under such an urgent situation, thereby saving Wang Xiaoming. Not to mention that throughout the entire process he did not allow Wang Xiaoming to receive a single point of damage. So this kind of reward, really is not that excessive.</p>
<p>Although there are only ten bottles per potion, if using them at critical moments, it will be able to display a strong effect. Putting the potions and sapphire necklace away, Ling Chen thanked the item shop owner, once more returning to Wolf’s Cliff, starting to move back and forth between the wolves, ruthlessly killing the wolves here.</p>
<p>By killing the wolves without rest, the experience bar was growing little by little, approaching close to level four.</p>
<p>While it is night in China, at a certain place on the other side of the Earth the Sun hung highly in the sky.</p>
<p>《Mystic Moons》’s distributor, the world’s largest virtual game company – Universe Corporation Headquarters (TL: The direct translation is “Outside the sky”, the Chinese term refers to the space outside of Earth, so essentially outer space, the universe)</p>
<p>“Why are you guys still coming!! Release my granddaughter, I did everything I was told.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my dear Mr Smith, would you please calm yourself, your granddaughter is very safe, she spends every day happily, still immersed in the world of “Mystic Moon” not willing of come out. You can rest assured that we will not hurt you and your family… as long as you obediently listen to our words.

Of course, only supervision, as long as you don’t do anything we wouldn’t like to see, whatever you do we will not interfere, if you have a request, we will even help.”</p>
<p>“You … … You are all lunatics!! Tell me what kind of scheme there is in 《Mystic Moon》?! ”</p>
<p>“Scheme? Oh no no no! There aren’t any schemes, to be accurate; even we do not know what’s inside. Just like right now, we still don’t know what’s inside.”</p>
<p>“What you people are is using all of humanity as your guinea pigs!”</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. Smith, please calm down a bit, to create a virtual world that affects the whole of mankind, has that not always been the biggest dream of your life?

<p>“You are all crazy!!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your compliment, but I suggest you stay silent. Otherwise, your lovely granddaughter may stay forever in the world of 《Mystic Moon》 unable to come out.(TL: not SAO or Log Horizon pls) While all I need to do is gently press the button in my hands, and the greater part of America will forever disappear from the world, do you believe me?” (Sylver: Weirdest way I have ever seen America in Chinese.Took me forever to figure out and I’m still not even sure if I’m right)</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Ding … … Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV4, HP +10, MP +10, you gained 5 AP.”</p>
<p>“Ding … … You have grasped the trainee skill for apprentice warriors [Little Crescent Slash]</p>
<p>Fighting the majority of the night, practically without a moment of rest, the level of Ling Chen finally reached four. He still added all the AP to the strength value. Reaching LV4, the level suppression by the wolves already reduced to very little, his hit rate towards the wolves also increased, his efficiency naturally increasing by a lot.</p>
<p>Opening the status panel; the Ling Chen looked at his newly grasped trainee skill.</p>
<p>[Little Crescent Slash]: Current level: LV1, Highest Level: LV5. Points to Upgrade to LV2: 5. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, with their weapons and cross cutting ahead, drawing a small sword arc, dealing 90% regular damage towards 3 targets in a 2 meter forward area, MP Consumption: 5 points, Cooldown Time: None..</p>
<p>The second skill of the apprentice warrior is an AOE skill, even though it can only attack three targets at most, but when dealing with many enemies it’s already enough to play a great role. Ling Chen immediately and without hesitation use the last 5 attribute points to upgrade the newly learned little crescent slash, after a burst of light, little crescent slash has been promoted to second grade.</p>
<p>[Little Crescent Slash]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level: LV5. Skill points required for promotion to LV3: 25. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, with their weapons and cross cutting ahead, drawing a small sword arc, dealing 100% regular damage towards 3 targets in a 2 meter forward area, MP Consumption: 6 points, Cooldown Time: None..</p>
<p>After upgrading little crescent strike, the range increased from two meters to three meters ahead, its usefulness greatly enhanced. Ling Chen immediately turned and ran towards the place with two wolves, a little crescent slash sweeping forward, the sword slash enveloping the wolves.</p>
<p>-55,-54.</p>
<p>The two wolves were hit simultaneously, their life falling near one-third. When they turned around and started biting, Ling Chen let out another little crescent slash… Upon rising to LV4, under the cooperation of his little crescent slash and full power strike, in only less than ten seconds, the two wolves all fell down.</p>
<p>Level up to LV4, also gaining little crescent slash. The rate of killing wolves has become more efficient, but mana consumption is also greatly increased. He had constantly return to the novice village to buy blue potions, then continue farming to reach LV5 at the Wolf’s Cliff. At the same time paying attention to any movement from the west. At this time, there should be almost be new players arriving here.</p>
<p>After fighting at the wolf’s cliff for four hours, the time neared six o’clock in the morning and in one hour he needs to make breakfast for Shui Ruo, and then take her out to feel the morning breeze. Looking at his current progression, he see his current experience is LV4 with 5o%, the distance to level 5 is not far away.</p>
<p>There is still no sign of other players. Ling Chen went to a safe area to hide and prepare to go offline. Although his physique is different from ordinary people, but it always better to have a rest. An hour of sleep is enough for him.</p>
<p>Ow ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(wolf’s howl)</p>
<p>At the moment Ling Chen is about to enter to the command to go offline, a loud drawn out wolf howl travelled over, reverberated through the entire Wolf’s cliff. This wolf howl is completely different from ordinary wolves. It is louder and more majestic compared to that of a regular wolf’s, even the 3 star elite wolf leader that he previously killed. Ling Chen looked up at Wolf’s cliff… A wolf sat on the rock at the highest point of the cliff, the wolf measures up to three meters high, a giant wolf looked up, looking straight into the sky, overlooking the world with gestures like a King(TL: think of Gilgamesh in FZ or FSN). It’s color is not gray, the body’s surface is covered with a light layer of gold… And in its surroundings, the many wandering wolves in all direction are crawling on the ground, each howl making their bodies shake</p>
<p>[Gold Battle Wolf]: Type: Beast, Level: LV7 , Grade: Lord, HP: 6ooo, the KING of wolf’s cliff, the highest ranked in all the wolf population, he has a very high prestige in the wolf population, its body shines with golden light, possesses claws and teeth that can easily tear apart any creature, its majestic howl can cause shock and cause dizziness to all targets around him.</p>
<p>Looking at the giant golden wolf positioned at the top of the cliff, being worshipped by all the wolves, Ling Chen’s pupil’s slightly retracted.</p>
<p>Lord BOSS!!!</p>
<p>He turned out to be a Lord Boss!!</p>
<p>1 star to 3 star elites are only elites, at the lord, that is in true essence a BOSS. Its ability no matter life, defense, attack, speed… all of it overshadows the 3 star elites. And even more dangerous, is lord BOSS usually have varied and sophisticated attacking skills, also having a certain IQ. A BOSS, is even stronger than 10 3 star elites of the same level.</p>
<p>A level 7 lord BOSS… Ling Chen did not move forward, he glanced at his own equipment, wondering whether to try the challenge. Because even he is not sure if he is capable of defeating the powerful BOSS, after all his equipment is really too garbage, their stats to extreme. Against little elites that have no skill and intelligence it’s okay, but against a Lord BOSS, nevertheless a Lord BOSS 3 levels higher than him, with his current equipment, he honestly couldn’t raise any confidence.</p>
<p>Usually, to deal with a similar level Lord BOSS, people need dozens or even more players gathering into a party and working together to fight it</p>
<p>However, the temptation of fighting the Boss is too great. Ling Chen knows the probability of the emergence of a Lord BOSS is very low, this golden Wolf may be the first Lord Boss to have appeared in the novice village No. 49554, if the news of its appearance were to spread, the entire Wolf’s cliff will be filled with players within a short time. If he gives up now, before long, other players will come here and discover it he will not have another chance again. If he missed this one, who knows what year and month he will see another Lord BOSS. (TL: As the MC, Lord Bosses are too low grade for you, of course you want see that many)</p>
<p>After half a minute of silence, Ling Chen takes the newbie sword out again, and calmly walks toward Wolf’s cliff.</p>
<p>He had decided, with his level 4 body, newbie sword in hand, to challenge the Golden Wolf that even a couple dozen of LV7 players might not even be able to take on.</p>
<p>But if he chose to accept the challenge, then he must win, because he could never afford to lose!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You know, the thing I hate about a lot of Chinese Web Novels is how obvious their chapter titles are. I’m pretty sure for some books you can understand overall what happens by just reading chapter titles. I know they’re supposed to represent the chapter but I think they can be a bit more ambiguous. Like maybe this chapter could be “Descent” or something. Still pretty obvious but at least it could have some other meaning. Just a piece of my mind.</p>
<p>1 step, 2 steps,…10 steps… Ling Chen got closer and closer to the Gold Battle Wolf, but the Gold Battle Wolf as if not even seeing him, continued maintaining his haughty pose of staring at the sky, or maybe it couldn’t be bothered to initiate the attack on a weak human. Ling Chen stopping his step, grabbing a rock from the ground, flicking his hand and throwing it at the golden wolf, hitting it square in the head.</p>
<p>The Gold Battle Wolf became angered, a furious howl, suddenly jumping down from the rock, quickly pouncing at Ling Chen’s location… Its instantaneous explosive power shocked Ling Chen, this Gold Battle Wolf didn’t need a build-up, jumping almost 10 meters from a stand still, descending on him from right on top of him, a great feeling of pressure making him unable to breath for an instant.</p>
<p>This kind of explosive power and mobility… it’s movements speed, is at least double that of a regular wolf’s!</p>
<p>Creatures with fast movement speed for Ling Chen are the most troublesome type, because his own movement and mobility have been greatly restricted. Against the pounce of the Gold Battle Wolf, almost at the same time, Ling Chen heavily kicks the ground, rapidly jumping backwards. The Gold Battle Wolf accompanied by a howling wind fell onto his previous position. Bringing up the sand on the ground. Pouncing from such a long distance, yet the Gold Battle Wolf only stopped for a moment after landing on the ground, then suddenly turning around, once more pouncing in Ling Chen’s direction.</p>
<p>What strong maneuverability you have… Ling Chen once again shocked, he didn’t have more time to think, his body already making a lightning quick reaction, with his left leg as a pivot swiftly turning his body, at the same time lowering his body. “WHOOSH…” a gust of wind swept across his face, making his face sting. Biting his teeth, when the Gold Battle Wolf passed by his body, his novice sword quickly struck, landing 3 regular attacks on its body.</p>
<p>MISS, MISS, -32.</p>
<p>3 attacks, 2 MISS, the only attack that landed being reduced by its defense by half. Ling Chen didn’t stop, folding his body at the same time the Gold Battle Wolf turned around, once again returning behind it, a “Full Power Strike” stabbing forward.</p>
<p>MISS.</p>
<p>Quickly retracting the novice sword, right when Ling Chen was about to attack again, a sense of danger suddenly came from his mind, he didn’t even think, using his fastest speed to abruptly lie down, his entire body sticking to the ground. (TL: Spidey senses!)</p>
<p>WHOOSH…</p>
<p>A golden tail as along as 2 meters swept over his eyes, if his reaction or movement was slower by a second, we would have been flung far away by the tail.</p>
<p>It can actually also use its tail to do a sweeping attack… quickly getting up Ling Chen clenched his teeth. Like this, his method of circling the Gold Battle Wolf is definitely not going to work.</p>
<p>Like that, he could only be on the defensive. The Gold Battle Wolf that turned around pounced at him continuously, its strong explosive power and mobility putting Ling Chen in a state of danger, besides using all of his strength to dodge, he pretty much had no chance to retaliate.</p>
<p>Pounce!!</p>
<p>Another terrifying pounce being dodged by Ling Chen, Ling Chen quickly scanned the terrain behind him, trying to finding something that he could take advantage of, an instant later, he did not sense the Gold Battle Wolf once again pouncing over. He saw the Gold Battle Wolf standing in place and raising its head, the gold aura around his body becoming thicker, a long cry and then about to howl to the sky…</p>
<p>Shit!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen was very surprised, not able to pay attention to anything else, using his fastest speed to escape backwards.</p>
<p>Ow~~~~~~~</p>
<p>A deep, resounding wolf howl reverberated through Wolf’s Cliff, at the same time the wolf howl rose up, a circle of gold light spread from its body, charging in all directions, continuing to spread around a 5 meter radius of its body before disappearing. Even though Ling Chen ran at the first moment, but he was still a bit late, a gold light sweeping across him right when he was about to leave the 5 meter radius…</p>
<p>-108! (TL: First Blood!)</p>
<p>A 3 digit damage floated upwards from Ling Chen’s head, making his HP instantly drop by a large chunk…. If weren’t for the fact that he ate the red blood fruit, this moment he would have already been insta-killed. At the same time his HP dropped, Ling Chen’s brain suddenly shook, all consciousness quickly dissipating.</p>
<p>This is the dazed effect brought from the Gold Battle Wolf’s Sonic Shock!!</p>
<p>After howling the Gold Battle Wolf looked at the dazed target in front of it in contempt, when that golden wolf paw of its was about to make contact with Ling Chen’s chest, his initially blank eyes suddenly in an instant regained clarity, his immobile body suddenly flying backwards like an arrow, just barely avoiding the Gold Battle Wolf’s fatal attack, and then quickly taking out a red potion to recovering his HP.</p>
<p>Being struck by the Gold Battle Wolf’s Sonic Shock, regular players would be dazed for at least 3 seconds. But Ling Chen… He only used less than 2 second to recover from the dazed condition, and making the swiftest reaction the instant he recovered. Ling Chen covered in cold sweat could only continuously retreating, losing all chances of retaliating. Under the attacks of the golden wolf, he was bit by bit forced towards the top of the cliff.</p>
<p>Another backwards jump, Ling Chen’s body came in contact with a hard rock, he had already retreated to the rock at the highest point of the cliff. He looked behind him, and then with a big flip, came directly behind the rock. Staring at the Gold Battle Wolf across from the rock. (TL: He either does a flip or goes around the rock.)</p>
<p>Your screwed… his hand pressing on this two meter wide, one meter tall rock, Ling Chen squinted his eyes staring at the Gold Battle Wolf, slowly raising the novice sword.</p>
<p>At that moment, suddenly an excited shout came from the bottom of Wolf’s Cliff.</p>
<p>“Lord… Lord BOSS!! Rich… We’re rich!!! Quick… contact the chief, tell him we found a Lord BOSS!! Call everyone over!!”</p>
<p>At some unknown time a party of 30 people arrived at the edge of Wolf’s Cliff, the leader is a person with a body of light armor flashing a blue light, a wooden longbow in hand, evidently an apprentice archer. He widened his eyes staring at that giant wolf covered in a golden aura, so excited that even his voice is shaking. What does a Lord BOSS mean? It means large amounts of SP, fame, EXP, and high quality equipment and items that can make the eyes of people red enough to vomit blood. But the chance of a Lord BOSS appearing is just too low, from the opening of the game ’til now, until now the appearance of a Lord BOSS hasn’t even been heard of in Novice Village No.49554 . Them haphazardly coming here, and actually bumping into one, it’s practically a giant pie falling from the sky, it’s hard not to be excited.</p>
<p>In the end players finally came! Ling Chen’s eyebrows tightened.</p>
<p>“There’s also a person on top!!”</p>
<p>“Ignore him, he’s already a dead man, actually thinking in delusion of soloing a Lord BOSS, he’s practically suicidal… Archers, mages, attack! Concentrate all you attacks on the Lord BOSS… shoot down that annoying guy at the side while you’re at it!” The leader pointed upwards, loudly shouting commands. Immediately, a dozen or so archers and mages hurriedly moved forward, heading straight for the top of the cliff… With their group of 30 or so people they definitely have no chance of defeating the Lord BOSS, so at the moment all they can do is kite with ranged professions, and then wait for back up to arrive.</p>
<p>Ow~~~~~!!!!</p>
<p>The Gold Battle Wolf in the middle of facing Ling Chen from across a rock let out another long howl, but this howl is different from the Sonic Shock a moment ago. Right when Ling Chen was about to take advantage of the opening when the the golden wolf is howling, suddenly, countless wolf howls from the surroundings rang overlapping… Under the howl of the Gold Battle Wolf, all of the wolves on Wolf’s Cliff made a response, and then turned their bodies together, charging towards Ling Chen’s position, in a moment, a hundred wolves running. (TL: It’s not literally saying a hundred wolves running even though there are a lot of wolves but it’s referring more to the atmosphere created, a not so metaphor like metaphor. Though I think it’s referring to both actually.)</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!” (TL: I too speak in exclamation marks)</p>
<p>Facing a Gold Battle Wolf alone is already incredibly difficult, now adding a party of players that are sure to make a move on the Gold Battle Wolf… Especially not expecting, under the Gold Battle Wolf’s howl, actually calling over all of the wolves. Even if Ling Chen is unwilling, he is forced to understand, him wanting to kill this Gold Battle Wolf today is no longer possible</p>
<p>This is the strength of a Lord BOSS.</p>
<p>The nearby by 7,8 wolves already closing in on him, pouncing towards him. Ling Chen who was forced to give up quickly shifted his focus, looking for an opening to escape the encirclement of the wolves and escape down the cliff. Facing the simultaneous pounce of 2 wolves, he swiftly ducked his body, sticking to the rock and changing positions, going around the attack of the two wolves. The moment his body steadied, a sense of danger rushed at him from in front. Under the shrinking of his pupils, he saw disorderly arrows and different coloured elemental bullets heading straight for him…</p>
<p>This kind of attack, regardless if he stopped, moved forward, left, or right he would definitely get hit, he can only avoid it moving backwards… And behind, he would immediately fall into the encirclement of the wolves and the Gold Battle Wolf. Even more wolves are heading over here, at that time it will be even harder to escape.</p>
<p>But at this time, he doesn’t have any choice, his body that hadn’t even steadied turned around in a fairly twisted position and jumped forward in a low position… Because these players didn’t dare to get close, they all started their attacks at a range that they can just barely hit the wolves, Ling Chen’s jump backwards just perfectly left the range of the arrows and magic, dodging them all. But, because he dodged too hastily, he landed on the ground in a fumble, falling backwards a few steps, all the way to the edge of the cliff, almost falling into that bottomless chasm. But, stopping his body doesn’t mean that he is same, not even getting up yet, that resounding wolf howl rang beside his ears.</p>
<p>Ow~~~~~</p>
<p>Under the wolf howl, a gold light came from in front his body, behind is the bottomless chasm, there is no way to dodge it. Ling Chen could only watch himself being struck by the Gold Battle Wolf’s Sonic Shock again.</p>
<p>-105!</p>
<p>His consciousness once again going blank, and then rapidly recovering under his incredibly strong will, but the moment his mind recovered, a wolf had already pounced at his body.</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>His body moved backwards from the hit, his feet stepping on air, and then falling down under the sound of the whistling wind…</p>
<p>The instant that his body fell, his eyes that had become deadly cold caught a clear glimpse of the leader of that group of players — Hei Yan Kuang Gong (Black Flame Bow).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After Ling Chen fell down the cliff, the Gold Battle Wolf and the wolves immediately changed their targets, all turning around and facing the group of players at the bottom of the cliff. After the Gold Battle Wolf’s howl, all the wolves under chaotic cries charged towards those player’s that forced Ling Chen down the abyss.</p>
<p>The players had a tough time fighting one wolf alone, over 100 wolves charging over at once, the leader also a Lord BOSS, those archers and mages at the head immediately lost all the colour in their faces. All stopping their attacks, lifting their feet and running away. Good thing they controlled their distance well, reaching the safe area before the wolves could reach them. Yet, before they could even catch a breath, they shockingly saw, that massive, golden wolf actually charging directly out of the area of Wolf’s Cliff, stepping into the “safe zone”, carrying a mighty air and pouncing at them.</p>
<p>“Quick… quick, retreat!!”</p>
<p>The unsuspecting players turned pale with fear, but the speed of the Gold Battle Wolf is simply too quick. The mage at the the back of the group just wanted to start running, and was already caught up by the Gold Battle Wolf. A savage pounce landing on his body, directly insta-killing him, and then another long jump, landing in the middle of the group. Wolf head rising, howl shaking the air, a Sonic Shock enveloping the escaping players.</p>
<p>Ow~~~~~</p>
<p>-101, -99,- 85,- 100.. (TL: 101, LOL, get it… I’ll shut up…)</p>
<p>3 apprentice elemental mages, 2 apprentice archers getting insta-killed, the 1 surviving archer and 2 apprentice shield guards all in critical condition, being dazed by the Sonic Shock. The Gold Battle Wolf swung its tail, 1 bow, 2 shields also falling onto the ground.</p>
<p>In just a moment, the Gold Battle Wolf dealt with 9 people like a wind sweeping fallen leaves, Black Flame Bow’s forehead started sweating, yelling while retreating: “All shield guards… Hurry and block it!!”</p>
<p>The last four shield guards in the group bit their teeth and charged forward, using their wooden shields to hit the golden wolf. As the class with the strongest defense and HP, when grouping together to fight strong monsters, they achieved the effect of a central pillar. But, 4 LV4 shield guards wanting to hold against a LV7 Lord BOSS is undeniably an overly fanciful illusion. The Gold Battle Wolf’s first pounce, and the 4 shield guards are already on the ground, and then 2 ruthless stomps, these shield guards only managed for three of the Gold Battle Wolf’s attacks before all dying.</p>
<p>Although, with the interference of the 4 cannon fodders, the rest of the players finally got away. The Gold Battle Wolf glanced at them, not chasing. It turned around returning to Wolf’s Cliff, standing on that rock at the top of the cliff, proudly looking down at those players that no longer dared to get close.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, groups of players began arriving under the cliff. For some unknown reason, the information that a Lord BOSS is at Wolf’s Cliff spread out, more and more people knowing. Unable to resist the temptation, countless player swarmed over, in an instant, the bottom of the cliff is a massive black swarm.</p>
<p>“This Lord BOSS was first discovered by us the Black Flame Gang, if all the friends here can do us a favor and give the BOSS to us, if we meet in the future we can have a good talk.” The amount of people continuing to increase, Black Flame Bow’s face also became increasingly darker. He knows that wanting the boss for himself is no longer possible, in the crowd, he looked at one after another powerful guild names within the virtual game world. (TL: Lots of guilds carry over from previous games)</p>
<p>“So what if you’re Black Flame Gang? It’s not like this Lord BOSS was raised by your family, whoever gets it gets it!!” A loud voice coming from the crowd.</p>
<p>“Hehe, whoever has the ability will get the Lord BOSS, is it not?”</p>
<p>A casual voice came from not too far away from Black Flame Bow, Black Flame Bow angrily glanced at him, his face suddenly freezing, that person…</p>
<p>The Yan Huang alliance also came!! (TL: Yan Huang refers to two kings in chinese legend who are considered the ancestor’s of China. Chinese people are also known as the “Descendants of Yan Huang”)</p>
<p>The amount of people continued to accumulate, eyes of greed all falling upon that shiny, golden big wolf, but no one moved forward, because whoever went first, not only will they become cannon fodder, they will also become the target of the public.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s restless heart had already calmed down, because he has been maintaining a falling condition for more than a minute.</p>
<p>The whistling wind drowning his sense of hearing, when he fell down the chasm, his heart was filled with resentment, even though he was already destined to be unable to kill the Gold Battle Wolf, but if be wanted to escape, even if another double the number of wolves came they couldn’t even stop him. But it happens, right when he had calculated his route of escape a hail of arrows and elemental bullets came flying over, forcing him to retreat, falling into this seemingly endless chasm.</p>
<p>Black Flame Bow…</p>
<p>Black Flame…</p>
<p>He thought of 3 years ago that Black Flame Gang that had already resounded throughout China, it’s overall strength in China’s top 30 guilds!</p>
<p>I, Ling Chen, actually have a day when I am pushed to death…</p>
<p>Black Flame Gang… saying the name under his breath, Ling Chen’s gaze flashed an intense coldness.</p>
<p>Already falling down who knows how deep, the surrounding is already completely dark. His falling speed had already reached terminal velocity. This kind of height, is more than enough for him to fall to death a dozen times.</p>
<p>Exactly what kind of chasm is this, actually with such a terrifying depth. The Mystic Moon continent is 2 parts land, 8 parts water, in reason this kind of depth should have already reached water level. The Village Chief once said, the novice villages are all a bunch of islands spread out on an endless sea, the sides of the Novice Village, are all vast ocean as far as the eye can see. The existence of this chasm defies logic.</p>
<p>But no matter what, this kind of height, him falling to death is certain.</p>
<p>Inside of Ling Chen’s eyes, weak dots of lights suddenly appearing. He felt surprised… At such a deep location, light from above can not reach here, why is there suddenly weak light appearing, is it…</p>
<p>Ling Chen rapidly looked downwards, a pale area instantly appearing in his eyesight, these lights, actually came from below. At the same time, an increasingly obvious change started to occur to the surrounding airflow.</p>
<p>Almost about to reach the bottom of the chasm!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen gathering all of his concentration, taking a deep breath, tightly shutting his eyes, silently feeling the change in the surround air current, feeling that he is becoming closer to the bottom, more and more closer…</p>
<p>BAM!!</p>
<p>-2600!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body landing… smashing heavily onto the extremely hard ground. His entire body shaking, at that instant he even felt as though his entire body was falling apart, internal organs violently shaking, HP also being cleared in an instant.</p>
<p>“DING… You have died.”</p>
<p>The same time the system message sounded, a blue light accompanied by a light cracking sound rose from Ling Chen’s chest, that is the light from the sapphire necklace.</p>
<p>“DING… ‘Blessed Sapphire Necklace’ activated, you have been revived, HP recovering to max.”</p>
<p>“DING… ‘Blessed Sapphire Necklace’ broken, cannot be repaired.”</p>
<p>The empty HP then recovering fully in an instant, Ling Chen took off the sapphire necklace in front of his chest, finding that the exterior was already covered with cracks, the sapphire necklace initially releasing a blue glow now completely dull.</p>
<p>Ling Chen who was guaranteed to die, under the effect of this sapphire necklace escaped death.</p>
<p>The sore feeling in his body starting to quickly dissipate, his partly dazed brain also finally waking up. Ling Chen stood up, looking at the surroundings. This is the bottom of the abyss, it’s impossible for any light to come through. But here there is strangely a hazy white light, allowing Ling Chen to clearly see the surrounding dozen meters. Ling Chen observed for a long time before confirming, what is releasing the light is the ground, most likely some kind of special stone the releases a weak light.</p>
<p>Behind Ling Chen is a wall in which the top cannot be seen, his hand pressing on the wall, an incredibly cold feeling on his hand. Suddenly, Ling Chen ‘s mind became alarmed… He suddenly thought of, after falling to death, he can choose to return to the city, thereby returning directly to the Novice Village. But because of the blessing of the sapphire necklace, he didn’t die… and, the Novice Village didn’t have a teleport scroll this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Then, how is he supposed to get back!?</p>
<p>Above, is a rock wall so high that its height cannot even be estimated, falling down from it already used a minute, climbing upwards…. That’s just an impossible thing!!!</p>
<p>Cold sweat, slowly seeped from Ling Chen’s forehead. Under this kind of situation, death, seems to be the only way to leave. But, in the 《Mystic Moon》 world, there simply isn’t a suicide setting.</p>
<p>It can’t be that, he will be forever trapped here!?</p>
<p>If Ling Chen falls for 60 seconds, and we just say that he has been falling at terminal velocity from the start which is apparently 56 m/s for a human, the depth of the chasm is around 3360 m aka 3.36 km. So, basically like falling from the top of Mount Fuji. I’m too lazy to calculate the distance traveled during acceleration. Next time on Shura’s Wrath, 1 vs 1000!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hello to all leechers, this is SPATAAAA!!!… erm [R.E.A.D.E.R], this chapter will show us how a man can become a Terminator. Have a nice lecture.</p>
<p>PS: Hm, ’tis me… second translation today but don’t expect that many in the future. Though I’m really doing this on a whim.</p>
<p>How can he leave the world of “Mystic Moon “, Ling Chen’s mind is still a bit chaotic After all, if there is no way to escape from the abyss, he will really be stuck there forever. This is not a laughing matter… There is no chance to restart in the 《Mystic Moon》 world, if he wanted to delete his account he can’t ever go back again. This setting for Mystic Moon is very fair, but also relatively ruthless.</p>
<p>After waking up Shui Ruo he took her out to feel the morning breeze. While feeding her breakfast, Ling Chen’s mind wandered many times. Coaxing Shui Ruo to sleep after breakfast, Ling Chen re-entered the world of Mystic Moon.</p>
<p>Today is the second day of Mystic Moon. (TL: first person stuck in a cave)</p>
<p>“DING … Welcome back to 《Mystic Moon》, we wish you a happy experience.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen reappears in the bottomless pit that makes people hopeless, he looks around him, the space stretches a couple dozen meters, where his eyes reached, all directions are walls so high that the top cannot be seen, unable to find any gaps. He looked up, due to the height, he can only see a gray haze, almost unable to see the existence of any light. Ling Chen stood thinking for a long time, walking towards the wall, then slowly walking along the walls, at the same time with every step, using the novice sword in his hands to hit two times on the stone wall.</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>Ling Chen eyebrows tightened up, he walk at an uniform and slow pace, he is not willing to be trapped here, although it looks hopeless, but at least he doesn’t want to give up without trying.</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>Dong, dong …</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s footsteps suddenly stopped, turning his body and glancing at the wall, proceeding to continue moving forward.</p>
<p>Dong, dong ……</p>
<p>Dong, dong ……</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>Ling Chen took a step back, standing still, and looking at the wall in front of him. That hollow sound just like knocking on a fragile wooden board, this sound told him, the surface of the stone walls is thin, as thin as a sheet of paper. He reached his hands out, touching the wall. Exactly as he thought, this part of the wall is already thin to the point that it can’t be thinner, instead of saying it’s a stone wall, it would be better to say that it is a thick pile of dust accumulated over a long period of time. Because right when Ling Chen’s hand touched it,, slightly applying pressure, the 2×2 meter part of the wall under a cloud of flying dust… directly collapsed</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…..”</p>
<p>In front of him, appearing a pitch black unknown space.</p>
<p>“This is amazing … what it is in here!?” Looking at the entrance of the space, Ling Chen did not move forward, his face showing a deeply puzzled and slightly surprised look. He was not surprised by the collapsing wall, instead…after the “wall” collapsed, the incredibly accurate 2×2 meter square hole! Exceptionally smooth edges, square, straight.</p>
<p>This is a door, a real door!</p>
<p>The door can’t be naturally formed, but can only be made by someone, or some creatures with a very high intelligence. The so-called wall is not a real wall, the debris that was flying in the air was also not simply dust… The debris under his feet told him, this is clearly a wooden door, simply rotting because of the long time it existed, and then being covered by a thick layer of dust after a long time of quietness, making it seem as one with the surrounding walls. But because it is already complete rotted, just lightly pushing, and it already fell over.</p>
<p>To think that there used to be life that lived here before… and from the looks of it after that, it’s already been a long time since anyone’s set foot here.. Perhaps the original owners who lived here already perished.</p>
<p>A faint light coming from the space ahead, Ling Chen slowly stepped in.</p>
<p>“Ding … you have discovered a mysterious new area, Fame + 1oo, EXP + 1ooo.The new area is temporarily designated as ‘The Forgotten Cave’, the system has registered ‘The Forgotten Cave’, and has activated automatic exploration. Since you are the first player to discover ‘The Forgotten Cave’, the system will explore and give you the information obtained in a timely manner. ”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “……”</p>
<p>A place that the system doesn’t even know about it!? (TL: AI? Robot rebellion? Terminator?)</p>
<p>It’s impossible! (TL: the MT said unscientific) (Sylver: Yes, for things that don’t make sense one way the Chinese say it is “This isn’t scientific”. Makes sense I think)</p>
<p>He doesn’t think much about it, stepping across the square door, entering into the space ahead.</p>
<p>“Ding …… You have entered the first floor of ‘The Forgotten Cave’, a large number of wandering cursed termite are present, please be ready for battle.</p>
<p>“Cursed termites? Such monsters exist?” (TL: using a wood door to stop termite? BRILLIANT!)</p>
<p>Ling Chen has not enough time to be surprised, already seeing in front of him a large group wriggling white shadows.</p>
<p>It’s a giant ant with a white body and a meter long! (TL: ok now I see why he insist on 2×2)</p>
<p>Cursed termites: Type: Demonic Beast, Level: 3, HP: 100, originally a group of ordinary termites, under long-term infection from an unknown source of demonic magic they become evil, gaining huge body and weak magic attributes, their temperament has become violent, and they will take the initiative to attack any intruder. Their attack can cause the “blind” effect.</p>
<p>Those termites are the biggest that Ling Chen has ever seen of his life. They are also the first monsters with magic properties.</p>
<p>Cursed termites inherit the habits of ordinary termites, they are always in a group, never alone, they move very quickly, they all gathered in front of Ling Chen in a flash.</p>
<p>Such a large group of enemy is enough to make a LV10 player’s blood freeze. But for Ling Chen who can fight at level 2 against level 5 evil wolves, those termites with lower level than him aren’t dangerous. He steps towards the ant colony, and using [Little Crescent Slash] attack sweeping out, hitting the three termites in front of him.</p>
<p>-59,-59,-120。</p>
<p>A termite died immediately from the critical hit, the other two were left with less than half of their remaining life, Ling Chen used again [Little Crescent Slash] and the two termites fell down. While attacking, he constantly shifts his position, so there is no chance of being surrounded by the termites, after each time he change position, there will be two termite that fall under his novice sword, after a little while, this not too large space filled with the bodies of termites, once a termite died another will appeared from nowhere, densely packed and rushing towards him.</p>
<p>“Ding … … System discovery, there is a way to move forward to ‘The Forgotten Caves ‘ second area, killing 1000 ‘ cursed termites ‘, and the road will open on their own. ” (TL: termite-nator!!.. really lame, tired.)</p>
<p>As soon as Ling Chen kill a termite a warning flashed, and his speed is becoming faster and faster. Although there is a high number of termite and they attack together, but this time, they have encounter Ling Chen with pinnacle positioning and judgement, they fall one by one, from the beginning to the end they couldn’t graze Ling Chen once. Instead, their excessively huge number allow the [Little Crescent Slash] to be used in its full potential, Ling Chen killing rate also reaching its peak.</p>
<p>100 … (TL: a power of 5….(pathetic))</p>
<p>200 …</p>
<p>300… (TL: power level of 322 not bad, but nothing compared to me…)</p>
<p>600… (TL: wh..what a power of 710 and it’s close!!!…)</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>800 … …</p>
<p>900 … … (TL: po..wer level of 1307!?)</p>
<p>Ling Chen with the continuous the action of attacking and shifting his position, while silently calculating the remaining number. In less than an hour later, with a strike from Ling Chen, the 1000th termite falls at his feet. After killing the termites, no new termites appear, everything has returned into silence, only Ling Chen and the termite’s body’s remains.</p>
<p>Boom……</p>
<p>A dull sound reach his ear, in front of him a glowing wall suddenly shifted, descending slowly and revealing a passage, the passage revealed the walls stopped moving. The door is very narrow, enough space for one person.</p>
<p>“Ding …… you killed successfully a thousand ‘cursed termites’, the door to the second area of “The Forgotten Cave” is revealed.</p>
<p>It’s another door…</p>
<p>What is hidden inside? At the end of the door, what is it?</p>
<p>If the termites were cursed by the influence of magic, then the previous owner, the one living here is a demon?</p>
<p>While thinking, Ling Chen walk toward the front, stepping into the gate, and a sound rang in his ears: “Ding…… There are stronger guardians in “The Forgotten Cave” second area, please be ready for the battle.”</p>
<p>Passing through the door completely, he heard a noise behind him, he just walked past and the door closed behind him without warning. Ling Chen frowned, he tried pushing the door, but it stood motionless.</p>
<p>Why did the door shut so suddenly……you can only move forward, not backward! ?</p>
<p>He didn’t have much time to be surprised, because in front of him, came at least more than a dozen monsters carrying the atmosphere of danger.. Then under the light, he saw a monster as big as an adult alligator …… a giant scorpion!</p>
<p>[Cursed King Scorpion]: Type: Demonic Beast, Level: 5, Grade: 1 Star Elite, HP: 410, originally a group of ordinary Scorpion Kings, after long-term infection of demonic magic from unknown an origin, their body grow bigger and gained weak magical attributes, their nature has become more brutal, they will search actively and attack any intruder, their stinger can poison the target, Their attack can cause “Instant Death”.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “……”</p>
<p>1,2,3…..10….20!!!</p>
<p>20 cursed scorpion kings.</p>
<p>Ling Chen holds the newbie sword tighter, his eyes beaming, because it’s not just 20 normal monster …but 20 1 star elite monster!!</p>
<p>One-star elite is 2 times stronger than ordinary monsters of the same level, but nothing more. But it is, after all, elite monsters, very low frequencies of appearance, But it is after all elite monsters, frequency normally appears very low, regular players usually have to help god knows how many old grandmas across the street before being able to meet an elite monster while farming. And here, before his eyes, actually all of a sudden appearing twenty.(Sylver: The grandma thing is basically talking about karma)</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s agitation towards the 20 elite’s monster is not out of fear … … Instead, 20 one-star elite, that represents a full 100 skill points!!</p>
<p>Thinking of it, his saliva almost drooled out.</p>
<p>Ordinary players encounter the same level of one-star elite, against one they can be handle it, against two they can try their luck, if three appears he can only run.In the whole China, not many people, can feel arrogant in the front of full 20 elites-one-star monsters with levels above themselves and thinking about the soon obtainable SP.</p>
<p>END( phew translating and getting distracted with music doesn’t help)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“I’ve decided to upgrade the Character Stat Page when his stats page is shown is the novel.</p>
<p>“I’ve forged my own way alone. While you were consoling and fighting with one another, I faced everything myself, head on. Now look at how strong I am.” – Hikigaya Hachiman</p>
<p>I cannot say that for myself. Thanks for your help [R.E.A.D.E.R]</p>
<p>The twenty level 5 star elites did not make him feel any pressure, but instead a burst of excitement, a 100 skill points to add to his potential, enough to upgrade [Full Power Strike] and [Little Crescent Slash] up a level. He first action was to evade the scorpion king tail, and launch a powerful counter- attack.</p>
<p>“[Full Power Strike] “</p>
<p>Shifting his body with a small movement, the poisonous darts of the scorpion hit empty space, in an instant later; his body has been hit by two powerful attacks.</p>
<p>MISS，-62。</p>
<p>Around him, 5 scorpion kings all surrounding him, 6 poisonous stingers wrapped in a black light piercing towards him, sealing off all areas of movement. Scorpion tail pierce is the scorpion king’s only form of attack, but this single attack is relatively scary, a 100% chance to add the poisoned condition, and has a certain chance of adding the instant death effect… Which also means that once activated, no matter how much HP you have you will directly die.</p>
<p>“Ha!” {Sylver: Just a sfx he says while jumping. It’s also used when attacking or exerting strength.)</p>
<p>Ling Chen without fear, a big leap, easily evading all of the scorpion stabs, and landing directly on the first Scorpion King’s back, then without looking, a [Little Crescent Slash], the attack sweeping across hitting the three scorpion kings at the same time. At the time when he was at level 2 he was surrounded by seven or eight level 5 wolves even with their combined attacks, they didn’t even touch a strand of his hair, the mobility and speed of the wolves are better than the Scorpion King, he doesn’t need to pay any attention, he doesn’t fear their concentrated attack, he even hoped for them to attack him together, because that will allow them to be killed quicker under the [Little Crescent Slash].</p>
<p>Dodge!</p>
<p>Dodge!</p>
<p>Dodge!</p>
<p>Twenty Scorpion King are surrounding Ling Chen, however, the King Scorpion can only attack at close range, a few can reach to attack Ling Chen, the rest can only stay in one place. Ling Chen doesn’t attempt break out of this encirclement, but attacks continuously the Scorpion King group, evade, attacks, evade…If that was against the wolves, he will not do so. But against this group of Scorpion Kings …… their attack is dangerous, but their mobility and attack speed is low, Ling Chen has an advantage over this kind of opponent, a powerful attack but can’t hit is useless against him.</p>
<p>Dodge, move, stop, attack …… every movement is graceful relaxed and casual, he had only a pair of eyes, but they seemed to be able to notice in advance all the movements of the next Scorpion King, he can accurately ascertain where the next attack would be. People with strong judgement are not uncommon, but under such circumstances to be able to make such a swift and accurate judgment …… almost like a “prediction” capability (TL:… wait Prediction? Ling without g&gt;Lin?&gt; Lin Wan Er?&gt;Zhan Long?&gt; he is Li Xiao Yao KID!!!) , which is not what a normal person can do. With this kind of capacity he makes those elite monster look like fragile toys easily breakable in his hands. Not long later the scorpions became dizzy from Ling Chen’s control, their already low attack rate because of the constantly disappearing target becoming lower and lower, until the death of the first Scorpion King, the 20 elite monster did not touch him even once.</p>
<p>“Ding … … You successfully killed a 1 star elite “Cursed Scorpion King”, Fame+5, Skill points +5.”</p>
<p>“Ding … … You successfully killed a 1 star elite “Cursed Scorpion King”, Fame+5, Skill points +5.”</p>
<p>“Ding … … You successfully killed a 1 star elite “Cursed Scorpion King”, Fame+5, Skill points +5.”</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>One, two, three … … 10 … … 15 …</p>
<p>With the last [Little Crescent Slash] sweeping through the remaining two Scorpion Kings fell near his feet.</p>
<p>“Ding … … You successfully killed a star elite “Cursed Scorpion King”, Fame +5, Skill points +5.”</p>
<p>“Ding … … You successfully killed a star elite “Cursed Scorpion King”, Fame +5, Skill points +5.” Current SP: 115.”</p>
<p>“Ding …… you have eliminated all of the “Cursed Scorpion King”, the door leading to a third area of “The Forgotten Cave” open.”</p>
<p>Rumbleee ……</p>
<p>After the announcement, a deep, loud sound from the front, the flat door in front of the wall staggered, revealing a semi-circular dark passage.</p>
<p>Killing all monsters, a passage is available; will all the areas be like this? What is hidden in the cave.</p>
<p>Without doubt the monster of the next area will be stronger. Ling Chen didn’t move forwards immediately, he opened his skills panels, upgrading [Full Power Strike] and [Little Crescent Slash] to the next level.</p>
<p>[Full Power Strike] : Current Level: LV4, Highest Level: LV5. SP to Upgrade to LV5: 100. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, using the weapon in the hand to strike at the target in front with all your strength, 140% damage, MP Consumption: 5, Cooldown Time: 0 sec.</p>
<p>[Little Crescent Slash]: Current Level: LV3, Highest Level: LV5. SP to Upgrade to LV4: 80. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, with their weapons and cross cutting ahead, drawing a small sword arc, dealing 110% regular damage towards 3 targets in a 3 meter forward area, MP Consumption: 6, Cooldown Time: 0 sec.</p>
<p>The two upgraded skills have stronger attack, but it does not change anything else. Ling Chen examines his backpack, he still has more than 200 bottles of mana potions. In order to stay for a long time at the wolf cliff, he spent almost all of his gold coins to buy mana potions, and now it seems to have been a very correct decision. Fighting such a large number of monsters without any replenishment beside the potions dropped by the monsters, facing an unknown number of monsters without knowing the number of areas, each potion is very valuable.</p>
<p>His remaining health potion in addition to the drops from the monsters is more than enough.</p>
<p>After upgrading his two skills, there is only 70 skills points remaining. At level 4 with two skills upgraded to level 4 and level 3 , he is certain that he is the only one in the novice village N° 49554, because the elites and Boss are really rare.</p>
<p>Once his mana is full, Ling Chen moves forwards, to the next area. He is wondering, what is hiding in the deepest part of this strange cave under the chasm.</p>
<p>After passing through the gate, the usual sound sounded behind Ling Chen, Ling Chen moving slightly sideways, confirming the door has been firmly closed, leaving no gap.</p>
<p>The pathway to the back is shut again, there is no escape route, only forward.</p>
<p>“Ding…… You have entered “The Forgotten Cave”’s third area, kill all the ‘Cursed earthworm’s, and the door to the fourth area will open. ”</p>
<p>In front of Ling Chen, multiple black bodied 3 to 4 meters long snakes …… No, it’s the giant earthworm crawling around — yes, those are three meter long worms!!</p>
<p>There are 10 of them.</p>
<p>[Cursed earthworm]: Type: Demonic Beast, Level: 5, HP: 1200, Grade: 3 stars elite, a group of ordinary giant earthworms, under long-term infection of demonic magic from an unknown origin, with strong body and weak magic attributes, its nature becomes violent. The weak looking body can exhibit an incredible strength, once something is wrapped by it, there is no way to escape.</p>
<p>His intrusion does not seem to have alerted the giant earthworms, they aren’t like the termites and King Scorpion who take the initiative to attack, they are just crawling around. Ling Chen also stood motionless…… In front of him there are actually ten level 5 three stars elite.</p>
<p>10 three stars elites! This is impossible to find such a good opportunitie in a normal map. If such a lineup is found by a guild, they would be overcome with joy, but if found by a single player, then they can only run away. Soling 10 three-stars elite? You think you’re Xia Wa!?</p>
<p>Ling Chen narrowed his eyes, becoming a narrow slit. Monsters with flexible bodies, their defense is the lowliest of all the monsters, their vitality is also poor, appearing as the the easiest to kill. However, they are also more difficult to deal with than the monsters with high attack. Because they have no hands and feet, they can do movements that normal monsters can’t do, like twisting their body and attack from a different direction, their improvable attacks are difficult to avoid and defend.</p>
<p>If their body attaches onto you, you are finished.</p>
<p>Against one, he can handle it. But if the ten were to attack…… Even he had to choose to run away. Ten giant earthworms wrapping from various angles is hard to escape and evade.</p>
<p>These earthworms do not seem to attack first.</p>
<p>In that case …</p>
<p>Ling Chen bent down, softly grabbing pieces of gravel on the ground, with a flick; throwing the gravel to the nearest earthworm.</p>
<p>Bang,- 1.</p>
<p>Hiss</p>
<p>The earthworm that was hit let a weird sound out, crawling even faster, then in a second, shot out like an arrow arriving in front of Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Ling Chen dodged to the side, his right hand raised, delivering a precise Full Power Strike when the giant earthworm passed by.</p>
<p>-85!</p>
<p>The earthworms defense are generally bad, the damage inflicted from this attack and a critical hit aren’t too far apart.. Ling Chen immediately turns his head to see the other giant earthworms. They are still crawling around without showing any reaction.</p>
<p>Very good! Ling Chen feeling at ease. If those ten 3 stars elites act like the termites and the Scorpion King and rush over, he will choose to run away immediately, but if there is only one then, this is child’s play.</p>
<p>He will kill them one by one! (TL: sounds like a villain)</p>
<p>This pile of the giant earthworms that cause him a headache, has become a lot of skills point and equipment.Ten 3 stars elite, is enough to make anyone feel excited from the gain.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yahallo! BTW, this is not an Oreigaru blog for any new people seeing this.</p>
<p>I think the schedule will be everyday at 10:30 GMT… for now.</p>
<p>“When humans are faced with truly terrifying circumstances, they don’t think about other people around them. They’re even willing to sacrifice those around themselves. By exposing that unsightly part of them, they can no longer get along.” – Hikki</p>
<p>Just facing a single giant worm, Ling Chen doesn’t feel any pressure, but this doesn’t mean that he will face it carelessly. On the contrary, his expression concentrated, the nerves in his entire body tightening. He steps forward, right hand drawing a rapid arc, cutting through the giant earthworm’s body, and then quickly retreating before it can retaliate, making the giant earthworm not have a chance to hit him.</p>
<p>Against the giant earthworm, he didn’t use the method of rapidly circling around its body this kind of method that can have the highest attack rate, because for the giant earthworm whether you are in front, behind, left or right it doesn’t make a difference, it can attack from all angles without the need to turn around.. So, after Ling Chen finds an opening, the best point of retreat is backwards. Even though the giant earthworm’s body is massive, its movement speed is not so different from Ling Chen’s. The flying attack it uses its explosive power to achieve also requires 1 second of immobile buildup. Even at close range he can easily avoid it, this kind of attempt to control his movements doesn’t waste much of his energy or thoughts.</p>
<p>And so, he retreats after hitting, and then swiftly moving in during the openings after the giant earthworm’s attack, jumping away at the first moment after striking. When he is not able to retreat, or can possibly alert the other giant earthworms, he will give up the chance to attack during an opening, crossing from beside the giant worm, and then attacking and retreating from the other direction. Just like that the earthworm without any intelligence followed behind Ling Chen eating his dust, being lead by Ling Chen from one end to another, and then from that end back, repeating back and forth.</p>
<p>Same level players can easily defeat monsters of the same level or stats. The biggest reason is because the monsters do not have intelligence comparable to a human’s. The giant earthworm’s defense is complete garbage, but its dodge rate is very high. Out of 3 strikes an average of only 1 will hit, but the giant earthworm’s HP still falls at a fast pace. One of Ling Chen’s strikes can bring down over 1/20ths of its HP, five minutes later, the first giant earthworm under an ear screeching scream collapses onto the ground.</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully killed 3 star elite “Cursed Giant Earthworm”, Fame+15, SP+15.”</p>
<p>Without wasting a lot of energy, and without any sort of danger, the first giant earthworm fell, giving 15 SP and 15 Fame. Beside the corpse, a blue light faintly glowing. Ling Chen took a breath, going forward and picking it up.</p>
<p>[Rock Needle]: Type: Dagger, Grade: Iron. Equipment Requirement: Assassin class LV5 or above, a sharp dagger forged from iron, possesses weak earth element attribute. Attributes: Attack+12, Attack Speed+30, attacks deal an additional 5 earth damage.</p>
<p>Daggers are the weapons with the fastest attack speed, every dagger will give a different range of attack speed. But this dagger is clearly of no use towards Ling Chen. Putting it away, repeating his previous action, picking up a rock on the ground, smashing it towards another giant earthworm.</p>
<p>The second earthworm is immediately drawn over. Ling Chen turns around and retreats, leading until a position he is satisfied with, and then commencing the previous attack method.</p>
<p>Under his method of attack of controlling them back and forth, and taking them out one by one, averaging every 5 minutes, there will be a giant earthworm whose HP is cleared, becoming his EXP and Fame. Occasionally also giving a LV5 equipment.</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully killed 3 star elite “Cursed Giant Earthworm”, Fame+15, SP+15.”</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully killed 3 star elite “Cursed Giant Earthworm”, Fame+15, SP+15.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen repeated the action of drawing over the giant earthworms, and then using the exact same method to individually kill them. Time slowly passed by in this dusky space, the “hiss” noise becoming increasingly smaller. Finally, an hour later, the tenth giant earthworm also under the last hissing sound fell over like mud. Two silver coins and a red glow dropping from its body.</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully killed 3 star elite “Cursed Giant Earthworm”, Fame+15, SP+15.”</p>
<p>“DING… Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV5, HP+10, MP+10, gained 5 AP.”</p>
<p>Killing elite creatures will not only give SP and fame, but also a decent amount of EXP. Killing the last giant earthworm, Ling Chen’s LV4 experience bar instantly filled up, leveling to LV5.</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully exterminated all of the ‘Cursed Giant Earthworms’, the door towards the fourth area of the Forgotten Cave has been opened.”</p>
<p>The rumbling sound of the stone door opening once again sounded, the wall in front, another hidden door slowly opening.</p>
<p>Coming towards the corpse of the last giant earthworm, Ling Chen picked up the silver coins and that object releasing a red glow… As he thought, this is an energy crystal.</p>
<p>[Beginner Strength Crystal]: Type: Energy Crystal, Grade: Beginner, Attribute: Fire, Effect: Physical Attack Strength +3%.</p>
<p>This is the first energy crystal up to date that Ling Chen obtained from a monster, and it’s of the lowest grade. It’s easy to see how low the drop rate for energy crystals is. Wonder how rare the energy orbs that are a level above energy crystals are. Ling Chen lifting his wrist, touching the energy crystal towards the empty hole on the Moon God Bracelet, a weak red light flashing by, followed by a system message of “Slotting Successful”, and the beginner strength crystal is already perfectly slotted into the Moon God Bracelet, his attack strength also increasing by 3%.</p>
<p>10 giant earthworms dropped a total of one beginner energy crystal and 5 pieces of equipment, 1 iron grade rock needle, 1 iron grade metal shield, and 3 pieces of equipment that he can immediately use.</p>
<p>[Beast Skin Armour]: Type: Upper Garment, Grade: Bronze, Equipment Requirement: Any class LV 5 or above, a rough piece of armour made from animal skin, flickering a weak earth element glow, Attributes: Defense+12, Constitution+3, Earth attribute resistance+3%.</p>
<p>[Beast Skin Trousers]: Type: Lower Garment, Grade: Bronze, Equipment Requirement: Any class LV 5 or above, a rough trouser made from animal skin, flickering a weak earth element glow, Attributes: Defense+10, HP+20, Earth attribute resistance+3%.</p>
<p>[]Nimble Ring]: Type: Ring, Grade: Iron, Equipment Requirement: None. Ring that bears some ethereal energy. Attributes: Agility+2, Hit Rate+2.</p>
<p>10 3 star elites only dropping 5 pieces of equipment, but still considerably kind and dropping an energy crystal and an incredibly rare accessory type equipment — Nimble Ring, For Ling Chen, his level reaching LV5 isn’t simply an upgrade of 1 level. Reaching LV5, those pieces of equipment he can finally use have determined that his overall stats will go through a complete change.</p>
<p>Equipping the Beast Skin Armour, Beast Skin Trousers, Nimble Ring, and then throwing away the Novice Sword, equipping the Wolf Fang Sword specially forged for him by the Novice Village’s blacksmith, and then equipping the Iron Bracers and Wolf Skin Boots, replacing all of the novice equipment. Besides his head equipment and accessory type equipment, his entire body is covered in at least iron grade equipment, his overall stats increasing greatly.</p>

<p>Changing into all new equipment, Ling Chen’s overall stats flew upwards. Looking at his current stats, Ling Chen is certain, if under this condition he went and attacked the giant earthworms from before, his efficiency would at the very least double. Not only have his stats greatly increased, his SP, has already accumulated to a whole 220 points.</p>
<p>Opening his skill page, Ling Chen put his SP into the two skills he possessed, right away, in a white light, Full Power Strike and Crescent Slash upgraded again.</p>
<p>[Full Power Strike] : Current Level: LV5, Highest Level: LV5. Max Level reached. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, using the weapon in the hand to strike at the target in front with all your strength, 150% damage, 2% chance of dazing the target for 23 seconds, MP Consumption: 5, Cooldown Time: 0 sec.</p>
<p>[Crescent Slash]: Current Level: LV4, Highest Level: LV5. SP to Upgrade to LV5: 150. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, with their weapons and cross cutting ahead, drawing a small sword arc, dealing 120% regular damage towards 4 targets in a 4 meter forward area, MP Consumption: 7, Cooldown Time: 0 sec.</p>
<p>Full Power Strike has reached its maximum level, its power reaching its peak, at the same time having a chance to add the daze condition. Crescent Slash’s power, attack range, number of targets and damage all increasing. Finishing with the two skills, there are still 40 skill points remaining. If he gets another 100 SP, his two trainee skills will all reach max level when he is LV5, attaining a state that regular LV10 players might not even be able to reach.</p>
<p>His condition right now cannot be compared to a few minutes ago, Ling Chen looked at the time, walking towards the open door, The 3rd area was guarded by 10 3 star elites… Then in front, could very likely be a Lord BOSS guarding!!. If it was at LV4, before entering he would use a relatively long amount of time to think of possible situations and different kinds of coping mechanisms, but now, even if 2 LV5 Lord BOSS are waiting for him, he is not afraid.</p>
<p>“DING… You have entered into the fourth area of the Forgotten Cave, the fourth area is guarded by the ‘Hell Spider’, please be prepared to battle.”</p>
<p>Rumble….</p>
<p>Just like before, the moment he enters, the stone door behind automatically closes, once again cutting off his path of retreat. In front of him, a 1 meter tall black figure stands there motionless, as if awaiting his arrival. The same time Ling Chen saw it, two dots of dark green coldness also fixed onto his body.</p>
<p>That is a giant black spider! (TL: Holy Shit! Kill it, kill it, kill it!. I would seriously shit my pants and start crying if I saw a massive spider bigger than me… or even the size of my toes)</p>

<p>Which is why you guys shouldn’t hesitate to leave a suggestions or questions in the comments. Also, if you have a suggestion to make about the overall translation, put it in the suggestions page. Thanks. Also, closing the poll by the end of today so put in your opinions quickly.</p>
<p>[Hell Spider]: Type: Demonic Beast, Level: 5, Grade: Lord, HP: 3800, A type of very scary man-eating spider. Its entire body is covered in deadly poison that can easily kill people, the area it appears in will definitely fall into disaster, thus becoming a target of elimination for humans, disappearing from the land thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>LV5 Lord BOSS!</p>
<p>Once again glancing at his stats, Ling Chen picked up the wolf fang sword, taking a light breath, taking the initiative and charging towards the hell spider. At the same time, the hell spider also charging at him, that body that makes people terrified once the nightmare of countless people, because it doesn’t even need to purposely release its poison, all you need to do is touch its body, and you will be contaminated with a hard to cure deadly poison.</p>
<p>One man and one spider charging at each other head on, their distance from each other becoming closer and closer… And then, the two bodies reached each other.</p>
<p>FWOOSH.</p>
<p>The sound of colliding bodies did not appear, Ling Chen’s body crossed from beside the hell spider’s body, at the same time a damage number floating up from the spider’s head.</p>
<p>-204!</p>
<p>Not only did the first attack hit, it is also a magnificent critical pierce. Maxing full power strike, Ling Chen with his greatly enhanced stats can easily deal over 100 damage to this LV5 Lord BOSS.</p>
<p>1 attack hitting, Ling Chen did not stop, swiftly turning around, attacking it with 3 continuous strikes before the hell spider can turn around.</p>
<p>MISS, -103, MISS.</p>
<p>The hells spider’s scary counterattack immediately came, its body carried by 8 legs rapidly moving forward, bumping towards Ling Chen. As long as any part of its body can make contact with Ling Chen, it can make Ling Chen lose at least half of his health. Its sudden increase in speed made Ling Chen almost get touched. He rapidly retreats, and then with a roll, dodges the hell spider’s attack. The hell spider unable to stop, rushes into the wall. It shakes its head, quickly turning around, swinging its head. Immediately, a large group of green fluid spraying towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Lord BOSS have many varied forms of attack, the most dangerous time is the time before finding out all of its attack methods. The instant the green fluid appeared, Ling Chen had determined that this fluid can spray 10 to 12 meters, the area it covers is an entire 90 degrees. He rapidly jumps backward, and then stepping on a rock beside him, using it to jump sideways, rolling out of the area covered by the poisonous fluid. At the same time memorizing the angle and area of the poison spray, along with with the short preparations move before spraying. (TL: Not sure what the 90 degrees means.)</p>
<p>SSSS!! (TL: Sound of spider web being sprayed or flying through the air)</p>
<p>A sharp, air splitting sound came from in front, a small, almost unseeable white dot suddenly approaching in Ling Chen’s vision. Ling Chen’s pupils shrank, not even thinking, rapidly lying on the ground. Immediately, a thin white string flying over his face…</p>
<p>Spider silk!</p>
<p>The spider silk that he dodged touched the wall, sticking to the wall as if nailed to it, connecting a taut white rope from the hell spider to the wall.</p>
<p>SSSS!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body not even steadying yet, the second spider silk already shooting over. Ling Chen’s right hand pushed at the ground, rolling away, moving towards the left, and then using the momentum his foot kicking the ground, jumping sideways and rising, at the same time avoiding the third string of spider silk that suddenly shot towards him, staggering a few steps backwards before steadying. The second and third spider silk also separately sticking at his previous locations, at the other end, connected to the hell spider’s body.</p>
<p>These spider threads are not a simple white colour, its exterior faintly covered by a light green glow. One can imagine, the spider threads are also contaminated with poison. If touched, not only will you be entwined by the threads, your HP will also be quickly devoured by the poison.</p>
<p>While standing, it was a simple matter for Ling Chen to avoid the spider silk. He constantly shifts his position, turning his body, strands of spider silk shooting past his body… but, Ling Chen’s eyebrows became increasingly tighter. Such a big spider, it has to have a scary amount of spider thread, if he continued dodging like this, there wouldn’t be any chance to attack. And the scariest thing is… after shooting outwards the spider silk does not disappear, instead sticking to the walls or ground, gradually forming a bigger and bigger spider web. Everytime Ling Chen retreats, the spider web will then grow a bit, the amount of space he can use becomes smaller and smaller… In the end, he will have nowhere to go, completely falling into the spider’s web.</p>
<p>Lord BOSS really are one more troublesome than the other! Ling Chen bit his teeth, and then lifts his head while dodging, looking at that hell spider releasing spider silk. Finally, his gaze fixed upon the hell spider’s abdomen, the area shooting out spider silk… There, seems to be a red glow weakly flickering. (TL: X marks the spot… or a glowing red light)</p>
<p>His eyes moving, Ling Chen’s foot lightly tapped the ground, bypassing another spider thread, and then like an arrow quickly flying forward, heading straight for the hell spider.</p>
<p>SSSS!</p>
<p>SSSS!</p>
<p>Getting closer, it also becomes harder to dodge. The speed the spider threads shootout at is very fast, and the intervals between spider threads is becoming shorter. Normal players almost have no chance of dodging at such close range, not to mention avoiding while moving at high speeds. Ling Chen used his fastest speed to charge forward, his gaze as sharp as a blade’s edge. When that white dot appears on the hell spider’s body, his body based more on instinct reacts, continuously turning his body twice, perfectly avoiding the two spider threads, and then lowering his body, a low roll, just perfectly dodging the third spider thread. At the same time, he also just charged in front of the hell spider, a full power strike smashing towards its abdomen area that shoots the spider silk.</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>No damage number appeared, but under this attack, the hell spider’s body was actually smashed backwards, and then its body shaking, directly falling onto the ground. Its 8 legs twitching in pain, also no longer shooting out spider threads. The area that was struck, that red glow flickering even more obviously.</p>
<p>Nice chance!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen rapidly moved forward, using his fastest attack speed to attack the currently immobile hell spider… The area that he is attacking, is exactly the red glowing area.</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>BAM!</p>
<p>Three attacks, none of them bringing up any damage, the hell spider’s HP also didn’t drop even a single point. When the hell spider stood up from the ground, Ling Chen’s fourth attack once again struck its abdomen.</p>
<p>Crack…</p>
<p>Ling Chen seemingly heard some kind of shattering sound.</p>
<p>And the hell spider that just stood up once again fell back to the ground, its entire body not moving, as if dead, the red light at its abdomen also completely disappearing.</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully destroyed the hell spider’s spider core, hell spider unable to move for at least 5 seconds, defense dropping to 0, dodge dropping to 0, will create a new spider core after 5 seconds.” (TL: So this orb thing people who read chinese novels or watch wuxia/xianxia shows should understand. It’s kinda like the source of power that manifests itself within one’s body as a sort of orb thing. I don’t really have a better word for it and welcome better suggestions. Am now calling it core)</p>
<p>Without even thinking, Ling Chen swings the wolf fang sword, using full power strike to heavily attack this hell spider that is completely at his mercy.</p>
<p>-138, -136, -274, -132, -135!</p>
<p>The advantage from adding extreme strength is clearly highlighted at this moment. Under the hell spider’s condition of being unable to defend and dodge, Ling Chen’s 5 attacks eliminated 1/5ths of its HP. After the fifth attack, the red light once more appeared at the hell spider’s abdomen. The new spider core already generated, the hell spider regained its ability to move. But, having its weakness found by Ling Chen, also already determined that it was not too far away from death.</p>
<p>The hell spider that recovered its movement swung its head, furiously releasing a big move… spraying a large amount of poisonous fluid forward, Ling Chen’s lips twitched… Your uncle here is so close and you actually have the balls to use such a move, are you afraid that you’re dying too slowly!</p>
<p>The area for the poisonous spray is forwards, and after spraying, the hell spider’s body will appear 2 seconds of stiffness. Ling Chen easily shifts his position, going around behind the hell spider, also bypassing all of the poison, a series of attacks once again falling upon the red dot on its abdomen.</p>
<p>Crack!!</p>
<p>The newly generated spider core seems to be very fragile, or maybe it’s Ling Chen attack under his extreme strength addition is too strong. With only 3 strikes, he then once again heard the sound of something breaking, the hell spider also falling upon the ground like last time , its defense and dodge all dropping to 0. This time, Ling Chen naturally wouldn’t waste a moment of time, attacks like a fierce wind falling upon its body.</p>
<p>-133, -135, -135, -139, -134, -270!</p>
<p>6 attacks, making the hell spider’s HP decrease almost by a quarter, only half of it HP remaining.</p>
<p>It seems that each time after the spider core regenerates, it becomes even more fragile. Once again, Ling Chen used only two attacks, destroying the spider core again before the hell spider can even start to attack, and then proceeding with another round of abuse.</p>
<p>In the virtual game world, some BOSS possess or big, or small weak points. If one can find its weak point, it will be a lot easier and simpler to win. Although, BOSS with weak points are only a minority, even if a BOSS has one, it isn’t that easy to find.</p>
<p>When the hell spider’s spider core broke for the 5 time, under another series of attacks from Ling Chen, its HP finally emptied, retracting its 8 legs, powerlessly falling onto the ground. The gray glow around its body quickly dissipating like smoke, dark green eyes also losing all light.</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully killed ‘Hell Spider’, Fame+50, SP+50.”</p>
<p>“DING… You have successfully exterminated ‘‘Hell Spider’, the door towards the fifth area of the Forgotten Cave has been opened.”</p>
<p>The same stone door, slowly opened before Ling Chen.</p>
<p>The death of a Lord BOSS will be accompanied by a fabulous explosion, this hell spider is also no exception, its body surrounded by a group of items, Ling Chen picked them up one by one.</p>
<p>5 gold coins, 3 silver coins, 4 red potions,, 2 orange potions, 3 blue potions.</p>
<p>A total of 2 pieces of equipment, one bronze coloured, the other, releasing a silver aura.</p>
<p>Could it be a silver equipment? Ling Chen felt unrestful in his heart. At the Novice Village stage, the possibility of silver equipment appearing is small enough to basically ignore. And the moment it appears, it will become a cheat-like existence.</p>
<p>[Mind Saber]: Type: Two Hand Sword, Grade: Silver, Equipment Requirements: Strength value greater than or equal to 35, LV5 or above, warrior type class. A light saber forged from silver, its light, silver aura can make the user’s heart still as water. Attributes: Attack+22, Strength+4, Hit Rate+4, immune to “Confused” condition. (TL: Realistically, I think a weapon made of silver would completely blow. Also lightweight saber, not lightsaber.)</p>
<p>It really is a silver equipment! Ling Chen’s heart was thrilled. Truly worthy of silver equipment, the Mind Saber’s stats completely surpasses the same level Wolf Fang Sword, and its length is longer than the Wolf Fang Sword’s, able to attack from a further distance.</p>
<p>Switching the Wolf Fang Sword, Ling Chen’s stats once again increase, he once again rejoiced at his extreme strength addition. If all the initial stat points didn’t go towards strength, all the gained AP also going towards strength, the 35 strength requirement would make him unable to equip the Mind Saber. The Mind Saber not only adds even more attack and stats, it also has an “Immune to Confusion” attribute, but he didn’t pay much attention to this attribute at the moment, because at the Novice Village stage, “Confusion” this kind of abnormal status basically will not appear. But, what he didn’t expect is, during the difficult battle where he is constantly walking along the edge of death in the fifth area, this attribute became his light of hope that he has to closely hold on to.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hello guys this is [R.E.A.D.E.R], and here is another quotes from our Savior Hikigaya Hachiman :</p>
<p>” Little sisters are strange indeed. No matter how cute they are, you just can’t feel anything for them. When I see her underwear, I just think, “Yep, that’s 100% cotton.” – Hikigaya Hachiman</p>
<p>That’s what real little sisters are like.</p>
<p>Sylver: Sorry about that, I thought May only had 30 days.</p>
<p>After equipping [Mind Saber], his physical attack reached 98 and his hit rate rose to 17. This kind of damage and hit rate is abnormal among Apprentice Warriors at the same level. If people saw Ling Chen holding that sword, it would lead to a large group of players attacking him in a frenzy trying to rob him.</p>
<p>The other piece of equipment is a novice Assassin’s light leggings, Bronze level, but it’s no use to Ling Chen, he casted a glance and put it away. Afterwards he observes and wonders what the other things are.</p>
<p>[Poisonous pedipalp] : the pedipalp of the poisonous spider, can be used in forging, granting the forged weapon the “poison” attributes. (Sylver: Pedipalps)</p>
<p>There are eight Poisonous pedipalps. And the last thing, is what looks like a transparent bottle, inside there is a thick green liquid swaying slowly along his movement.</p>
<p>[Hell spider saliva]: obtained from the poisonous spider, is extremely toxic, once contaminated, unless your power is above Fairy class, otherwise anyone getting infected will lose instantly 3o% of health. After leaving the hell spider body, the saliva toxicity will gradually dissipate, after 24h will lose all of it toxicity.</p>
<p>Ling Chen hand’s shook violently, almost throwing the bottle to the ground. But soon, he handles it carefully, the liquid inside the bottle is the poisonous spider saliva, Ling Chen feel fear in his heart. The liquid is dangerous but he also understand that it has a really amazing effect ,if he can use effectively and throw it at the body of any BOSS Fairy grade or below, he can take away 30% of their life.</p>
<p>Carefully put it away, Ling Chen subconsciously shook his hand, to prevent being contaminated. Then move towards the fifth area. The rear is completely sealed, he have to advance forwards.</p>
<p>Advancing to the rock gates, just one step from the fifth area, but suddenly, his whole body shock violently. ( [R.E.A.D.E.R]: Vi Britannia ORDER you: play this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL2lHvf75gA )</p>
<p>Slowly, Ling Chen retracted his foot, and took a step back, he stared at the stone gate, and don’t move for a long time (Sylver: A common way to say a long time or to exaggerate time is half a day).</p>
<p>The reason is, as he was about to enter the stone gate, he feel an extreme sense of danger (TL: his spider’s sense is tingling…). That feeling is not a mistake, for many times in his life; this warning has saved his life many times, it has never failed him. This sense of danger tells him, right before him, there is a powerful enemy…so powerful that he is helpless in front of it! As soon as he entered, he will be easily crushed into pieces, without any mean to resist let alone fight it! (TL:yes he is about to meet his worst nightmare called EXAM!!!)</p>
<p>A second passed, after a full ten minutes, Ling Chen stood still. He tried to enter several times, but each time he makes a move, a terrible wave of danger surges, so he can’t move forward. What is inside; what is hidden in the cave? Could it be ten, and even more advanced lord Boss?</p>
<p>His sense of danger warns him to not enter, there is only a dead end (TL: ho? did you activate Ruo Ruo yandere route?), even if he had 10 lives he would still die. However, his retreat route is completely blocked, except advancing, he have no other options.</p>
<p>Half-hour passed, Ling Chen is still standing here. Behind the stone door, there is a deep darkness, perhaps once entered, he will fall and with the result is dying.(TL: yeeahh, after killing more than 2k of monster he died…from a pitfall……)</p>
<p>Time passed, and noon arrives. Ling Chen in the end did not advance, but took a few steps back and looked at the time, and then log out of the game.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, he sees Shui Ruo attractive body, her beautiful eyes make the stars looks pale in comparison, seeing him opening his eyes, touching his cheeks with her hand pursed a smile, and sweetly said: “Brother.” (TL: [R.E.A.D.E.R] received critical damage, [R.E.A.D.E.R] has fainted).</p>
<p>Ling Chen stands up,Carrying Shui Fruo from the wheelchair, putting her on his knee, he scolded her: “I told you to not move around, what if you fall?”</p>
<p>“Hee, I will not fall. I want to observe brother. Brother looks while playing the game seriously, is very good looking.” Ling Shui Ruo takes advantage and use his arm to embrace her. In his arms, she gently twist her body, on the white smooth wrist she also wears a gaming device, she was waiting every day to get better, so she can enter the game with Ling Chen, secretly helping him to do some things.</p>
<p>Ever since that day she took the dose of the 13223 drug, Ling Shui Ruo’s smile became brighter and more beautiful, a day before she was desperate and have no hope with a dark future the promise with Ling Chen was the only reason why she could struggle for so long. For Ling Chen, in order to realize that wonderful dream, but the commitment has been out of reach, she is using her all to fight, but, she also knows herself she can’t struggle for long, thinking there is no future in, leaving Ling Chen living alone by himself, every day, her heart is in pain. But now God gave her a chance to be reborn, she believed in Ling Chen, believing the drug will save her, the depressing feeling disappeared, leaving a bright and pure sky in her heart. She knew after being reborn what to do, she will use all the time remaining in her life, to accompany the young man even in desperate times…… No matter what, even if the whole world hates him, and rejected him, she will not. (TL:Damn you onion ninja, DAMN YOU!!!)</p>
<p>Ling Chen put his arm around her waist and the other hand holding her light gaming device, he smiled and said: “In a few days when the body is completely better, I will take you along in the game world, I believe Ruo will like it a lot.”</p>
<p>“Mmm !! I am certain that day will arrive soon …… Yes, brother, do not forget this afternoon.” While leaning on his shoulder Shui Ruo, said softly. On her cheek, a faint color red can be seen.</p>
<p>“Haha, of course, I will not forget.”</p>
<p>(TL: those with dirty though, I the great Reader order you, dance, jump, do squats AND commit suicide)</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo’s body is weak, her body can only a little of normal action for every day, although Ling Chen often takes her to feel the morning breeze and helping her to walking slowly, but the amount is not enough for the human body. To prevent Shui Ruo’s body from declining and become rigid, he needs to exercise the body and do some stretching and muscle massage, every seven days, he spends an afternoon time, he applies a strange massage technique that ordinary people do not know on every part of Shui Ruo body … Under his efforts, with Shui Ruo illness during three years, and spend the majority of her time in bed, but her skin is still white, like a baby, slim and delicate curve, every part of the body is perfect can’t find the slightest flaws.</p>
<p>Ling Chen often sweat a lot and collapse after every massage. Ling Shui Ruo although distressed, but she never try to stop him, but take the initiative to remind him every week. Because she does not want her body to becomes imperfect … … Only a perfect body, can match up with him.</p>
<p>In the afternoon,…</p>
<p>The warm sunlight passed through the light blue curtains, shining on the two snuggling bodies. Ling Chen placed Ling Shui Ruo on the soft bed, lying upwards, he extended his hand, one by one undoing the buttons in front of her chest and the belt at her waist. Slowly taking off the white dress. The hot summer season, Shui Ruo only wears a dress at home. Her slim legs and delicate arms like jade being exposed to the air after taking off the dress. Her entire body was only covered with pink underwear that barely covered her body, but was unable to hide her full, abundant, creamy jade-like breasts, An intoxiacting scene in sight.</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo’s flawless skin white and soft, smooth as jade. That is not the pale white of a sick person, but a milky white as if rubbed with a layer of cream. Slim, elegant legs especially seductive, her fine, smooth thighs white and soft almost to the point of being transparent, moving uniformly with her curvaceous, tight, soft narrow waist. Ling Chen’s hands lightly caressed her legs, almost uncontrollably wanting to extend his hand downwards, towards her exposed feet so soft as if they had no bones. (Sylver: Foot Fetish?) (Reader: nah, siscon)</p>
<p>Every inch of her skin had the charm to make people mesmerized, especially that pair of breasts that can just barely be grasped with a hand. So full, soft, smooth, perky, tightly pushing against the bra. 16 years old, is the age for growth, the bras that Ling Chen buys for her would always grow tighter after a period of time.</p>
<p>Need to buy new bras again for her, Ling Chen silently sighed with feeling, extending his hand and familiarly undoing the stopper at the back. A section of dazzling whiteness lightly popping out, the small, pink pearl at the tips also lightly bouncing with it, making Ling Chen dazed. Shui Ruo’s body, has always been the most beautiful scene he has seen in his life.</p>
<p>The bra slowly slid down her silky skin, that pair of soft breasts as smooth as jade like a pair of blossoming flower buds, shaking and trembling in a section of snow-white translucent skin. Her thin, soft and tender waist giving people the feeling of wanting to embrace her and gently take care of her. Her body soft and translucent like a jade carving presenting itself completely naked in front of Ling Chen, warm sunlight falling upon her body, painting an unimaginably beautiful scene…</p>
<p>“Brother, do I look good?” Ling Shui Ruo’s beautiful eyes slightly squinted. She did not cover her body, instead opening her arms, allowing Ling Chen to see even more clearly, she understands the enchantment of her body. That year the first time she revealed her body in front of him, she clearly remembers the always calm brother immediately went blank. and had a big nose bleed… That also became the biggest embarrassment of Ling Chen’s life. Ling Chen did not respond to her voice, his eyes like many times before becoming mesmerized. Shui Ruo smiled lightly, her pure and beautiful face appearing slightly flirtatious, she brought her lips close, sticking out her tongue, lightly licking the side of his ear.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s entire body numbed, his body slightly shuddering. In his vision, is still Shui Ruo’s body beautiful to the point of perfection. Her perky, shaking breasts, thin, waist soft as if having no bones, her smooth, round butt, silky, flat stomach, elegant legs, paired with her even though young, but already unmatchable, beautiful face, along with her fae like aura of dreamlike purity. Truly no part of her body is not beautiful, every single part of her body enough to drive men crazy.</p>
<p>Ling Chen took a deep breath, difficulty closing his eyes: “Shui Ruo, don’t mess around, or else… I really will eat you.” (Sylver: I don’t think I need to explain what he means by eat. If not… he means sex)</p>
<p>“Hi (laugh), I’m not afraid, I’m brother’s in the first place… belonging only to brother forever.” Ling Shui Ruo not only didn’t back down, instead extending her arms wrapping around his neck, laughing beautifully.</p>
<p>Actually, every week at this time, is always the most painful moment for Ling Chen. His strong willpower withstanding the most difficult test. If Shui Ruo’s body was fine, he’d already taken her. But, her currently weak body cannot endure any sort of ravaging. Every time, he can only forcibly close his eyes, working hard to clear the dirty thoughts in his mind, and then using his hands, from top to bottom, from in front to behind, massage her entire body inch by inch…</p>
<p>’tis me. So [R.E.A.D.E.R] translated most of this chapter and I just translated that small bit at the end. I have to say, that was damn hard for me. The Chinese have like a million ways of describing one part of the body that sometimes doesn’t even translate to english. I can imagine that Chinese erotica pwn fifty shades of grey, though that’s probably not a good comparison. Another to add to the list of things I’m never going to translate, Chinese Erotica. Also, it probably doesn’t flow that well and grammar is probably really off. Can’t do much about that. Post suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It is I [Reader] again, this time instead of a H.H quotes, I took someone else:</p>
<p>10pts for the one who find it first:</p>
<p>“‘Common sense’? Worthless things like those, I haven’t had for as long as I can remember!”</p>
<p>Chapter 25: The Behemoth in the Chasm</p>
<p>Two hands touching Shui Ruo’s tender skin, the fingers slightly folded, an invisible force entering her body, from outside to inside, making her body feel relaxed.</p>
<p>When everything is over, the outside light is dimmed, it’s already evening, Ling Chen’s clothes has been completely soaked in sweat, he withdraws his hands, letting a long sigh of relief out. He checked if Shui Ruo is asleep, he let out a small smile, she is sleeping peacefully. Ling Chen put a blanket over her body, walking lightly opening the door and walking out.</p>
<p>After closing the door Ling Chen started panting without holding back , he leaned back at the wall and couldn’t move. Every time after massaging Shui Ruo, he is completely exhausted, that is not simply a massage. Shui Ruo survival until now is deeply linked with this technique.</p>
<p>He stretched out his hands, silently looking at the red point in his palm, Ling Chen eyes narrowed, in a low voice murmured to himself: “HELL, back then, I hated you, I wanted to cut you into thousandth piece. But now it seems that I need to thank you…… At least without you…… I would have died 10 years ago…….”</p>
<p>“Died from Isrock……”</p>
<p>Ling Chen exhausted all his strength; he fell asleep for many hours and woke up late, going outside in a hurry to buy food, afraid that Shui Ruo will be hungry. He was busy a long time, outside night has already fallen, bathing Shui Ruo, putting her into the bed, and soon Shui Ruo fell asleep, her face is filled with smiles, thinking about her happy future.</p>
<p>After Shui Ruo slept, Ling Chen adjusts his posture and enters Mystic Moon.</p>
<p>“DING … Welcome back to 《Mystic Moon》, we wish you a happy experience.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen appears to his previous place, in ‘The forgotten cave’ fourth area, in front of the stone door towards the fifth area.</p>
<p>He took a step forwards, before entering the fifth area, the sudden sense of danger surging again, this time, Ling Chen grinded his teeth, examining his current status and item, after he stepped forward. There is only one way, no matter how long he hesitates it’s just a waste of time, he can only advance and take it head on.</p>
<p>Rumble……</p>
<p>After entering the fifth area, behind him the stone door, a sense of extremely dangerous atmosphere sweeping past Ling Chen’s body and mind. He looked attentively at the front, this room is the same size as the areas from before, a circular place about 50 meter, the only difference from before, at the center there is a 7 or 8 meter black and green in an irregular shape.</p>
<p>Croak……</p>
<p>Croak……</p>
<p>The moment when the stone door closed, something else was awakened, a weird and horrible cry entered in the ears of the Ling Chen, the source……</p>
<p>Is the huge object ahead.</p>
<p>Croak……</p>
<p>Croak……</p>
<p>Croak!!!!</p>
<p>A deep and dreary sound, the black mass wriggled slowly, then all of a sudden jumping high, Ling Chen unconsciously took a step back, looking up, his eyes contracted and focused on the monster, he saw two huge claws extended, the claws are covered by lumps, the dead is covered by skin. As it falls from the air, a ugly body stands in front of Ling Chen, two big eyes look down and emit ferocious and chilling killing intent.</p>
<p>This is a toad……. A green black giant toad, as huge as a hill looks on Ling Chen.!!</p>
<p>[Greedy giant toad]: Type: Beast, Level: 10, HP : ? ? ? ? ? Description: Unidentified huge toad.</p>
<p>Upon observing the stats of the huge toad appearing in front of him, he inhales a deep breath.</p>
<p>The huge toad is actually …… a level 1o fairie!!</p>
<p>No wonder there is such intense danger warning sign before entering here. He never thought he could meet a lvl 10 fairy grade behind the stone door. A fairy grade, an existence above the Lord Boss. There is only one different rank between a Lord Boss and a Fairy (TL: toad=fairy so strange), but their strength are far apart. A Lord Boss is strong, but as long as the players have sufficient personnel and adequate equipment with correct coordination between them they can win, However, a Fairy Boss at the same level is impossible for the players to win. To overcome a level 10 fairy monster, even 1000 of level 10 players combined may not have a chance of success. A level 50 fairy Boss needs a high amount of players with lvl 100 if they hope to succeed. Fighting alone is simply fantasy. Especially in the starting phase, classes, skills, attributes are not complete it’s impossible for new players to fight against a Fairy Boss. At the same time, fairy Boss also does not appear near a novice village.</p>
<p>But in front of Ling Chen, there is a real Fairy Boss! (TL: Must be his luck stats)</p>
<p>Stepping back, Ling Chen can only think of four words, can not be beat. A level 10 Fairy Boss…How can a Fairy boss appear near (TL: if you don’t add the 3.36km fall) the novice village! (TL: no dude you were supposed to lvl up more and receive some quest…. you took a shortcut….). This is simply contrary to common sense!(TL: like hell you have common sense!!!) Such a monster, even with his full stats in strength, silver weapon in hand, is still an impossible task to break the defense. A Fairy Boss has plenty of skills and powerful attacks, he can’t deal with them like he did against the normal, elite or lord boss monster.</p>
<p>Croak…..</p>
<p>Croak……</p>
<p>Croak!!!!</p>
<p>At every muffled cry, Ling Chen’s heart beats faster, and finally, the toad didn’t remain peaceful, he leaps violently, throwing himself towards Ling Chen. The Greedy Giant Toad has a great size, but its jumping ability is, he jumped for more than 20 meters, falling directly toward to the location with Ling Chen at the center, a body as big as a hill is falling down. (TL: http://i.imgur.com/rqQIDHm.png)</p>
<p>Ling Chen used his maximum speed, running to the other side of the Giant Greedy Toad… he tried his best, by observing the shadow on the ground, the toad is falling closer and closer, although he escaped outside the falling point, but upon landing the aftershock will still hit him…the attack range is too big!</p>
<p>No choice!!!</p>
<p>In a flash, he gulped down a bottle of potion.</p>
<p>“Ding… You used [Wang Ji’s Special Speed Potion]: movement speed+20, lasts 1 hour.</p>
<p>Booom!!!</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad body fall heavily, the entire ground shook the ground was shaking, Ling Chen almost stumbles and falls on the floor, he had no time to think about, he didn’t dare to stop, with great efforts he stabilized the body, and running further away from the giant toad. He clearly feels the greedy giant toad upon landing, used his huge claws, missed a few centimeters away from his back.</p>
<p>If he had not taken the potion, he would be trampled under the claw.</p>
<p>He ran away on the opposite side of the giant toad, Ling Chen pants heavily, his forehead is covered in a cold sweat, firmly clenched the sword on his hands.</p>
<p>In front of a Fairy Boss… what could he do?</p>
<p>Escape? There is no way forward, the door is closed, where can he escape? Defeat it? A level 5, at the novice training stage, killing a Fairy Boss! Give up, get killed and go back to the novice village!?</p>
<p>Isrock was not able to take my life…</p>
<p>In that place even more terrible than hell, they died one by one……. I am the only one alive…… Even that place, did not take away my life, it couldn’t destroy my will…</p>
<p>Even the one called “the most terifying man on Earth” died by my hand …</p>
<p>There is nothing, that could me make me give up and die!!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen eyes gradually becomes cold, he turns around and faced the toad, he raised his sword slowly…</p>
<p>Even the most desperate situation, didn’t take my life away…An ugly toad, doesn’t have the right to kill me!!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen takes out a white scroll, face it towards the Giant Toad…that was a scroll given by the village chef, [Scan Scroll] it’s a scroll to scan the information of monsters. (TL: Don’t know when he got it? read ch9). (what about his scan skill allow him to see the monster 10lvl higher right? why not use it? )</p>
<p>[Greedy Giant Toad] : Type: Beast, Level: 10, Grade: Fairie, HP: 8oooo, a descendant of an ancient clan of toads, that should have gone extinct a long time ago. Not knowing when it appeared in the abyss, but it never left the place, it seems to be guarding something. His body is heavily corrupted, has a strong defense and earth attribute abilities.</p>
<p>Passive skills: 60% earth Resistance, high physical defense, confusion, poison, petrification immunity</p>
<p>Attack:</p>
<p>[Leap]: a high jump, its great body leaps towards the enemy, it will cause a shockwave in a small range, can cause dizziness and make a falling, usage frequency: high.</p>
<p>[Piercing tongue]: suddenly spit out its giant tongue piercing all targets in front of it, the range is 12×1 and fast, and can attack without warning, is extremely difficult to escape. Usage Frequency: very high.</p>
<p>Stone throw]: throw a huge boulder to the target, the boulder after landing will explode, the explosion range will cover 5×5 from the landing point. usage frequency: Medium.</p>
<p>[Stone Hail]: Jumping up high and causing the ground to tremor, making all targets within a 20 meter radius lose balance, and then using earth element to call down rocks in a 20 meter radius around its body, the rocks have a chance to daze. The concentration of the falling rocks is very high, very hard to dodge. After activating, will enter a rigid state for 3 seconds, Usage Frequency: Med -Low.</p>
<p>[Avarice Sonic Wave]: Releasing dangerous infrasonic waves that interfere with the target’s mind, making all targets within a 50 meter radius 100% fall into a confused condition for at least 5 seconds. Usage Frequency: Low.</p>
<p>[Earth Split]: Using all of the earth element within its body to assault the ground, causing all of the earth element within a 30 meter radius to go ballistic, attacking all targets indiscriminately, also with a chance to stun, no openings to dodge within the enveloped area, after activating body enters a rigid condition for at least 8 seconds, defense decreasing to 0 for 30 seconds, also unable to use earth element for 30 seconds. Usage Frequency: Activates when HP is below 10%, can only use once a day.</p>
<p>Weakness: Wind Attribute Resistance 30%, the defense at its head is relatively weaker.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After using the [Scan Scroll], every information about the greedy giant toad appeared in front of Ling Chen, it also told him how powerful a Fairy Boss is. The Boss is only level 10 but it already has 6 powerful abilities. If he didn’t used the scan scroll to learn the skills and weakness of the giant toad, he would succumb faster under the giant toad attack.(TL: Lucky for you huh Sylver, it’s not a spider)</p>
<p>“Ding… You used [Wang Ji’s Special Strength Potion]: physical attack strength+20, lasts 1 hour.</p>
<p>“Ding… You used [Wang Ji’s Special Hit Potion]: hit rate+20, lasts 1 hour.</p>
<p>Fighting alone against the Greedy Giant Toad, he didn’t see many ways to win, Ling Chen didn’t have any hesitation, he immediately used the precious Strength and Hit potions. Magic potion has no use to him, as for the Health potion even with an additional 200 HP when one hit can instant- kill him, using it is simply a waste.</p>
<p>After using the strength, hit and speed potion, Ling Chen’s attack rose to 118, hits rate reach 37, and movement speed reaches 120%, his stats has reached their full potential, He raised his weapon and looks in front of him. The giant toad makes a high leap, the body lands heavily on the ground, there is only 10 meters separating them. Ling Chen inhales deeply, he slowly takes out a bottle with green liquid…</p>
<p>In the skill attribute, it shows that the toad is immune to poison. After all, inside the toad there is many kind of poison, being immune is natural. But, the hell spider saliva is different; the potency is on a higher level, its description clearly said “unless the power is above Fairy class, otherwise anyone getting infected will lose instantly 3o% of health”, it takes away 30% of health directly, instead of losing health little by little. It means the toads immunity towards the Hell Spider saliva is ineffective.</p>
<p>But unfortunately a long time has passed the saliva effect will be less effective, when he first took the hell Spider saliva, if he wasn’t concerned about Ling Shui Ruo, he will certainly choose the risk to enter the fifth area and face the formidable foes and use the hell Spider saliva immediately to achieve maximum effect, but in the end, he choose Shui Ruo(TL:me too!!), after all, to defeat the enemy takes a long time, it would make him unable to take to care of Shui Ruo on time. By now, the hell spider saliva effect have decreased, it may not take 30% of health. While it still has some effect, it is best to use it now…</p>
<p>But will it be really easy?</p>
<p>Croaa!!</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad, huge as a hill, leapt towards him, Ling Chen was prepared and with his 120% of increase in speed he easily escaped to the side, and before falling, he rolled his body to avoid falling from the shockwaves. He did not leave, after standing up, he took out the hell spider saliva from his bag.</p>
<p>He didn’t forget about the Giant Toad strongest skill – Earth Split, it’s an indiscriminate skill that can cover the surrounding 30 meters The total length of this space is only 50 meters. If the Greedy Giant Toad activates the skill in a center location, it will cover the entire location. The indiscriminate attack will cause him to have no chance of evading. At that time, what greets him will only be death.</p>
<p>However, this skill will only be released when its HP falls below 10%. As long as his health doesn’t decrease fewer than 10%, it will not have the opportunity to release this skill!!</p>
<p>He hopes that he can hold until the health reaches that limit!</p>
<p>He also hopes that the spider saliva can take the 10% of HP!</p>
<p>That is a gamble!</p>
<p>He bet on his pride, he made a gamble with everything…… He will do his best!! Even if the enemy in front of him is 10 times stronger, he must fight and not die!!</p>
<p>He cannot die!!</p>
<p>The huge shadow falls from the sky again. Before jumping, the Giant Toad will crouch his legs, at that time Ling Chen starts to retreat, as long he is focused, with his 120 speed he can avoid it easily…if he reacts slowly, he will die under the Giant Toad’s Body.</p>
<p>Boom!!</p>
<p>The giant toad fall heavily to the ground once more. This time, Ling Chen did not run away, but hastily ran back, attacking the giant toad’s body three times.</p>
<p>-1,-1, miss</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “……”</p>
<p>His physical attack rose by 20 points and with the bulky body of the giant toad, it couldn’t avoid, letting his three attack hit two times.. But the two hit, unable to break the minimum defense…. Only did ‘1’ damage.</p>
<p>Level 5 with full strength, a silver ranked sword in hand, took a special potion that can increase 20 physical attack. And still unable to break the defense of the Greedy Giant Toad!</p>
<p>If he can’t break its defense, then what does he need to beat it!?</p>
<p>Ling Chen hearts sank, falling back after the attack, the giant toad moved to a safe location, preparing for his next attack. His eyes observe the greedy giant toad back legs, [Leap], one of the attacks the giant greedy toad will use often… but this time, he didn’t see the legs crouching down. Ling Chen frowned his eyebrows, he suddenly saw the giant greedy giant clam open slightly his mouth, without thinking, his right leg pushed the ground, quickly evading to the left.</p>
<p>Whoosh!!</p>
<p>The tongue of the Giant Toad shot out like an arrow, piercing the place where Ling Chen was standing previously, the piercing tongue is about a dozen meter – and have 1m width. After hitting the ground it stopped for an instant, it rolled back its tongue, after escaping a narrow death, Ling Chen let out a cold sweat. If he didn’t know about the [Piercing Tongue], he would be hit by the surprise attack.</p>
<p>Seeing the [Piercing Tongue] failed, the giant toad crouched his back leg, leaping towards him. Ling Chen swiftly escapes, then quickly turned back, attacking the Toad body three times.</p>
<p>-1,-1, miss.</p>
<p>Without surprise, his attack couldn’t surpass the defense, unless he got a lucky 5% piercing rate, otherwise normal attacks only cause 1 damage.</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad is weak to wind element attack…… Ling Chen is not a mage, so naturally he can’t do any wind related attack. The other weakness is the weak defense on the head.</p>
<p>The head……</p>
<p>The body of the greedy giant toad is at least seven or eight meters high, the player’s initial maximum jump height of 1 meters, Ling Chen can’t reach the head.</p>
<p>What to do?… Relying on the 5% piercing rate? Even if he can rely on the 5% piercing rate, how many months it would take him to empty the 80000 HP?</p>
<p>Although his perception, reaction, judgment ability and agility are abnormal, however, in front of the Greedy Giant Toad, he must stay focused every second, if he is distracted or makes an error in judgment, he will die. In this state, every time minutes pass his mental fatigue increases, he can’t hold that long. Mental fatigue is worse than physical fatigue. Physical fatigue can recover with little time, but mental fatigue can’t be restored with such short time.</p>
<p>The Greedy giant toad opened his mouth and something squirming outside, Ling Chen’s body react instantly, he made a sideways roll, the wind sound entered his ears. The giant white tongue of the toad shot down, brushing past Ling Chen, hitting the place where he was before, he recovered his stance quickly. At that moment, he caught a glimpse at the tongue touch the ground… The giant greedy toad tongue is different from normal toad, this one is not sticky.</p>
<p>Croooaa!</p>
<p>Crooooaaaa!!</p>
<p>After recovering its tongue, the tongue held high his two front hands, a mass of dark yellow light appearing, the toad hold a large rock of 2 meters in his hands, letting out a strange sound, he threw it towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Bang!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen make a jump backwards, the rock falling in front of him, then suddenly exploding into 10 smaller pieces, 3 pieces flew towards him. If he didn’t know about [Stone throw] effect, he would be taken by surprise, but he was prepared, he observed flying path of the rocks, with two small movements, the 3 rocks all missed.</p>
<p>Croooaa!</p>
<p>Crooooaaaa!!</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The toad tongue shot out once again, without any warning, a speed faster than an arrow is the worst nightmare for any players, people that can avoid like Ling Chen, there are very few of them in the whole world.</p>
<p>This time, the tongue didn’t touch Ling Chen, just like the previous time, it only hit the ground. After avoiding, Ling Chen’s eyes gleamed, just a moment before the toad recovers its tongue, Ling Chen suddenly jumped and grabs the tongue.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The toad recovers its tongue quickly, grabbing Ling Chen into its mouth. But just before falling into the toad mouth, with the help of the momentum he redirected himself; he landed on the toad’s head and used his sword to attack.</p>
<p>Miss, -34!</p>
<p>The toad body shook violently, Ling Chen is ruthlessly thrown on the ground, standing up Ling Chen looks at the disappearing damage on the toad’s head, and let out a smile.</p>
<p>The damage is small…but it let him see a spark of hope.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Fake people have an image to maintain. Real people just don’t care.” – Hikigaya Hachiman</p>
<p>Btw, if you guys want, I can start doing a teaser thing for the next chapter. I’m not going to do a poll so just leave a comment.</p>
<p>-30,</p>
<p>Being thrown at the ground Ling Chen lost a little HP, he did a roll upon landing on the ground steadying himself. Gripping Mind Saber in both hands and tightly clenching. The saber that struck its head dealing “34” damage. The Greedy Giant Toad’s head having slightly lower defense is only relative to the rest of its body, Ling Chen’s basic attack of 118 only dealt 34 damage, being reduced by nearly one quarter…. but as long as he can penetrate its defense, then there is hope!!</p>
<p>Then, the only possibility of defeating it, is at every moment it spits out its tongue, instantly stepping on the giant tongue after dodging, allowing the tongue to bring him towards the head and attacking…</p>
<p>This is the only possibility… also making it impossible for regular players to accomplish. Dodging the attack of the barbed tongue is already incredibly difficult. Jumping onto the tongue right after dodging, jumping onto its head the moment before the tongue is completely retracted… Among the process, if there is even a sliver of error, then he will be directly swallowed into the Greedy Giant Toad’s mouth or falling off, being trampled by the toad.</p>
<p>And it is exactly this attack strategy that normal players cannot even dream of accomplishing, that has become Ling Chen’s only chance of winning.</p>
<p>FWOOSH!!</p>
<p>The terrifying barbed tongue shooting out like an arrow, Ling Chen’s eyes narrowed into a thin slit, the barbed tongue shooting towards him as if suddenly becoming a lot slower in his eyes, its trajectory clearly visible to him…</p>
<p>Jumping back to the side, the Greedy Giant Toad’s tongue tapping on the ground in front of him, only a hair’s width away from the tip of his toe. At the short moment that the barbed tongue pauses, his body that had just touched the ground rapidly leaps forward, steadily landing on top of the tongue, firmly controlling his body’s balance, and then charging towards the giant toad’s head following the retraction of the tongue.</p>
<p>From that terrifying mouth is only the difference of one step, at this instant Ling Chen jumps upwards, landing precisely above the giant toad’s mouth, but not immediately attacking like last time, instead taking another step forward. jumping between its eyes, lifting Mind Saber, “Full Power Strike” cutting downwards.</p>
<p>-50, -51, MISS…</p>
<p>Standing at the position between the Greedy Giant Toad’s eyes, with the obstacle of the left and right eyes, he rapidly attacked 3 times before being thrown off by the giant toad.</p>
<p>Landing on the ground Ling Chen once more lost some HP. He steadied his body, lifting his head, the corners of his lips forming a cold smile… Just like this, I will point by point send you down to hell!!</p>
<p>My body, my spirit, my will… you have to persist!!</p>
<p>I cannot die here!!</p>
<p>Croak!!!</p>
<p>Even though the damage dealt by Ling Chen’s two attack couldn’t even be considered a scratch, it already made it enraged. Big green eyes releasing an even more violent light, its body pausing, two massive hind legs abruptly kicking at the ground…</p>
<p>At this moment Ling Chen’s body subconsciously made a dodging movement, but, in the next moment, the Greedy Giant Toad’s shadow did not fall towards him, instead jumping highly on the spot, and then landing heavily back onto the ground.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes tightly locked onto the giant toad’s falling body, one of its scariest skills flashing across his mind — Stone Hail.</p>
<p>Right at the moment before the Greedy Giant Toad’s body is about to land on the ground, Ling Chen jumps up high.</p>
<p>SMASH!!</p>
<p>A heavy sound, the entire area starting to violently shake. The gravel and dust on the surrounding walls streaming downwards. When Ling Chen landed on the ground, the ground was still trembling, making him almost unable to stand steadily. If he hadn’t jumped up on time, this attack would be more than enough to make him lose balance and fall down, even become dazed. Doing his best to maintain his balance, Ling Chen used all of his strength to escape backwards.</p>
<p>Croak!!</p>
<p>A thick yellow light started to flicker on the Greedy Giant Toad’s body. Under the continued trembling of the ground, countless broken stones from an unknown location, heavily smashed towards the ground from above, forming a screen of concentrated rock shower.</p>
<p>Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam Bam…</p>
<p>The disastrous rocks fell to the ground with a terrifying smash, completely enveloping Ling Chen’s body. Ling Chen did not lift his head, because the time required for him to lift his head is enough for him to be smashed by a couple falling rocks. He closed his eyes, listening to every sound of wind that approached his body, his body following the sound of the wind twisting his body at angles and positions that completely defied human physiology. Or high or low, or left or right, his entire body bringing up a ring of unclear afterimages…</p>
<p>Nobody could see clearly, in these two seconds, he continuously made 8 or big or small shifts in his position, and just like that charged out from a gap in the concentrated falling rocks, his body sticking to the wall at the very side… The range for Stone Hail envelops the 20 meter area around the Greedy Giant Toad. He successfully escaped, the moment his taut body relaxed, if he wasn’t leaning against the wall, he would have nearly fallen onto the ground.</p>
<p>Greedy Giant Toad has a total of 80 thousand HP. Up until now, he has dealt a total of not even 150 points of damage… And within this time period, he had already encountered many dangerous moments, many times only a thin line away from death.</p>
<p>Even so, he is not willing to give up. In his dictionary, the term“give up” does not exist.</p>
<p>After activating Stone Hail, the Greedy Giant Toad will enter a rigid condition for at least 3 seconds, but this rigid condition doesn’t matter towards Ling Chen even if it’s 10 times longer, because he can’t even pierce through the Greedy Giant Toad’s defense. This short period of time, he can only use it to adjust his mind, allowing his constantly tense nerves and mind to relax for a small moment.</p>
<p>Croak!!</p>
<p>The recovered giant toad with a “pounce”, fell towards Ling Chen’s position, and then with a “smash” sound bumping into the wall that Ling Chen was leaning on. Ling Chen made two long jumps, respectively avoiding the the giant toad’s pounce and the trembling of the ground. He then rapidly moved backwards, until his distance from the giant toad was exactly 10 meters… because he vaguely deduced that at this distance, the Greedy Giant Toad seems to readily use its barbed tongue.</p>
<p>FWOOSH!!</p>
<p>As he wished, the giant toad’s barbed tongue carrying a strong wind shot over. Ling Chen who was already prepared dodged and jumped, once again stepping on top of the massive tongue. Jumping onto the giant toad’s head with a sound of wind brought by the tongue, “Swish Swish Swish” 3 full power strikes.</p>
<p>MISS, MISS, -177!</p>
<p>Missing twice, the third time, an eye burning blue coloured damage, a pierce damage more than the total damage of Ling Chen’s previous attacks.</p>
<p>Under the high defense of the Greedy Giant Toad, the damage from a pierce attack is a lot more effective than a critical hit.</p>
<p>-23!</p>
<p>After 3 attacks, Ling Chen was heavily thrown off. He swiftly pulled apart the distance from the giant toad, and then swallowed a red potion recovering to full health. Tightening his forehead, quickly running around in a 10 meter radius of the giant toad, waiting for the next time of the barbed tongue’s arrival.</p>
<p>SMASH!</p>
<p>SMASH!!</p>
<p>SMASH!!</p>
<p>Pounce! Pounce! Pounce! Giant Rock Smash! Pounce! Pounce! Stone Hail…</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body travelled between a multitude of attacks that can easily insta-kill him, moving around, the sound of breathing becoming heavier and heavier, but from beginning to end his mind did not slack. His dignity, his will all did not permit him to fall here. It’s just, what made his heart start to shiver is, this Greedy Giant Toad seems to have become smarter… An entire two minutes, and it did not use its barbed tongue again once!</p>
<p>Fairie BOSS for the most part have a certain amount of intelligence, could it be that this giant toad already fully understands that Ling Chen only has a chance to hurt it when it releases its barbed tongue?</p>
<p>If it’s like that, then he really doesn’t have even an ounce of hope.</p>
<p>FWOOSH!!</p>
<p>Right when he started to get anxious, the giant barbed tongue suddenly shot towards him.</p>
<p>This abrupt attack that can make regular beings lose all hope instead made Ling Chen so excited that he almost tripped onto the ground while running. This barbed tongue is not just a simple attack, it also means that this giant toad’s intelligence is not completely mature. It still uses an almost mechanical form of attacking. Ling Chen just narrowly dodges it, jumping up again, charging towards the Greedy Giant Toads head.</p>
<p>-50, MISS, MISS…</p>
<p>The most commonly used attack for the the giant toad is pounce, after that is its barbed tongue, but, the giant toad’s limited intelligence makes the rate that it uses its barbed tongue noticeably lower. Sometimes using it 2,3 times within a minute, sometimes not even using it a single time for multiple minutes. All of Ling Chen attention is focused on the Greedy Giant Toad’s body, those precious moments, he would closely grab onto them each time, and then mercilessly strike the giant toad 3 times on the head…</p>
<p>-50, -50, MISS…</p>
<p>MISS, MISS, -49…</p>
<p>-102, MISS, -52…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>once, twice, three times… ten times, twenty times…</p>
<p>All of the pounce attacks are perfectly dodged by Ling Chen, the assaulting boulders and falling gravel not able to touch Ling Chen’s body a single time. The frequency of activating the large area Hail Stone is very low, an average of once every ten minutes. Every time, it would make Ling Chen step across the boundaries of death, but not a single time actually making him die…</p>
<p>The giant toad that would initially release its barbed tongue multiple times within a minute, at the end only released it three times in an average of two minutes.</p>
<p>And every time, Ling Chen would accurately grasp this opportunity, miraculously… or maybe it could be said as terrifyingly without any mistakes or oversights. At the same time every three attacks, every round would deal an average of 100 points of damage.</p>
<p>Under this kind of method the Greedy Giant Toad’s HP went down incredibly slowly… Half an hour, it lost 4000 HP, after another half an hour, its HP dropped down to 72000.</p>
<p>As for Ling Chen, besides the life lost from being thrown off, from beginning to end did not get touched by the Greedy Giant Toad’s body or attacks once.</p>
<p>One hour, slicing off 8000 of the Breedy Giant Toad’s HP…</p>
<p>If things can continue like this… 10 hours… he only needs to persist for another 9 hours…</p>
<p>Maybe, he can really defeat it!!</p>
<p>Once again dangerously escaping from the falling rock rain, Ling Chen was already sweating bullets. He half crouched on the ground, taking advantage of the giant toad’s temporary rigid status and taking large breaths.</p>
<p>One hour, from the very beginning his heart strings have been in a very taut condition, this kind of mental exhaustion had already surpassed a regular human’s limits. That he can endure until now, it is already enough to make people unable to believe it. Regular people under this kind of high mental concentration condition wouldn’t be able to last for 10 minutes before feeling dizzy, their entire body weak, wishing they could just fall down and sleep.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s mind is already so exhausted that he wishes he could take a nice, long nap, but if he really wants to defeat the Greedy Giant Toad, under the condition that no other incidents or variables occur, he still needs to endure for 9 more hours… These nine hours, if his concentration slacks for even a second, we will die…</p>
<p>9 hours…</p>
<p>Can I really endure… Ling Chen lowered his head, quietly watching his palm slowly clench.</p>
<p>Ruo Ruo… please give be belief and strength!!</p>
<p>The constant struggles with you at the edge of death, time and time again beating the god of death… this bit of mental exhaustion is nothing!!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“There are some people who don’t want a solution. Some want things to stay the way they are. There’s no way to make things convenient for everyone. So the only option is to find a compromise.” – Hikigaya Hachiman</p>
<p>Well, I’m out of things to say now so it’ll pretty much just be Hikigaya Hachiman from now on. Enjoy the chapter.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body and mentality are above a normal person’s, but one hour of high mental concentration is already approaching his limit. The Greedy Giant Toad’s HP has only fallen by 1/10th. Exactly what can he depend on to survive, and to endure for another 9 hours while not missing a single opportunity to attack …</p>
<p>It can only be faith.</p>
<p>The giant toad has already recovered from its rigid status, scary, dark green eyes locking onto him. Ling Chen wiped the sweat on his forehead, his eyes becoming stern. He straightened his body, holding Mind Saber in hand, saying in a low voice: “Come at me!! I… will definitely… not die!!”</p>
<p>Croak!!</p>
<p>A long distance pounce, directly leaping at Ling Chen from a distance of 20 meters. And the further the pounce the more time it will give for the target to react, the less dangerous it is for Ling Chen. Ling Chen held his ragged breath, dodging and jumping like before, and then standing still at a location 10 meters behind the giant toad. This is the most ideal position that he had calculated. At this distance, against Stone Hail, he can escape the enveloped area a bit faster, against the Giant Rock Smash, he has enough distance to react. Most importantly is, this is the longest distance that the barbed tongue can reach, at this position he only needs to jump backwards, and will be able to dodge it, and then he can swiftly charge forward jumping on top of the giant tongue and retaliate.</p>
<p>Croak!!</p>
<p>Under a strange cry, the Greedy Giant Toad abruptly raises its head high, this is its first time doing such a movement. Ling Chen paused for a bit, then seeing the giant toad open its mouth wide, an incredibly terrifying noise releasing from its mouth, traveling throughout the entire area. That voice is exceedingly sharp, making Ling Chen cover his ears in pain. He practically felt as though his ear drums had been pierced, his mind, also falling into a state of complete emptiness after the sound entered his ears.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Mind Saber in Ling Chen’s hand suddenly flickered a silver aura, instantly, Ling Chen mind that had entered a state of confusion returned to clarity, he saw the back legs of the giant toad not far away making an action of kicking the ground, and jumping up high.</p>
<p>Rumble!!</p>
<p>The ground trembled violently, like countless times before, the Greedy Giant Toad once again missed. He kind of innocently let out two croaks, its slow mind unable to comprehend, after releasing the sound waves, how could the human still accurately evade its attack.</p>
<p>Ling Chen increasingly found out how lucky he was to have Mind Saber. The sound attack just now was the Greedy Giant Toad’s “Avarice Sound Wave”, when released it covers a 50 meter radius, which also means that all beings within this area are enveloped within, 100% falling into a confused state for at least 5 seconds under the sound wave. Under the confused condition, the body’s movement is not controlled by the brain. No need for 5 seconds, even 1 or 2 seconds of confusion, is more than enough for the Greedy Giant Toad to insta-kill Ling Chen.</p>
<p>And one of the attributes of Mind Saber, is immunity to “Confusion”!</p>
<p>This attribute that he did not pay attention to before meeting the Greedy Giant Toad, had saved him from the Greedy Giant Toad. As long as Mind Saber is in his hands, besides making his ears hurt for a bit, “Avarice Sound Wave” will not have any effect towards him. Avarice Sound Wave is the Greedy Giant Toad’s scariest attack besides Earth Split, a huge area, 100% chance of at least 5 seconds of confusion, just thinking of it is enough to make people shiver. But Mind Saber, has rendered this scary confusion skill useless.</p>
<p>This Mind Saber that comes from the Hell Spider appeared too luckily, to coincidentally, as if prepared for beforehand. Holding Mind Saber in front of him horizontally, Ling Chen’s eyes flashed like a cold star… Since even God is helping me, then you must die!!</p>
<p>Ha!!</p>
<p>A loud shout reinvigorating his already tired mind, heading for the barbed tongue the giant toad spit out. He did not move backwards, instead directly charging forward, jumping up high, jumping onto the tongue that rubbed past the bottom of his feet as it passed by…</p>
<p>I cannot die!</p>
<p>I cannot lose!!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have leveled up, now LV6, HP+10, MP+10, gained 5AP.”</p>
<p>“Hu…” Yun Feng let out a long breath, and then picked up his spoils, jogging to the safe district, and then happily spending all of his AP, and then sitting on the ground, taking a small break.</p>
<p>“Finally LV6, this leveling system is freakin’ retarded, if things continue like this, it’ll take at least a weeks time to get to LV10 and change to an official class.” Yun Feng mumbled unsatisfied, and then opened his skill page, taking a look, his expression immediately drooping: “Ai, two skills both only at LV3, just thinking of the retarded amount of SP required to reach LV4 makes me want to die!! I don’t fucking believe that someone can max the trainee skills before reaching LV10! SP can only be gained from killing elites or BOSS, who set up this rule! Did someone watch too many idiotic films… the chance of elites appearing is pretty much the same as Mars colliding with Earth. Not to mention BOSS, that Lord BOSS at Wolf’s Cliff, it’s like a world war there.</p>
<p>Complaining for a bit Yun Feng opened his friends page, soon after being dazed for a bit: “He’s only LV5… Hu, maybe he doesn’t care about level, should I talk to him?” Yun Feng thought for a bit, but then discarded the idea. With his initial understanding of Ling Chen’s personality, he feels that Ling Chen should be the type of person that doesn’t want to be bothered. He looked down, his eyes falling on a name, the level displayed after it made his eyes jump.</p>
<p>LV7!</p>
<p>He hurriedly made a call, just getting through, he hastily shouted: “You you you are already LV7!! I entered the game together with you, I’ve been online all day for the past 2 days, not even going offline at night, until now I’m only LV6, but you’re already LV7… Ai, can you not work so hard? If you continue like this sooner or later your body will collapse.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Don’t put too much pressure on yourself, especially don’t force yourself. Believe in me, that person that I found for you will not disappoint you… Um. his identity I can only keep secret for now, he also doesn’t want more people to know about him. But as your brother I guarantee to you, He will definitely not disappoint you… He is, the only person that I truly revere.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The sleeping Shui Ruo faintly opened her eyes, subconsciously, she gently leaned towards Ling Chen beside her, becoming even closer with his body. Soft moonlight seeping in from the window, spilling onto the clock on the wall… The time, is exactly two in the morning.</p>
<p>She looked towards the man beside her, using the twilight moonlight, she saw Ling Chen’s eyebrows slightly furrowed, his face, also showed a faint twist, his teeth, also as if biting together.</p>
<p>“Brother seems to be really seriously doing something, is it that brother has encountered some kind of strong opponent or problem in game?”</p>
<p>She silently thought, and then with great effort used her hands to support her body, lowering her lips, softly kissing Ling Chen on the forehead.</p>
<p>“Brother, keep going, brother is the most amazing in the world. No matter how scary of an enemy or problem, brother will defeat them all.”</p>
<p>Looking at the game device wrapped around her wrist, Ling Shui Ruo closed her eyes: “After I can enter the game like brother, what kind of class should I choose, to be able to help brother…”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>-50, -102, MISS!</p>
<p>“Croak!!!!”</p>
<p>Under the furious cry of the Greedy Giant Toad, Ling Chen was once again thrown far away off its head, landing on the ground Ling Chen didn’t stand steadily, stumbling backwards, continuing to take 7,8 steps before stopping. He lifted his head, opening his eyes wide staring at the giant toad in front, the sound of his breathing is already very rough, his face completely red, the two hands holding Mind Saber slightly shaking, his body could no longer maintain a still condition, making minor sways, only that pair of eyes was still ice cold awake.</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toads HP: 39980/80000!</p>
<p>The time, pointed at two in the morning… From the time that he encountered the Greedy Giant Toad, had already passed by 5 whole hours.</p>
<p>5 entire hours passing by, Ling Chen still did not die, instead snatching away half of the giant toad’s HP.</p>
<p>Finally… took down half of its HP…</p>
<p>His body was already loose as a marshmallow, his mind already so brittle that he is almost unable to control his body’s movements… His vision starting to become blurry, he really wants to throw everything away and lie on the ground and sleep. His mind, has already reached its limits… no, has already surpassed his limits. Right now he is in an exhausted condition supported only by his life and conviction. After today, he might need to sleep for a couple of days straight to recover… or maybe, he’ll also get very sick.</p>
<p>But, there still remained half of the Greedy Giant Toad’s HP.</p>
<p>Can I really not continue further…</p>
<p>But, I’ve already endured until now… how can I willingly give up!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen buckled his teeth, biting the tip of his tongue hard, the intense pain making his almost lax mind suddenly awake, his wavering vision also becoming clear under the intense pain. He saw a massive rock appear in the giant toad’s hand, and then fly towards him with a whistling wind.</p>
<p>His empty body once again exploding with unknown strength, bringing him backwards, dodging the massive rock, his body landing on the ground and directly lying down, evading all of the broken rock pieces. When he stood up, his body violently shook for a moment.</p>
<p>Fwoosh!!</p>
<p>The familiar tongue flying over, right when the Greedy Giant Toad’s big mouth moved Ling Chen already jumped up like a conditioned reflex, narrowly avoiding it, but landing on the ground Ling Chen wasn’t balanced and directly fell onto the ground, helplessly watching the giant toad retract its tongue.</p>
<p>This is the first time, he made a mistake while grasping this rare opportunity of attack…</p>
<p>5 hours of high mental concentration, even if he was a god, he was already near the point of breaking.</p>
<p>And the Greedy Giant Toad that he is facing, still has half its HP!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Whoops, forgot to put a read more tag. You know, after reading a chapter I realized that even though 1000SP doesn’t seem like a lot. To gain 1000SP from a single monster you’d have to kill a LV100 Lord BOSS, LV333 3 star elite, LV500 2-star elite, or LV1000 1- star elite. I think that puts into perspective a bit more how hard this fight is. I shall also be releasing the next 2 chapters some time today.</p>
<p>Ling Chen used his quickest speed to stand up from the ground, fighting the weak feeling in his body, using all of his strength to maintain his balance. In front the the Greedy Giant Toad, it is very dangerous if the body is under an unbalanced condition.</p>
<p>Croak!</p>
<p>Croak!!</p>
<p>Croak!!!!</p>
<p>The next second, the next attack did not arrive. It lifted its head, starting to release strange “Croak” cries, the cries became louder and louder, eventually reaching an ear-splitting state.</p>
<p>This movement…</p>
<p>Avarice Sound Wave? No! This is not the sound for Avarice Sound Wave, what kind of attack method is this? Besides Earth Split which only activates when its life is below 10%, Ling Chen is already familiar with the rest of its attack methods, but this action and sound do not belong to any of the attacks that he already knows…</p>
<p>Wait!!</p>
<p>Could it be… a hidden skill!?</p>
<p>Lord BOSS and above will usually have one or even multiple hidden skills. The activation of these hiddens kills require special conditions, and will not be discovered using regular scan techniques… including the scan scroll.</p>
<p>Right when Ling Chen realised it, the sound of the system’s discovered intel appeared beside his ears…</p>
<p>“Ding… Warning! Greedy Giant Toad has activated an unknown hidden summoning skill, the said summoning skill will only activate when its HP is below 50%, activates once every half hour when HP is below 50%, please face it carefully!”</p>
<p>Summoning skill!?</p>
<p>Under Ling Chen’s surprise, 5 black and green rays of light suddenly fell from the sky, landing around the giant toad, reflecting 5 greenish-black figures.</p>
<p>Those are 5 big toads that even though their size couldn’t compare to the giant toad’s, are still as big as a human.</p>
<p>[Big Man-Eating Toad]: Type: Beast, Level: 10, Grade: 2 Star Elite, HP: 1600. Big toad summoned by the Greedy Giant Toad, possesses a dangerous attack ability, its big mouth can easily swallow an adult human, need to be careful of its pounce and barbed tongue pierce.</p>
<p>5 man-eating toads… 5 LV10 2 star elites!</p>
<p>The summoned man-eating toads immediately came hopping from both sides. Their jumping ability is equally high, one jump crossing a distance of 4,5 meters, a couple hops and already approaching him from the left and right. At the same time, a giant rock was thrown over by the giant toads hands.</p>
<p>BAM!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen did two rolls backwards, dodging the giant rock and the exploding gravel, but after his body steadied, 3 green and black shadows pounced over, Ling Chen whose mind is already completely exhausted couldn’t dodge, being hit by the 3 big toads’ pounces…</p>
<p>-78,-76, -80!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s total HP of 270 fell into critical condition, if not for eating the red blood fruit before, right now he would already be dead. Stumbling a few steps backwards from the three attacks, his body bumping into the wall behind. He tightly held onto the wall behind, almost falling onto the ground. If he fell on the ground, and suffered from another round of the man-eating toads’ attacks, he will surely die.</p>
<p>Adjusting his body, Ling Chen went around the attack of the other two big toads, and then rapidly escaped, pulling apart from them with his 120 movement speed, and then quickly swallowing an orange potion and one of Wang Ji’s specially made health potions.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have used ‘Wang Ji’s Special Health Potion’, Total HP+200, effect lasts for 1 hour.”</p>
<p>The special health potion that he thought wasn’t needed, now had no choice but to be used. Before just facing a Greedy Giant Toad was already incredibly tough, but what was worth comforting is that there was just that one opponent, there would be no other disturbances here, but now, the disturbance came, and 5 of them at once!</p>
<p>He needs to deal with these smaller toads first, or else it won’t be possible to continue.</p>
<p>Rumble!!</p>
<p>The giant toad came pouncing over, Ling Chen just barely dodged it but Ling Chen whose reaction time was clearly slower almost fell to the ground from the proceeding trembling of the ground. His gaze became cold, rushing at the 5 big toads that had already gathered together leaping at him during the opening after the giant toad’s attack, a “Crescent Slash” sweeping over.</p>
<p>Fwoosh Fwoosh Fwoosh Fwoosh Fwoosh!</p>
<p>The attack of the 5 toads were all dodged by him with just a small turn of his body. While charging forward, his Crescent Slash swept through the the 3 closest toads to him.</p>
<p>-110, -108, -111!</p>
<p>The defense and dodge rate of the man-eating toads naturally couldn’t compare with the Greedy Giant Toad’s, under the effect of the health potion and strength potion, his attacks all hit, and all dealt damage over 100. Charging behind the man-eating toads Ling Chen once again turned around and swept across, Crescent Slash flying forward…</p>
<p>-204,-100,-101!</p>
<p>Once again all hitting. And at this time, the giant toad’s attack had already arrived, the scary barbed tongue suddenly attacking from behind.</p>
<p>The suddenly approaching danger did not make Ling Chen turnaround, instead jumping backwards at a hair’s breadth distance, a big roll, just narrowly avoiding the path of the tongue, landing on top of the tongue, and then jumping onto the giant toad’s head following the retraction of the tongue, 3 “Full Power Strike”s mercilessly striking out.</p>
<p>-50, MISS, -51!</p>
<p>His mind had clearly surpassed its limit, his body practically unable to stand steadily, but when death closes in, his mind continues to quickly react, his body also continues to explode with terrifying movement ability… No one can understand, exactly what is supporting his mind and body to endure until now and not fall.</p>
<p>His true limit, exactly where is it, or maybe, he doesn’t even have a limit!?</p>
<p>Croak!!</p>
<p>After 3 attacks, Ling Chen like every time before was thrown off, and the direction he was thrown just happened to be the position of the 5 big toads. Seeing him fall, the 5 man-eating toads all opened their big mouths, 5 1 meter long barbed tongues shooting towards him together.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s pupils severely contracted. He bit his teeth, quickly swallowing a bottle of orange potion that had just come off cooldown, bringing his HP up to 436, and then facing the attacks of the man-eating toads, a Crescent Slash sweeping downwards.</p>
<p>-76, -80, -82, -77, -79.</p>
<p>-110, -141, -108!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s sweep attack and the barbed tongues of the 5 toads practically landed on each other’s bodies at the same time. Ling Chen’s HP that had just recovered nearly emptied. After landing Ling Chen HP only remained its last couple dozen points. He didn’t even think, using his fastest speed to run forward. The cooldown time for recovery potions is 5 seconds, and during the cooldown period all potions of the same type cannot be used. Him who was already in critical condition cannot withstand the attack of even one man-eating toad. Right now he needs to give up on attacking and put all of his effort into recovering HP. At the same time, he realised, before exterminating the 5 man-eating toads, no matter how good of an opportunity, he cannot go and attack the Greedy Giant Toad. The longer the man-eating toads exist, the more dangerous it becomes!</p>
<p>20 seconds later, under a state of only running and dodging, he finally recovered his HP using red potions that recover 100 HP. He only has a dozen or so bottles of orange potions that instantly recover 200 HP, he needs to use them at critical moments, he cannot waste them.</p>
<p>Recovering to max HP Ling Chen’s eyes displayed a cold light, charging straight at the man-eating toads at the risk of suffering from the joint attacks of the man-eating toads’ and Greedy Giant Toad’s…</p>
<p>-106, 112, -117!</p>
<p>-110, -141, -108!</p>
<p>-111, -103, -220.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The attack of one Greedy Giant Toad is scary enough. Now with the addition of the 5 man-eating toads, the pressure on Ling Chen more than doubled. He could only focus his dodging on the Greedy Giant Toad that can kill him with one hit, his exhausted body thus being struck by the man-eating toads again and again. His attacks, also swept through the man-eating toads during intervals between dodging.</p>
<p>-109, -112, -100!</p>
<p>Croak!!</p>
<p>Finally, after a dozen continuous Crescent Slashes, 3 man-eating toads lost all their HP at the same time, falling under Ling Chen’s Mind Saber.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully killed 3 LV10 2 star elite ‘Big Man-Eating Toad’s, Fame+60, SP+60, Current SP: 150.”</p>
<p>Exterminating 3 man-eating toads, the pressure on Ling Chen immediately dropped. He did not start attacking again. Avoiding the barbed tongue of the Greedy Giant Toad, he quickly ran away, and then immediately opened his skill page, putting the 150 SP into Crescent Slash.</p>
<p>The SP required for Crescent Slash to upgrade is exactly 150. Under a bright flash, Crescent Slash once again upgraded.</p>
<p>[Crescent Slash]: Current Level: LV5, Reached Max Level. Beginner skill for apprentice warriors, with their weapons and cross cutting ahead, drawing a small sword arc, dealing 120% regular damage towards 5 targets in a 4 meter forward area, also has a 20% chance to knockback the target. MP Consumption: 7, Cooldown Time: 0 sec.</p>
<p>“Ding… Your trainee skills “Full Power Strike” and “Crescent Slash” have both reached max level, apprentice warrior advanced trainee skill “Fire of Rage” unlocked.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen stared dazed, and then quickly looked towards the newly unlocked trainee skill.</p>
<p>[Fire of Rage]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV5, Sp to Upgrade to LV2: 40, Advanced trainee skill for apprentice warriors, will only unlock when all beginner trainee skills reach max level. After activating higher attack strength is gained from the burning of life force and sacrificing defense. Effect: HP-10, Defense-10, Physical Attack Strength+10, Duration: 10 secs, MP Consumption: 5, Cooldown Time: 1 min.</p>
<p>The final skill of the trainee profession, it is a berserk technique that increases physical attack strength, but due to the fact that its condition for unlocking is too harsh, the amount of apprentice warriors that can unlock this skill are pitifully few. Wasting HP and defense in exchange for 10 points of higher attack strength, for Ling Chen right now it is definitely a good bargain… It’s just that the duration is too short, and the cooldown time is too long, most surprising is the amount of SP for it to upgrade. From LV1 to LV2 Full Power Strike requires 1 SP, Crescent Slash requires 5 points from LV1 to LV2, yet Fire of Rage from LV1 to LV2 needs 40 whole points!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Good …… fire of rage!”</p>
<p>Calling out lightly, Ling Chen buffed himself with this newly unlocked skill. A pale layer of red suddenly appeared on his body, his defense and life fell simultaneously, his attack power increased by ten points. With a faint red glow, Ling Chen turns back toward the last two man-eating giant toads.</p>
<p>-123,-125,-124!</p>
<p>With the effect of fire of rage, the damage to the man-eating toads caused by Ling Chen obviously increased, with his continuous [Crescent Slash], the last two man-eating toads finally fell.</p>
<p>“Ding…… You successfully kill two level 1o two star elite ‘Big Man-Eating Toad’ Fame+4o, Skills points +4o. Remaining skills point: 40.”</p>
<p>40 SP, enough to upgrade ‘Fire of Anger’ to lvl 2, he put all SP to ‘ Fire of Anger’, so it can rose from level 1 to level 2.</p>
<p>[Raging Fire]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level: LV5, Sp to Upgrade to LV3: 90, Advanced trainee skill for apprentice warriors, will only unlock when all beginner trainee skills reach max level. After activating higher attack strength is gained from the burning of life force and sacrificing defense. Effect: HP-20, Defense-20, Physical Attack Strength+20, Duration: 20 secs, MP Consumption: 10, Cooldown Time: 1 min.</p>
<p>The [Fire of Rage] after upgrade enhanced greatly, the attack increased by 20 points and the duration reached 20 seconds, but life and defense and MP usage increased by double too.</p>
<p>After killing all the Man-Eating Toad’, Ling Chen’s mind weakened, he almost collapsed to the ground. He bit his tongue hard enough to wake himself up, he made his way towards the Greedy Giant Toad standing 10 meters in front of him. His eyes are wide open, he forced his body and consciousness… He has held up until now, how can he fall!!!</p>
<p>Whoosh! !</p>
<p>Fortunately, the greedy giant toad spit out its tongue again, Ling Chen’s exhausted body broke its limit, even for ordinary humans in their peak condition the attack is extremely difficult to avoid, but he successfully landed on the tongue, he released at the same time [Fire of Rage]… With the help of the giant tongue he jumped to the greedy giant toad’s head, he released 3 powerful attacks…</p>
<p>-83, miss, -81!</p>
<p>With the help of [Fire of Rage] the damage inflicted to the Giant Greedy Toad improved greatly, if he can keep his damage rate, the time needed to kill the Giant Toad will significantly reduce by a good amount… But in this state can Ling Chen dodge the Greedy Giant Toad’s next attack? Even if he can, can he keep attacking efficiently as before?</p>
<p>There are only 5 bottles of special potions left, and in a few minutes the remaining effects will end, then there are only four bottles. There are maybe enough special potions, but his mana potions have been slow consumed, with [Fire of Rage] the consumption rate has increased. In addition, the original red and orange potions are now being used because of the giant toad attack and the use of [Fire of Rage]. Once the mana and the life of the potion are depleted, then he will be on deaths door…</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo opened her eyes, in the dim light, she saw the clock at the wall it’s 6 o’clock in the morning, behind the windows there is faint white, a new day has come. In the past this time, she always had a deep sleep; she needs to sleep a lot. But tonight she woke up three times in a row; there is some anxiety in her heart.</p>
<p>She turned towards Ling Chen, using the twilight moonlight; she saw Ling Chen’s eyebrows slightly furrowed, his face, also showed a faint twist, his teeth, also as if biting together.</p>
<p>She turned to see Ling Chen……. His eyebrows are furrowed worse than before, his lips closed tightly, his expression is twisted, and there is a row of cold sweat on his forehead… His expression is like trying to endure. Struggling against something.</p>
<p>“Brother……” Ling Shui Ruo gently whispers, stretching out her hand and gently wiping the sweat on his forehead. She finally understands why she woke up often this night… Because he was suffering, and experienced a great challenge, she can’t feel peace because of his pain. After all, to her, he is everything and is more important than herself (1)…</p>
<p>“Brother, keep going… There is nothing that can defeat brother.”</p>
<p>Morning 6 o’clock, from the time Ling Chen entered the 5th area to now it’s passed already 9 hours.</p>
<p>In the 5th area is filled with battle noise, without a moment of silence. Ling Chen is still not dead.</p>
<p>“Ugh”</p>
<p>Clang! Boum! Crash! ReKlang! (2)</p>
<p>With his last [Crescent Slash], 4 man-eating toads, empty of their lives, fall in front of Ling Chen, he had also been struck by two of the toads’ tongue attack, falling backwards.</p>
<p>“Ding…… You successfully kill four level 1o Two star Elite “Giant Man-Eating Toad”, Fame+8o, Skill Points +8o. The remaining skills point: 3oo.”</p>
<p>For four hours, he was fighting against nine waves of man-eating toads, five every time. Every toad appearing with the wave fell to their death, it was the most difficult and longest time to make it through for Ling Chen. How dangerous and frightening that period was , only he knows. He did not know how many times he had stepped on death’s door …… but, he didn’t fall. The 45 man-eating giant toads, all died under the blade of his sword.</p>
<p>The 45 man-eating giant toad gave him plenty of experience, enough to nearly shoot him to the next level. At the same time, he received 900 Skill points.</p>
<p>45 level 1o two-stars elite, an elite line-up that can’t be appearing somewhere else.</p>
<p>Those skills point gave him the opportunity to upgrade his advanced trainee skill [Rage of Fire] to level 5. All of his novice warriors skills are at max level, if he were to tell someone, no one would believe him.</p>
<p>Greedy giant toad’ HP 10897/80000.</p>
<p>With the upgrade of Raging Fire, the damage caused by Ling Chen to the Giant Toad improved greatly. Before he used 5 hours to cut down the toad’s life to 40000, with the help of [Raging Fire] after 4 h he had eliminated almost 30000 of the giant toad’s HP. The attack damage has increased but his mental strength grew weaker, he had a more difficult time to escape the piercing tongue, escaping is already difficult, grasping the opportunity of attack after dodging was also becoming lower, he can attack only once every minutes or two, sometimes the chances to attack are even longer.</p>
<p>He looks like he has an enormous amount of willpower…Up until now, he didn’t stop, he fought and survived under the endless attacks of the Boss, he is even able to lower the Boss HP under 20%.</p>
<p>But even with strong willpower, stronger than normal people, he still has to have a final limit.</p>
<p>Ling Chen that was hit by the Greedy Giant Toad lay sideways on the ground, his vision already entirely blurry. This time, for a whole 3 seconds, he did not stand up. No matter his body, or his eyelids, they are all so heavy that they just cannot move. In the game world, the body will not be exhausted, because the human’s body does not actually enter the game word, but the exhaustion of the mind is real… Because what enters the game world, is exactly a person’s mind. It is a person’s mind that experiences everything within the game, and controls all of the movements of their body in the game.</p>
<p>The over exhaustion of his mind, has made him practically unable to continue controlling his body. He struggled to make his eyes not close… He is afraid that once he shuts his eyes, he will fall into a long period of deep slumber.</p>
<p>HP still remaining 96 points, MP still remaining 25 points.</p>
<p>And, all of the special potions, HP recovery potions, MP recovery potion have already been finished… all of them.</p>
<p>Right now, for Ling Chen regardless if it’s his mind or replenishments, they have all reached a burned out state.</p>
<p>… Just close your eyes like this and sleep. Making your mind so exhausted to such an extent for just for a small BOSS in the game world, is simply not worth it. Continuing like this, you will definitely get very sick. Moreover, gaining a silver sword at the bottom of this chasm, gaining large amounts of SP, all of you skills reaching max level, this is a huge harvest that regular players couldn’t even dream of, it is already enough…</p>
<p>A weak voice spoke like this in his mind. But immediately, this voice was interrupted by an even sharper voice: “You cannot die!! You’ve already endured until now, how can you willingly die! How many people wanted to take away your life but were unable to do so, how much torture did you suffer but did not break down your will. Even that most terrifying man died by your hands. At the game world before, you also never had a single death… How can you be willing to die under the hands of only a LV10 creature!”</p>
<p>Vaguely, he heard an abnormal air current behind him. He immediately bit his teeth hard, the strength accumulated by his faith pouring into his right leg, exerting force and stepping towards the stone wall beside him.</p>
<p>Rip~~~~~</p>
<p>Under this step, his body suddenly slid aside, almost at the same time, the long barbed tongue touched the position that he was at an instant ago.</p>
<p>He once again brushed shoulders with death, even after reaching such a condition, he still continued to struggle, not willing to die.</p>
<p>This last bit of HP, this last bit of MP, a mind that is only a hair’s breadth away from completely collapsing… The Ling Chen right now no longer had any strength to attack, even his last bit of strength is already unbearably weak… completely falling into a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>What he has to face, is the still remaining 10 thousand HP of the Greedy Giant Toad.</p>
<p>1 Author ლ(ಥ益ಥლ you ….</p>
<p>2 Noise</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Well, I’m done with Hikigaya now. Don’t know about [R.E.A.D.E.R.]. I’ll be putting books I recommend now, Chinese and English. First book, 史上第一祖师爷 (History’s Number 1 Founder) is a must read for me and on my recommended list. I’ll be starting to translate this some time in the future.</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad jumped up high. Feeling the wind from the giant toad’s jump, Ling Chen heavily bit the cusps of his teeth, even though he was already using a lot of strength, but right now, even from biting his tongue he could not feel a lot of pain. His mind cleared just a slight bit, at the moment before the giant toad landed on the ground, he jumped up… the height of the jump is very small, but it is just barely enough to avoid the trembling of the ground. He then squeezed out the last bits of his concentration while biting his teeth, recklessly charging forward.</p>
<p>Countless rocks under a piercing wind fell over his head, Ling Chen did not turn his head, using all of his strength to run forward. With his current condition he cannot depend on his senses to find gaps in the concentrated falling rocks to dodge, the only thing he can do is run with all his strength… to run out of range before the falling rocks can hit his body.</p>
<p>Every falling rock above his head is a shadow of death, as longs as just one rock make contact with his body, all of his persistence during these 9 hours, all of his hard work will be wasted. Ling Chen could no longer feel the weight of his body, running… running with all of his strength… but, the speed that the shadow of death approached at greatly surpassed his current running speed.</p>
<p>“AHHHHH!!”</p>
<p>Under that incredibly hoarse cry, Ling Chen’s body flew forward, and then closing his eyes, letting his body to heavily fall on the ground.</p>
<p>A the instant that his body is about to land on the ground, countless rocks fell on the ground behind him, mercilessly pounding on top of the cold, hard ground.</p>
<p>Listening to the sound of falling rocks beside his ears, Ling Chen knows, he is not dead yet.</p>
<p>His hands grasping the cold stone wall, he tried his best a couple times, but was unable to control his two hand to make him stand up. He gave up, easing himself under severe breathing… Taking advantage of the Greedy Giant Toad’s short few seconds of rigidness to allow his mind to recover just a small little bit…</p>
<p>This time, he really couldn’t stand up. And could no longer go and attack it or avoid its attacks.</p>
<p>Although, to be able to last for so long against a Fairie BOSS by himself while LV5, it can be considered pretty good, right.</p>
<p>The corners of his lips slightly moved, and then extending his arm while trembling… In his palm, there is a dark green item.</p>
<p>Hell Spider’s Saliva.</p>
<p>Right now, I can only depend on you…</p>
<p>This is the last sliver of uncertain hope…</p>
<p>It has already been a dozen hours since he gained the hell spider’s saliva. Its effect, has also definitely dropped by more than half. The Greedy Giant Toad still has around 13% of its HP. Ling Chen doesn’t know if the hell spider saliva can eliminate the rest of its HP…. If it succeeds, then, all of his persistence and effort will bear fruit, all of his exhaustion will also be drowned by gratification and excitement. If it fails… then, there really is no more hope, not a single bit.</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad has recovered from its rigid state after releasing Stone Hail, dark green eyes once again locking onto Ling Chen. Ling Chen took a deep breath, suddenly biting his teeth, squeezing out his last drop of concentration, controlling his arms and throwing the hell spider saliva at the Greedy Giant Toad with all of his strength.</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad still has one skill it hasn’t used, and that is that final large area indiscriminate AOE attack. Once this skill is released, even if Ling Chen was at top condition he would still be insta-killed without any doubt.</p>
<p>He fought without using the hell spider’s saliva even while its effect slowly weakened, so that at the end when the Greedy Giant Toad’s HP drops near 10% he can eliminate the rest of its HP all at once. Making it not have a chance to use its ultimate move, or else if it releases its ultimate move, all of the hard work from before will be wasted.</p>
<p>Around 13% remaining HP, still quite a distance from 10%m but he no longer had the ability to get rid of more of the giant toad’s HP. Using his last bit of strength, Ling Chen threw out his last hope.</p>
<p>The hell spider’s saliva flew out following a perfect parabola, flying ou 20 meters in a moment, landing on the giant toad’s body that was about to jump up…</p>
<p>Croak!!!</p>
<p>The hell spider’s saliva exploded on the Greedy Giant Toad’s body, splattering dark green fluid tainting its body, and then quickly seeping into its body. The giant toad’s body that was about to jump up immediately froze, and then let out a strange cry of pain…</p>
<p>The giant toad’s cry of pain meant that… the hell spider’s saliva was working on its body!!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen opened his eyes wide, staring at the giant toad that was contaminated by the hell spider’s poison, his two hands clenching tighter…</p>
<p>It has to succeed… It has to work!!</p>
<p>-?????.</p>
<p>Under the watch of his shaky vision, a 5-digit number floated up from the giant toad’s head. Ling Chen’s vision was already increasingly blurry, he could only faintly see that it is a 5-digit number. Instantly, his heart started to pump excitedly. Because before this, the Greedy Giant Toad’s HP was 10897. And under the 5-digit damage caused by the hell spider’s saliva, it will definitely…</p>
<p>He widened his eyes a bit more, focusing his mind, finally clearly seeing that already dimming 5-digit damage… When the 5 red numbers entered his eyes, his pupils contracted to the size of the point of a needle.</p>
<p>-10482!</p>
<p>That is only a damage that barely surpasses 5-digits… it did not clear the Greedy Giant Toad’s HP.</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad’s remaining HP: 415/80000!</p>
<p>There still remains the last 415 HP.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes dimmed, 415, the last sliver of the giant toad’s remnant HP. From 80000, using 9 hours, with completely exhausting his mind as the price, slowly whittling its HP down to the last 415 points…</p>
<p>Yet becoming a hopeless gulf that cannot be crossed.</p>
<p>“Croak!!!!”</p>
<p>“Croak!!!!!!”</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad with just 1/100ths of its HP remaining in an instant cried out in fury, its head raising high, 2 dark eyes releasing a cruel aura that would make people tremble in fear… As for its body, a group of thick yellow light started to flash, illuminating the entire area in and increasingly heavy yellow colour.</p>
<p>On the ground, from light to heavy it started to tremble, an air of destruction enveloping the entire area.</p>
<p>Ling Chen instantly knew… this is the precursor to its strongest skill “Earth Split” that activates once its HP drops below 10%.</p>
<p>9 hours of hard work using all of his strength, only 415 HP remaining… but all just one step short of success.</p>
<p>He is not willing to accept this, how could he!</p>
<p>But, what could he use to get rid of this last 415 HP… He cannot pierce the defense of the Greedy Giant Toad’s body, he can only depend on the tongue to jump to its head and damage it. Even if he can move freely, right now he didn’t have any chances. Because the skill that he didn’t want to see the most, the skill that once activated would surely make him die, was already being released.</p>
<p>Can it really only end like this…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Brother is the strongest person in the world, no problem can beat brother, I also have to be strong like brother.</p>
<p>So, I will not die… Without completing my promise towards brother, how can I die.</p>
<p>For brother, I will not give up even the slightest bit of hope…</p>
<p>Brother, let me be as strong as you, let us be strong together…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo’s smiling face appeared in Ling Chen’s shaking consciousness. The girl whose body was clearly weaker than her parents’, who was clearly more seriously infected with the Isrock virus than her parents. For him, for that beautiful promise, continued to struggle two years after the death of her parents.</p>
<p>Slowly, Ling Chen stood up from the ground… Him who could barely even open his eyelids, actually stood up using strength that he did not know where it came from, and then inch by inch raised the Mind Saber in his hands.</p>
<p>Ruo Ruo, this is the strength that the you who has always been by my side has given me… You are trying so hard, just to live until 21 this kind of hope that couldn’t be any slimmer. Finally, the hope that you were not willing to give up has welcomed a miracle… No, it is not a miracle, instead it is your reward after working so hard. In truth, you’ve always been stronger than me, a lot more stronger than me.</p>
<p>Then, let me be like you, persisting until my last drop of strength for that sliver of hope…</p>
<p>The me right now, can only muster one last attack… What I can have, is only that last sliver of almost unseeable hope…</p>
<p>Ruo Ruo, bless and protect me!!</p>
<p>Lifting Mind Saber, he ran towards the Greedy Giant Toad. Thinking of Ruo Ruo, his conviction that was on the verge of collapsing revived, supporting his crumbling consciousness, giving him the strength to unleash this last attack…</p>
<p>“Fire of Rage!!”</p>
<p>Red light enveloping Ling Chen’s body, his already critical HP once more dropping down 50 points, defense dropping 50 points, MP dropping 20 points… Only remaining the last 5 MP, just enough to unleash one “Full Power Strike”</p>
<p>[Fire of Rage]: Current Level: LV5, Max Level Reached, Advanced trainee skill for apprentice warriors, will only unlock when all beginner trainee skills reach max level. After activating higher attack strength is gained from the burning of life force and sacrificing defense. Effect: HP-50, Defense-50, Physical Attack Strength+50, Duration: 30 secs, MP Consumption: 20, Cooldown Time: 1 min. (TL: Upgrade points LV1—40→LV2—90→LV3—160→LV4—250→LV5，540 total)</p>
<p>Fire of Rage that had reached max level can add 50 points of physical attack strength, this kind of buff at the novice village stage is definitely OP. But on the other hand, how many apprentice warriors in the China region can unlock Fire of Rage at the novice stage? Unlock this skill, how high can they raise the level? If they really can do it, then this kind of skill effect couldn’t be considered exaggerated.</p>
<p>Under the simultaneous effects of Wang Ji’s Special Strength Potion, beginner strength crystal, and Fire of Rage, Ling Chen’s basic attack strength reached 169. The expressions of hesitation and unwillingness disappeared from his face. Only the massive figure of the green and black Greedy Giant Toad remained in his eyes. He even didn’t notice, his current running speed was actually so rapid… His mind was clearly exhausted, his body couldn’t even stand steadily, yet his running speed has reached the maximum that he can attain.</p>
<p>The ground shook more and more violently, the air of destruction trembled in every inch of the space. The giant figure in his eyes became closer and closer, Ling Chen jumped up, Raising up high Mind Saber, cutting towards the Greedy Giant Toad…</p>
<p>“Full…Power…Strike…”</p>
<p>Using his last bit of faith and concentration, the last 5 MP, unleashing his last Full Power Strike.</p>
<p>Shing…</p>
<p>He heard the sound of cutting, the attack that couldn’t have ripped through the Greedy Giant Toad’s defense, had cut into the giant toad’s body, deeply cutting in…</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad’s “Earth Split” had already finished charging, yellow light about to explode, and it is at that brief to the point that it could not be briefer moment before exploding, a rapid shadow bringing up a silver light, cut into its body .</p>
<p>The scene, froze at this instant.</p>
<p>The yellow light that had expanded to its limit did not explode, The Greedy Giant Toad’s massive body also stopped moving as if frozen. At the area of contact between Mind Saber and its body, a purple number slowly floated upwards…</p>
<p>-507!</p>
<p>With only 3/1000 of a chance… Critical plus pierce!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Here’s another chapter, and that’s the last of my stockpile. Yeah, I haven’t really stocked up much. If you read fantasy you probably already know this series but for those who don’t. The Kingkiller Chronicles is a must read. It’s not your traditional sword and sorcery fantasy and really focuses a lot more on plot and character development that turning the MC into an OP beast. Also, luckily the final book is coming out sometime this year. Go buy the books! Name of the Wind, The Wise Man’s Fear, The Doors of Stone (unreleased).</p>
<p>Greedy Giant Toad’s HP: 0/80000.</p>
<p>Slashing out the last strike, Ling Chen’s mind finally collapsed, he practically couldn’t feel the existence of his body, only able to let himself fall over like a sponge. In his hazy vision, he saw a touch of purple… He smiled, and then heavily fell on the ground. Even though he could not clearly see how big the damage number is, but seeing that touch of purple, was enough.</p>
<p>It was a success…</p>
<p>At this final moment, under the support of his last bit of conviction, he activated that hope with only 3/1000 of a chance… No, this could only be called a miracle. (TL: Referring to the hope and how it should be called a miracle.)</p>
<p>The Greedy Giant Toad’s health bar had already become entirely black. It maintained its position of releasing “Earth Split”, a pair of dark green eyes slowly dimming, its giant mouth opening wide… And then in a final cry of despair, slowly fell backwards, falling on the ground with a “Rumble” four feet facing the sky, causing the dust on the ground to fly everywhere… No longer able to move, its giant eyes losing all light at this moment.</p>
<p>Greedy Giant Toad… dead.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully killed LV10 Fairie BOSS ‘Greedy Giant Toad’, Fame+1000, SP+1000.”</p>
<p>Ding… You are the first player in《Mystic Moon》to kill a Fairie BOSS, Reward Earned: Fame+1000, Gold+1000, SP+1000, Gained unique item ‘Consonance Insignia’.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV6, HP+10, MP+10, AP+5.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV7…”</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV8…”</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV9, HP+10, MP+10, AP+5.”</p>
<p>“Ding… You have sacrificed your mind and spirit in a desperate situation, using your persistence to overcome an unbeatable opponent, creating a miracle in the end, soloing a LV10 Fairie BOSS in a LV5 condition. First one to reach 《Mystic Moons》’s ‘Miracle’ condition, gained one impasse skill.”</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully exterminated “Greedy Giant Toad”, the door towards the sixth area of “The Forgotten Cave” has been opened.”</p>
<p>The sound of system notifications rang beside his ears for a long time, the EXP given by a Fairie BOSS is quite huge, his level in a continuous light continuously rose 4 levels. In the end, slowly stopping at 50% of LV9… Undoubtedly, in this instant, he had risen from an insignificant level, to the highest in all of China… LV9, right now this is a level that regular players simply cannot reach.</p>
<p>9 hours of struggle, dedication and persistence that did not shake even with a completely exhausted mind… This truly is a miracle, a miracle that only he can create. These rewards, are also the rewards that he deserved after all of that hard work and determination.</p>
<p>His extreme strength addition, Mind Saber, the special potions from the item shop, the hell spider’s saliva dropped by the hell spider, “Fire of Rage” that was unlocked during the fight against the Greedy Giant Toad, that last miraculous strike… If any of these elements were missing, this miraculous finish would not have occurred. Without that blessed sapphire necklace, he wouldn’t even be here. Real miracles, have always been the combination of luck, hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>The death of a Fairie BOSS will undoubtedly be accompanied by a very fabulous explosion, Ling Chen’s blurry vision saw that when the Greedy Giant Toad fell down, a large group of different coloured items dropped from its body. His mind that had completely relaxed fell into irresistible exhaustion, he could no longer go and see what those trophies are, even more he did not have the strength to go and pick them up. His eyes closed, directly falling asleep, before his consciousness disappeared, his ears continued to be surrounded by system notifications.</p>
<p>“Ding… Your mind has already fallen into a very dangerous condition, for your safety, you will be forcibly kicked offline.”</p>
<p>When the system notification sounded, Ling Chen was already surrounded in a white light and kicked offline. Leaving this 5th area that had finally calmed down. The initially sleeping behemoth here, now lay there 4 feet facing the sky, without any sound. Its surrounding lay all kinds of items emitting a magnificent radiance… If the items dropped by a regular creature, including Lord BOSS are not picked up by anyone for a long period of time, they will automatically disappear. But for Faerie and above BOSS even if no one picks them up they will never disappear, including their bodies. It is because of this that Ling Chen was able to peacefully fall asleep. He believed that no other beings would appear in this area, at least in a short period of time, and so there would be no one to take away his spoils.</p>
<p>This nap, Ling Chen slept very deeply. This degree of mental exhaustion was practically scarier than not sleeping for ten days straight. A normal person exhausted to such a degree would probably have lost half their life, needing at least half a month to recover…</p>
<p>But, not even reaching the afternoon, Ling Chen instantly woke up. He abruptly sat up on the bed, his head as if about to explode, his eyelids so heavy that he practically couldn’t open them, he struggled to make his vision more clear, looking towards the clock on the wall…</p>
<p>6:00 in the afternoon! (TL: Yeah I don’t know, either he took forever to look at the clock or the author just didn’t give a crap)</p>
<p>“Brother, you’re awake… Here, drink something first, and then go back to sleep, okay!”</p>
<p>A soft voice made his murky consciousness become wide awake. He saw Ling Shui Ruo’s eyes, after being dazed for a bit, he hurriedly supported her delicate shoulders saying anxiously: “Ruo Ruo, are you hungry, did you not eat breakfast and lunch…”</p>
<p>He hit his head… The reason he woke up so quickly is because he was subconsciously worrying about Ling Shui Ruo. Without him Ling Shui Ruo couldn’t even walk, she can’t take care of herself at all. But when he woke up, it was already the afternoon. This also meant that there was no one to take care of Ling Shui Ruo for a whole day, he was so remorseful that he wanted to smash his head into a wall.</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo smiled, lightly shaking her head: “Of course not, I’ve always been able to take care of myself. If brother doesn’t believe me then look… For breakfast I ate a big piece of bread, and a cup of warm milk, this is proof… At noon I drank a large bottle of fruit juice, and even ate all of the fruit that brother washed, see, the proof is here. I’ve also already prepared dinner, and prepared brother’s share too… look brother. Hi, although I’m still going to need brother to do all the dish washing.”</p>
<p>The table beside the bed is filled with bread paper, a glass cup stained with milk, an empty bottle of fruit juice, and a small plate of fruit skins and seeds… along with two hot cups of milk. Ling Chen lightly smiled, but his nose slightly twitched, his eyes feeling as though there was something quietly spilling out… He seemed as if he saw the delicate girl in front of him difficulty putting on her clothes, controlling the wheelchair looking for breakfast and lunch… and then purposely putting the evidence of having eaten breakfast and lunch in front of him… only so that he didn’t worry about her, especially so that he didn’t feel remorse.</p>
<p>“It’s clearly brother who hasn’t eaten anything for a whole day… Brother, hurry up and finish this glass of milk, or else you’re not allowed to sleep.” Ling Shui Ruo carried the glass of milk placing it before him. Ling Chen hurriedly grasped her hands… He understood most the weight this little cup meant towards this girl.</p>
<p>“Today I…”</p>
<p>“Tell it to me once brother has finished resting, right now you need to obediently finish this milk. It’s already been a long time… since I’ve warmed up milk for brother.” Ling Shui Ruo stared at Ling Chen, gently saying.</p>
<p>Ling Chen did not continue speaking, smiling warmly, putting his head back and gulping down the milk…Overworking for a night, and not eating anything for a day, he was indeed already famished.</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo tenderly stared at him the whole time, her eyes gentle as water. Suddenly her eyebrows arched, she started to laugh, laughing very happily: “Brother, do you know, at noon time, I didn’t depend on the wheelchair, walking from one end of the living room to the other, and then back, only falling down once in-between… and did not hold onto anything!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Before, with his support Ling Shui Ruo could only walk 7,8 step. Without any support, she pretty much couldn’t even stand. Shui Ruo would never trick him… She really walked around the living room by herself!?!?</p>
<p>Is it the 23113 medicine taking effect!? (TL: It seems like the author has changed it to 23113 for whatever reason.)</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s heart started to race, the joy he felt in his heart was 100 times greater than when he slayed the Greedy Giant Toad. He put down the empty glass, suppressing the excitement in his heart and on his face, using a slightly trembling voice to say: “Shui Ruo, tomorrow, we’ll…we’ll go to the hospital again!”</p>
<p>“Okay!!”</p>
<p>Before, the hospital was always the place that Shui Ruo feared the most, every time she came here, her bright face would be covered with a layer of paleness. But this time, she agreed so simply and excitedly. Because she could feel the change in her body… and even more clearly saw the future of her and her brother.</p>
<p>“Rest for a bit first Ruo Ruo, dinner will be done in a jiffy!” Carrying Shui Ruo back to the bed, Ling Chen jumped off from the bed, accurately slipping into his slippers. This amazing good news completely swept away the exhaustion in his mind.</p>
<p>“But, brother looks so tired, brother should rest more.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I’ve already slept for a whole day, any more and I’ll turn into a pig.” Ling Chen walked out of the room laughing, heading straight for the kitchen.</p>
<p>Today’s dinner is particularly delicious, Ling Chen and Shui Ruo both ate a lot. At night, Ling Chen peacefully fell asleep gently embracing Shui Ruo’s soft body, not entering the world of Mystic Moon, he was also truly too tired. Even with his abnormal constitution, it was time to take a proper rest.</p>
<p>In another place, beside the corpse of a giant toad, a large group of items flickering a variety of lights quietly lay on the ground, waiting for someone to take them away.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Thanks for all your opinions guys. What I shall do is keep posting daily updates and then at certain times unleash what I have stored. Also with stuff like the toad fight if I have stored chapters I will release them all at once. Recommended book of the day is The Roar written by Emma Clayton. Don’t remember much so I left a Wikipedia link. What I do remember is that I absolutely loved the book. It is succeeded by The Whisperer, although don’t know why but I never cared for the second book. Anyways buy The Roar at least, it shan’t disappoint. And no, this is not a payed advertisement.</p>
<p>“This… This is impossible! There has to be some kind of mistake somewhere!!”</p>
<p>The middle aged female doctor wearing a thick white gown took off her glasses and rubbed her eyes, unable to believe the information recorded on the result sheet before her eyes.</p>
<p>“Doctor, what’s the result?” Ling Chen calmly asked.</p>
<p>“A large part of the Isrock virus is actually under an inactive condition, the activity of the other half has also noticeably decreased… This is simply impossible, Little Cui, immediately check the instruments, and then take some more blood again for assessment. There is definitely a problem with this result.” Putting down the result sheet in her hands, the middle aged doctor told the equally dressed nurse beside her.</p>
<p>“There’s no need, this result is already enough.” Ling Chen and Ling Shui Ruo smiled at each other, waving his hand towards the doctor, and then pushing the wheelchair, walking towards the door without even turning his head: “Doctor, I think that we won’t be coming back again in the future.”</p>
<p>“Thank you auntie, thank you for your care during this time, good bye.” Ling Shui Ruo turned her head, smiling towards the middle aged doctor and waving her hands. And then, leaving together with her brother, disappearing from the vision of the dumbfounded doctor.</p>
<p>“They, don’t actually believe the results, right?” The doctor once again flipped through the result sheet and x-rays, shaking her head as before: “The Isrock virus has lost its activity, even though it’s not dead, but it’s like it’s hibernating… The death of the Isrock virus is not uncommon, but losing activity in such a large group, this is simply impossible, never even heard of. There’s definitely a problem somewhere. If they think it’s true then that’s not bad either, hope it can bring that girl some happiness in the last moments of her life.”</p>
<p>Walking on the streets, the bright sunlight made people intoxicated. (TL: I think it just means that it’s really nice outside)</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo got a big tub of ice cream, holding it in her hands and slowly eating it, feeling that sense of coldness that started from her tongue and spread throughout the rest of her body. Soon, her lips and cheeks were covered with dots of cold cream and chocolate. Where they went, many people stopped their footsteps, just staring at the appearance of Ling Shui Ruo eating ice cream, as if seeing a beautiful angel that accidentally fell into the mortal realm, completely stunned. Sometimes, a person beside them will hurriedly whisper something in their ears, and then their faces will turn white, their expressions turning from amazement to pity and sympathy.</p>
<p>Even though she is only 16, she is already incredibly beautiful. People who have seen her cannot help but wanting to know her name, and with that, more and more people knew her, and more and more people knew that she is infected with Isrock… As a result, as they walked they drew in a lot of stares, but no one dared to get close. And because of that, their two person world has been very peaceful, basically without any disturbances from a third person. Or else, with Ling Shui Ruo’s looks that are enough to make angel’s jealous, even if they wanted peace it would not be possible.</p>
<p>“Brother, when I recover, let’s go back to Zhong Zhou, okay? It’s very peaceful there, there’s our old home, that is the place that I was born and grew up, it is also the place that I met brother.” Ling Shui Ruo closed her eyes, recalling those unforgettable scenes in tranquility. (TL: Zhong Zhou appears to be the old name for Henan Province though I don’t really know)</p>
<p>“Okay!” Ling Chen agreed with a smile. His only purpose in bringing Ling Shui Ruo to Beijing was to search for a hope to cure Isrock. Because Beijing is the capital of China, it is the area with China’s most advanced medical practice. If Shui Ruo completely recovers, then they no longer have any reason to stay here. Beijing is too busy, too noisy, and is also hiding too much darkness, it is not a place suitable for them. Coming to Beijing for two years, he always longed to return to that home that even though wasn’t very luxurious, was always so very warm.</p>
<p>Walking past the distribution point for the Mystic Moon game device, Ling Chen turned his head and looked over. Even though today is already the fourth day of Mystic Moon’s opening, a long line still waited in front of the distribution point. At the beginning, this is also where Yun Feng discovered him, and took the initiative to give the 23113 medicine.</p>
<p>Maybe, it really is destiny.</p>
<p>I, Ling Chen, never owe anybody anything. What you gave me, can be considered the greatest favor that I have ever received. Then, your sister’s matter, I believe that when the time comes you will not be disappointed!</p>
<p>Exactly what kind of girl is she… that girl called Yun Meng Xin?</p>
<p>How much has she planned for the guild that she wants to create… and how big has it grown?</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Returning home it was already 10 in the morning. Taking a trip to the hospital and back, Shui Ruo was already very tired, quickly falling asleep after being carried to bed by Ling Chen. Ling Chen lied back on the sofa, his head still having an evident feeling of heaviness, but he did not continue to rest, instead quickly entering the game world… He did not forget, he still hasn’t collected his trophies from that hard battle!! Items dropped by a Faerie BOSS, at the current novice stage, are definitely at an OP level.</p>
<p>“Ding… Welcome to the world of 《Mystic Moon》, we hope you have a pleasant experience.”</p>
<p>Appearing in the place early morning yesterday he went offline, the first thing that entered his eyes is the giant corpse of the Greedy Giant Toad. Faerie and above creatures, their bodies and drops will never disappear. This is common knowledge in the virtual game world. Beside the giant corpse is sprawled a multitude of items that made his eyes blind.</p>
<p>Truly items dropped from a Faerie BOSS, just the scale is enough to shock people.</p>
<p>At his feet is a big pile of gold coins and potions. There are at least 100 gold coins, as for potions… they are all higher grade potions not sold in the Novice Village item shop.</p>
<p>[Green Potion]: Intermediate HP recovery potion, after use HP immediately recovers 800 points, Cooldown Time: 5 secs.</p>
<p>[Dark Blue Potion]: Intermediate MP recovery potion, after use MP immediately recovers 200 points, Cooldown Time: 5 secs.</p>
<p>10 of each of the green potion and dark blue potion were dropped, these potions that cannot be bought in the Novice Village can save his life at critical moments. Ling Chen put them away one by one.</p>
<p>Surprises always have to be left until last to enjoy… Ling Chen first purposely picked up all of the gold coins and potions, only then looking towards the other items. At his feet, there are two pieces of equipment releasing a silver glow… They are a silver coloured helmet and a silver coloured bracer.</p>
<p>Two silver equipment!!</p>
<p>[Silver Helmet]: Type: Head Equipment, Grade: Silver, Equipment Requirements: Any class LV10 or above. Helmet forged from silver, flickers a mysterious silver radiance, Attributes: Defense+13, Strength+5, Constitution+5, Water Elemental Resistance+3%.</p>
<p>[Silver Bracers]: Type: Handguard, Grade: Silver, Equipment Requirements: Any class LV10 or above. Bracers forged from silver, flickers a mysterious silver radiance, Attributes: Defense+10, Attack+8, Hit Rate+6, Critical Hit Rate+2%.</p>
<p>Before, he was still thrilled about gaining a silver equipment Mind Saber, but now, he simultaneously gained two silver equipment. Truly worthy of being silver equipment, the stats added are completely superior to iron and copper equipment. Maybe during mid, late game silver equipment will be common and not considered top tier gear, but at the low stat stage of novices, the stats they add can allow a player to directly leave the rest of the players in their dust. Just take the silver helmet for example, 5 points of strength, 5 points of constitution, what it gives is 10 basic attribute points that can only be gained from leveling up twice, the equivalent of leaving white geared players behind two levels. And this is just a helmet, if the entire body is silver… the difference is especially easy to imagine.</p>
<p>But for this reason also the chance of silver equipment appearing at the novice stage can be said to be very low, just having a piece of copper equipment is already worth flaunting.</p>
<p>Like so, his body will soon be covered with 3 pieces of silver equipment, taking a glance at his current equipment, Ling Chen looked forward… in his vision appeared two dots flickering a golden radiance.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s heart immediately started to race, golden radiance, could it be… gold equipment!?</p>
<p>Rapidly moving forward, Ling Chen picked them all up.</p>
<p>[Sand Blade]: Type: Two Hand Sword: Grade: Gold, Equipment Requirements: Any warrior profession LV10 or above including apprentices, Colour like yellow sand, a mysterious sword that bears a heavy earth elemental strength. Attributes: Attack+35, Strength+10, Agility+5, 3% chance to add 5 secs of “Petrification”.</p>
<p>[Sand Blade]: Type: Two Hand Sword: Grade: Gold, Equipment Requirements: Any warrior profession LV10 or above including apprentices, Colour like yellow sand, a mysterious sword that bears a heavy earth elemental strength. Attributes: Attack+35, Strength+10, Agility+5, 3% chance to add 5 secs of “Petrification”.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>That’s right, it is gold equipment, the gold equipment that has a god knows how much less chance of appearing than silver equipment. And it’s just perfectly a two handed sword that he can almost use. Finishing looking at the stats for the first sand blade, Ling Chen couldn’t hold it back and started laughing. Even he didn’t think that he would gain a piece of gold equipment at the novice stage. Although after seeing the stats for the second gold equipment he felt a little dazed…</p>
<p>Sand Blade… same name, same stats… it was actually two of the exact same equipment!!</p>
<p>This…</p>
<p>A monster dropping two of the same high-grade equipment at once, this seems to be unheard of.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, right now he possessed two pieces of gold equipment that regular players… even top-tier players couldn’t even dream of.</p>
<p>The only sad thing is that he is still one more step away from LV10, right now he can’t equip any of the stuff.</p>
<p>Although it appears that there weren’t just two pieces of gold equipment. Under his feet, at the place the 2 sand blades used to be, there is also another circle of gold light flickering. It’s just that this circle of golden light is a lot smaller, being squashed under the sand blades causing Ling Chen to not be able to notice it at first glance.</p>
<p>Ling Chen bent his waist and picked it up, this is a chain strung together by golden beads… Should be a bracelet, there are a total of 8 of the golden beads, of the 8, four of them each had a small hole that is the same size.</p>
<p>Could this be… (TL: Yes, yes it is. You don’t need to keep asking could this be when you can figure out in a second and also already know the answer)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And so the wait begins. In the mean time let’s give a drum roll for our new editor….. crosserz! or whatever he wants to call himself! I forgot to ask. Actually I didn’t ask READER either. Anyways recommended book is Ender’s Game. Another very famous book. It is a sci-fi book about a boy saving the world from aliens but not really. Bet you can’t guess the MC’s name. This book also has sequels that I have not read yet, not because I have no interest but because I can’t get my goddamn hands on a copy.</p>
<p>[Gold Vein Chain]: Type: Moon God Bracelet, Grade: Gold. Equipment Requirements: None. High grade moon god bracelet made from golden beads, can be socketed with energy crystals of any grade, cannot be socketed with energy orbs, Sockets: 4.</p>
<p>This is actually a gold grade Moon God Bracelet!!</p>
<p>After entering the Mystic Moon world Ling Chen had encountered Moon God Bracelets for the first time. He was very confident that equipment of this magnitude was very valuable. Equipments, such as the Moon God Bracelets of the same grade are much more valuable than equipment of the same grade or accessories. This was because the equipping of Moon God Bracelets has no level requirements and can be used by all classes. Just this setting alone has determined the rarity of Moon God Bracelets. The effect of the Moon God Bracelet is to add stats through the energy crystals and energy orbs… completely additional stats. And the addition is proportional, this mean that as you get further in the game the additional effects will get stronger. At that time if a player does not have the additional stats from a Moon God Bracelet then they will undoubtedly be thrown far behind by the rest of the players.</p>
<p>Gold Vein Chain is a gold equipment, it can be equipped with 4 energy crystals of any grade. In comparison, the current metal bracelet he is wearing is practically a piece of trash. A Moon God Bracelet that can be socketed with 2 energy crystals and a Moon God Bracelet that can be socketed with 4 crystals, the difference between them is almost the same as having two less pieces of equipment equipped. The Gold Vein Chain and Sand Blade are both gold grade, but without any exaggeration its value cannot be matched by even 100 Sand Blades. He even had reason to believe that even if the average level of players reached LV100, players that would possess a gold grade Moon God Bracelet would still be incredibly few.</p>
<p>He carefully put away the Gold Vein Chain… a priceless artifact, using these two words to describe it is not at all too much. If this Gold Vein Chain were to appear in public, who knows how big of an uproar it would cause.</p>
<p>Two pieces of silver equipment and 3 pieces gold equipment. Ling Chen rubbed his hands a bit excited. Overcoming levels, soloing a Faerie BOSS in itself is an impossible task, naturally the gains are also of a similar level. He swiftly moved forward, going around the Greedy Giant Toad’s corpse in a circle, and picking up the last 3 trophies — A green scroll, a 1 meter wide item that looked like a rag, and a bead emitting a red glow.</p>
<p>[Power Scroll — Avarice Sound Wave]: CC type scroll, after use will release dangerous infrasound waves to disrupt the target’s’ mind, causing all targets within a 50 meter radius to fall into 10 sec. of confusion. Scroll will disappear after use.</p>
<p>Avarice Sound Wave is a scary skill belonging to the Greedy Giant Toad. The effect is far superior to even when the Greedy Giant Toad used it, making all enemies within a 50 meter radius to fall into confusion, moreover lasting for 10 seconds. The degree of scariness is easy to imagine. If it is used in a group battle … 10 seconds of confusion is more than enough to make a large team crumble.</p>
<p>[Dark Cloak of Concealment]: Special item, wearing it will cause the body to enter a “Stealth” state, unable to be discovered by beings of Faerie or below power. It also has a certain chance of escaping from the senses of beings with strength above Faerie level. Cannot attack when stealthed, stealth condition will automatically release when cloak is removed, can be used for a total of 300 seconds. Remaining Time: 300 secs.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>A cloak that can stealth for 300 seconds… Even though it’s not an official cloak equipment, its effect is far more superior to regular equipment.</p>
<p>[Heartless Orb]: Type: Energy Orb, Grade: Faerie. Attribute: Fire, Effect: Critical Hit Rate+15%.</p>
<p>Ling Chen jerked his hand, almost throwing away this orb releasing a fiery red light.</p>
<p>This is an energy orb… it is the incredibly rare energy orb that the Village Chief mentioned that a regular person wouldn’t even be able to see it in a lifetime.</p>
<p>Its effect is to add a whole 15% of critical hit rate!</p>
<p>Adding 15% critical hit rate… this is such an OP stat! So strong that people practically wouldn’t be able to believe it!</p>
<p>The Novice Village Chief said, the power held within an energy orb far surpasses that of an energy crystals. Right now Ling Chen truly felt the strength of energy orbs… An additional 15% critical hit chance, he looked at it again and again, still a bit suspicious of what he is seeing and whether it is real or not. His current critical hit rate is 7%, and as long as he sockets this orb into the Moon God Bracelet, his critical hit rate can reach 22%. At that time out of an average of 5 attacks at least one will be a critical hit. And this is just at the initial stage. After some time once his equipment matures, gathering some equipment that adds critical hit rate will become a certainty. At that time he will be able to activate a critical hit with an average of four attacks, maybe even 3, just thinkin of it is already terrifying.</p>
<p>This is also just Faerie Orb, the lowest grade energy orb. If so, then what kind of unimaginable effects must the Heaven End, Mysterious God, and the seemingly non-existent Saint Destroyer Orbs have.</p>
<p>The only regrettable thing is… energy orbs are not something that all Moon God Bracelets have the qualifications to be socketed with.</p>
<p>The metal bracelet he has on his hand right now cannot equip the Faerie Orb and the Gold Moon God bracelet he just gained also cannot hold such Orbs.</p>
<p>Holding onto the orb for a long time, he still couldn’t settle down the excitement in his heart. Today is his 4th day entering the game, but he has already gained such a powerful item… He felt more and more that even though the process of killing the Greedy Giant Toad was unimaginably difficult, but the rewards were proportional. Heartless Orb of this kind should not be appearing at the current stage, but on the other hand, is a LV10 Faerie BOSS something that player’s at the current stage kill? Don’t mention killing it… being able to fall down the abyss and not die, who can manage that?</p>
<p>The Village Chief said, only Faerie Grade and above Moon God Bracelets can be socketed with energy orbs. Looks like he needs to find a Moon God Bracelet above Gold grade, or else, this Heartless Orb that makes his blood boil will end up becoming a pretty decoration.</p>
<p>Once again checking all of his trophies; Over 300 gold coins, 20 bottles of intermediate potions, 2 pieces of silver equipment, 3 pieces of gold equipment of which includes a priceless Gold Moon God Bracelet, 1 scroll, 1 special item and 1 energy orb. It can be called a scarily huge harvest. Ling Chen walked another circle around the giant toad’s corpse, not discovering anything else. Right when he was about to move towards the entrance to the sixth area, the corners of his eyes suddenly moved, his footsteps stopping.</p>
<p>Staying silent for a little while, he walked to the left side of the corpse, lifting his foot and heavily kicking it over.</p>
<p>Towards the massive body of the Greedy Giant Toad, this kick of his could be considered nothing but scratching an itch. It should not have made its body move an inch… But the Greedy Giant Toad’s corpse clearly being under a very unbalanced condition, with this kick, the corpse actually directly leaned over to the right and then lied back down in a more balanced position.</p>
<p>And at the spot that it used to lay, a glaring silver light reflected into Ling Chen’s eyes.</p>
<p>There is a nearly 2 meter long spear with a body of complete silver!</p>
<p>Ling Chen felt lucky in his heart. Before when he was prepared to leave, he suddenly thought that the Greedy Giant Toad’s body is overly large. In the process of falling down, could it have squashed a portion of the drops under its body? After all, items are dropped at the instant of death, and from dying to entirely falling on the ground the giant toad had used a small period of time. There being the chance that items were dropped first, then the toad fell later, and its body also being overly large, there certainly existed such a possibility… And with a try he really did find another item underneath the toad’s body.</p>
<p>The spear is also a weapon that apprentice warrior’s can use. The attack added by a spear is greater than a two handed swords of the same level and grade. At the same time it has a larger attack ranger, but the spear’s attack speed is the slowest out of all weapons. Besides some super high quality spears or abnormal spears, normal spears all have an attribute that decreases attack speed.</p>
<p>He took a step forward, grabbing the silver spear in his hands… Right at this instant, a system notification suddenly sounded beside his ears:</p>
<p>“Ding… You have gained Faerie equipment ‘Soaring Cloud’, proudly becoming the first player in the world to gain a Faerie equipment. The China region that you are in has become the first war zone for a Faerie equipment to appear. The said event has been logged into the World Hall of Fame. China equipment ranking chart unlocked. Your ‘Soaring Cloud’ is number 1 on the equipment ranking chart. The system will release a global and war zone notice, do you wish to hide your personal information?”</p>
<p>F…Faerie equipment?</p>
<p>His motion of picking up the spear froze. Even with Ling Chen’s strong mind he still could not help himself from directly blanking out at this point.</p>
<p>The system notification rang by his ears twice… He didn’t hear wrong, what the system mentioned is really a Faerie equipment.</p>
<p>A Faerie equipment named “Soaring Cloud”!</p>
<p>This silver spear that he had almost missed, the very one that he is now holding in his hands, is actually a Faerie spear. A Faerie equipment that surpassed silver, surpassed gold, and even in late game was still incredibly rare.</p>
<p>“Ding… The system will release a global and war zone notice, do you wish to hide your personal information?”</p>
<p>Not gaining his answer after a long time, the system had to give another reminder.</p>
<p>“No need to hide it.” Holding the spear called “Soaring Cloud” in his hands, Ling Chen straightened his body responding.</p>
<p>Right away, a resounding notification sound reverberated throughout the entire Mystic Moon world.</p>
<p>“Ding… Global announcement! All players in the world please pay attention, China warzone player ‘Ling Tian’ at 10:09 this morning gained the first Faerie equipment in the entire world. The said event has already been recorded into the World Hall of Fame, China warzone equipment ranking chart unlocked. Player ‘Ling Tian’ gains system reward: Gold: 500, Fame: 500, SP: 200. May all players continue to work hard, creating even more glorious success.</p>
<p>“Ding… Global announcement…”</p>
<p>“Ding… Global announcement…”</p>
<p>“Ding… China warzone announcement, player ‘Ling Tian’ has proudly gained the first Faerie equipment, triggering the condition to unlock the equipment ranking chart, China warzone equipment ranking chart unlocked, players may now look at it.</p>
<p>The first time the global notification sounded, the entire Mystic Moon world fell into a death like silence, and then went into complete mayhem.</p>
<p>Faerie equipment? Someone at this stage gained a Faerie equipment?</p>
<p>Wha, what, wait, how, what, what kind of joke is this!!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>China warzone equipment ranking chart</p>
<p>Rank 1: Soaring Cloud</p>
<p>Type: Spear</p>
<p>Grade: Faerie</p>
<p>Owner: Ling Tian</p>
<p>The newly unlocked equipment ranking only has “Soaring Cloud” all alone written on it. Because only Faerie grade and above equipments have the right to be listed, other equipments below simply do not have the qualifications to be listed. In this moment, the only name appearing on the ranking not only attracted China but the whole worlds attention… because no other country around the world has unlocked the “equipment ranking chart”.</p>
<p>“Faerie… this.. must be…a mistake! How is this possible!</p>
<p>“Holy shit, a Faerie gear! I don’t even have a Bronze grade equipment and some guy actually got a Faerie grade!</p>
<p>“He is called ‘Ling Tian;? How come I never heard of him? His name is not on the ‘Heaven Ranking’ or the ‘Earth Ranking’.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it that Faerie equipment can only be dropped by bosses of at least Faerie grade… The one called “Ling Tian” defeated a Faerie BOSS? How can this be!!! Don’t talk about defeating it, currently there are only an average of not even 2 Lord Bosses in every novice village, how could a Fairy Boss appeared… This kind of super BOSS also shouldn’t be appearing at the Novice Village!”</p>
<p>“Faerie equipment, the niubility is practically god-like… How are we supposed to live!” (TL: Niubility)</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear! The SP rewards, there are 200 Sp as a reward, I am drooling…!”</p>
<p>……….</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>Within one hour, the entire China region was completely flooded with heated discussions. The names of “Soaring Cloud” and “Ling Tian” were also known by countless people. At this stage having a Bronze equipment is already good, having a Silver equipment is enough to have people be killed over in jealousy and hatred, as for gold… if there really is one, those are all cheat level, they are more than enough to blind the eyes of players with their light.</p>
<p>But this time what they heard is… the appearance of a Faerie equipment.</p>
<p>The shock towards their minds was practically like an earthquake. Until now, there are still many players that still didn’t believe their ears, or thought that maybe there is some kind of problem that has appeared in the system. Faerie equipment, at the current stage it’s not a simple piece of equipment, with this piece of equipment in hand, he will have many advantage over normal players. In addition, to be able to kill a Fairy Boss, he must be terribly powerful… or have enormous luck. (1)</p>
<p>“Find information about this ‘Ling Tian’ immediately, give him three choices: join our guild, surrender “Soaring Cloud”… or wait to be killed and robbed!” (2)</p>
<p>“Those on the Heaven Ranking and Earth Ranking usually don’t change their names. Go and investigate immediately about “Ling Tian”, pull him in if possible. If not… just kill him and take “Soaring Cloud”… With Soaring Cloud… I have complete confidence in remaining first on the Level Ranking List, go now! (3)</p>
<p>“Interesting, he doesn’t appear on the Heaven Ranking and the Earth Ranking list, where did this dark horse come from? Humph, I hope that he’s not just all luck. Having another person that is qualified to compete with me is a happy thing… The prerequisite is that you have the qualifications.”</p>
<p>“ A Faerie equipment actually appeared, this is unscientific, Yuan Fang what do you think?”</p>
<p>“Yuan Fang believes there is something strange.”</p>
<p>Well said, according to my judgement, this ‘Soaring Cloud’ is definitely a piece of equipment.” (Sylver: Slow clap)</p>
<p>“Without seeing ‘Soaring Cloud’ young master already knows that it’s a piece of equipment, young master is truly an extraordinary person.”(Reader:…..)</p>
<p>In the 6th area of the Forgotten cave, Ling Chen has become the focus of everyone’s attention, he of course is aware of it. At this stage, not just towards regular players, even towards experts and high ranking guild members, silver equipment is already incredibly alluring, not to mention Faerie equipment. The appearance of this Faerie item will definitely create unrest in the China region for a long time. At the same time it will greatly stimulate the desires of those experts and guilds to seize “Soaring Cloud” …… They know better than anyone what having a Faerie equipment means. If he walks around with ‘Soaring Cloud’ in hand, he estimates there will be a huge army coming to steal it on a large scale.</p>
<p>“Ling…Ling Chen, did you get the Faerie item… “Soaring Cloud” is yours!?”</p>
<p>Yun Feng’s excited voice travelled from the communication device,he repeatedly confirmed the owner’s name of that “Soaring Cloud” on the equipment ranking list… No mistake, it’s Ling Tian!!! It’s Ling Chen’s name in this world.</p>
<p>‘Yes, it’s in my hand’ Ling Chen replied casually.</p>
<p>“Holy shit!!!! You, you, you… “ Yun Feng pauses for a little and roars suddenly: ‘Too awesome, too OP! You are the only one worthy of my admiration! You even got a Faerie item! Normal players can only dream about it! I knew it… if you stay quiet then it’s nothing, but if you make a sound that it will definitely shock the world! HAHAHAHA.</p>
<p>On the other end Yun Fen laughed wildly, as excited as if he was the one with the Faerie item.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: ” …”</p>
<p>‘You are the only one that is able to obtain a Faerie item, I believe you have already surpassed the first ranker ‘Sword Emperor! Er… How did you get it? To have a Faerie drop you must have killed a super BOSS of at least Faerie grade, did you…’</p>
<p>Ling Chen: ”…”</p>
<p>“Cough cough, ff it’s inconvenient then don’t say it.” Not hearing Ling Chen answer, Yun Feng said quickly. After a little pause, he is somewhat puzzled and asked: “Ling Chen, you said that you didn’t want to expose any information, afraid it might affect your life, then why did you make your name know on the equipment list. I remember that you can keep your name hidden… you should know, once your name is exposed, the world will know and remember you, you can’t be at peace later…”</p>
<p>“He,” Ling Chen let out a plain laugh: “ I will not let people know about my real identity, I don’t want the name Ling Chen to be known. But that doesn’t mean ‘Ling Tian’ must be hidden, on the contrary, I want to make sure everyone remembers about this name…until their last day!!!’</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone, Yun Feng let out a gulp…</p>
<p>Three years ago, in Heaven Slaughter, he met Ling Chen for the first time… At that time, if he didn’t get to the Yun Tan Mountain by accident, he would never know that China has an expert that could fight on par against Eve. Ling Chen played only to enjoy the game, his real strength is known only to 2 people, one is Eve, the others is Yun Feng.</p>
<p>And today Ling Chen said…He will not be as secretive as he was before. To enter Mystic Moon, it is not only to keep his promise, but it seems that he also has a goal of his own.</p>
<p>“ The matter with your sister, you can rest assure”.</p>
<p>‘Ah…Okay! I had some doubts, but now I am completely relieved.’</p>
<p>‘And also…Thank you…the 13223 drug is effective!’</p>
<p>In his whole life Ling Chen rarely thanks others, this time he is really sincere. Because this gave hope to Shui Ruo, to save the life of his most important person. Although it’s only 10 years… He believes he can find a way to destroy the Isrock virus completely.</p>
<p>‘… Everything is for our own sisters, there’s nothing to thank. And no matter how you look at it, I’m the one whose gained the greatest benefit. Then, we’ll see each other in the capital city.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen answered and hang up the phone. Just before hanging up he heard an exaggerated scream, “What the fuck! You are already lvl 9!”</p>
<p>[Soaring Cloud]: Type: Spear, Grade: Faerie, Equipment Requirements: Warrior professions including apprentices LV10 or above, Strength&gt;=50. A Faerie Spear as light as a feather, when using it it brings up a series of silver lights that dazzle the opponent. Attributes: Attack+70, Strength+15, Agility+15, Pierce Rate+3%, 3% chance to induce “Blindness” for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Additional Attribute: Parry Judgement: 8. [Note: Parry Judgment will only appear on Faerie and above equipment. Weapons with Parry Judgement have a certain chance of parrying the opponent’s melee attack under the owner’s control (and only melee attacks). As long as you can grasp the Parry Judgement point, you can complete a perfect parry. Generally speaking the longer the weapon, the lower the Parry Judgement, the same goes for the vice-versa. For instance, the average Parry Judgement of daggers the smallest (1-2), the average Parry Judgement for spears is the greatest (this highest it can reach it 10). But, even if it’s spear type weapons with the highest Parry Judgement, perfectly triggering parry is still a very hard. After all, grasping that instantaneous judgement point during intense combat is a practically impossible task. Because of that, parrying is generally treated as a lucky event that has a small chance of triggering.]</p>
<p>Additional Skill: [Shooting Soaring Cloud]: Throw out Soaring Cloud with all your strength, the flying Soaring Cloud will pierce through all enemies in a straight line in front like a shooting star, it also has a certain chance of causing fatal damage, Soaring Cloud that has been thrown out will not automatically return. Effect: Piercing attack in a straight line forward in a 15 meter radius, compulsory hit, 300% attack damage, 1% chance of triggering instant death. HP-50, MP-50, Cooldown Time: 100 secs.</p>
<p>[PS: Skill added by equipment cannot be upgraded]</p>
<p>Grasping the spear in his hand, Ling Chen marveled at the spear. Truly a Faerie equipment, just LV10, and the attack strength that it adds is already a whole 70 points! It is double of the same levelled Sand Blade! The basic attributes points that it adds are a whole 30 points! 3% pierce rate, 3% chance of inducing blindness, not a single one isn’t an attribute that would make people unable to stay calm. Besides that, there is also an additional skill… A powerful ability that completely pwns all of his trainee skills in terms of power. Not only is its damage as high as 300%, it is also a long range, multiple target attack, and it is also forced to hit… Even scarier is, it has a 1% chance of triggering the most scariest condition “Instant Death”!</p>
<p>In comparison, Sand Blade that had wowed him before is practically not fit to be seen.</p>
<p>What made Ling Chen the most thrilled is, this Faerie Spear is very light, even though it’s a spear, it does not add an attribute that lowers attack speed. This kind of spear is very rare, the best of the best.</p>
<p>This is the strength of Faerie equipment. This is also why a Faerie equipment’s attributes can cause a sensation in the entire China warzone. With it in hand, even if Ling Chen threw away all of his other equipment, his overall stats are still enough to leave all of the other players far behind in his dust. At the current novice stage, Faerie equipment should not exist, because its appearance will truly break the balance.</p>
<p>Not to be biased but, SAO/ Log Horizon or Japanese novel with vmmorpg are child play in comparison</p>

<p>Chapter 36: Soul Sacrifice</p>
<p>Touhou Hisouten recommended by masamune. I’ve never played any touhou games or watched the anime but from google images touhou project looks like a major rage quit game.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s experience is now 50% of LV9, only a small distance away from LV10. Once he reaches LV10, then he can equip Soaring Cloud. At that time, his overall strength will increase tremendously.</p>
<p>Playing with the incredibly light spear in his hands for a bit, only then did Ling Chen put it away a bit reluctantly. Scanning around, right when he was about to turn around, his eyebrows suddenly twitched. Standing at the location that he picked up Soaring Cloud, he bent his body looking at the area that the giant toad’s body met with the ground. Right when his head was practically sticking to the ground, he finally saw a black object about the size of his palm. Most of it is on the outside but there is still a small section of it stuck under the toad’s body. This item doesn’t have any radiance, its colour is very similar to the ground’s, adding that the light in here is extremely dim, if it wasn’t for Ling Chen particularly keen eyesight, he pretty much wouldn’t have found it.</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>Extending his arm and grabbing one of its ends, if didn’t feel cold, clearly not made from metal. From the feeling, it actually felt like a kind of hard wood.</p>
<p>His hand grabbing the edge, after trying a couple times, he finally bit his teeth and used all of his strength to pull it out, his body nearly falling to the ground from the backward force.</p>
<p>This is a square, black plate, nothing out of the ordinary. The front of it is flat and smooth, on the other side, he discovered a big, faintly imprinted word… Order.</p>
<p>Slowly, Ling Chen used his hand to tightly grasp it, his eyes flickering an abnormal light.</p>
<p>2 pieces of silver equipment, 3 pieces of gold equipment, one energy orb, one Faerie equipment… and this was not all, in the end there was also this kind of generous gift.</p>
<p>Glancing at the giant toad beside him that had forced him into countless hopeless situations and near the edge of death, he suddenly started to feel that its ugly body was actually really cute.</p>
<p>In the next five minutes, Ling Chen was knocking around and hitting the toad’s corpse, pushing it here kicking it there. Only after he confirmed that there really were no other items did he turn around, looking towards the door leading to the sixth area that had already opened.</p>
<p>The guardian of the 5th area is a LV10 Faerie beast… if the 6th area still has a guardian beast, then it undoubtedly surpasses the Greedy Giant Toad.</p>
<p>Standing at the entrance of the 6th area for a while, he did not feel any dangerous atmosphere coming through, but he still didn’t dare to rashly advance. Right now he had already used all of his special potions, his HP and MP recovery potions also only remained the 20 bottles that the giant toad dropped. Besides that, he didn’t have any other replenishments. Ling Chen furrowed his brows, thinking of different kinds of possibilities that could occur and methods of approach after entering… Suddenly, the corners of his lips twitched, almost not resisting knocking himself on the head.</p>
<p>From the moment he came online, he had always felt like he had forgotten something. Only now did he suddenly remember, after he had exterminated the giant toad, the system seemed to have given a “Unique Item” and a “Unique Skill”.</p>
<p>Ling Chen immediately stopped thinking about the 6th area in front, calling out his backpack… Sure enough in the corner of the backpack there was an extra silver insignia the size of a ping pong ball.</p>
<p>[Consonance Insignia]: Type: Insignia, Grade: None, Equipment Requirements: Exclusive to [Ling Tian], Cannot be traded, a mysterious insignia with an unknown origin, will only be rewarded to the first player to solo a Faerie Beast, the item itself does not possess any attributes. But legends says that it has been passed down from ancient times, it can open a certain ancient ruin.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Insignias, no matter in what virtual game world are always the rarest, and also most valuable, priceless equipment. It’s not to say that the stats of insignias are very strong, but the insignias have an attribute that no other piece of equipment will ever have: That is that there is no equipment limit. Which means that if you have the ability to gain large amounts of insignias, then all of those insignias can be equipped at the same time, the stats are naturally accumulated– Of course, the premise is that you have the ability to gain lots of insignias. Although, it is also because of this special attribute that no other piece of equipment can have, that the rarity of insignias has been directly decided. Insignias cannot be dropped by creatures, instead they appear as a symbol of status or a special reward when you complete some kind of very special task or some kind of great achievement.</p>
<p>What made Ling Chen speechless is that the insignia that he gained actually had no stats.</p>
<p>Can open a certain ancient ruin… This is the line that determined the value of this insignia, and it’s very vague, seemingly real seemingly fake. Furthermore is doesn’t mention any information about the so called “Ancient Ruin”.</p>
<p>Ling Chen could only helplessly put it away, and then open up his skill page, expectantly looking towards the mysterious skill that he gained.</p>
<p>[Soul Sacrifice]: Current Level: : LV1, Highest Level LV4, SP to Upgrade to LV2: 2000, An impasse skill that uses your life and soul as an offering in exchange for the most extreme attack strength. Only people with a strong mind and conviction can unlock and trigger it. After activating HP=1, Physical Attack Strength+100%, Magic Attack Strength+100%, the use of any skill has no consumption (including HP and MP consumption), Duration: 10 secs, and cannot be stopped while in use, cannot use any method of HP recovery. Cooldown Time: 300 secs.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>Increasing attack strength by a whole 100%… how can there exist such a terrifying buff!</p>
<p>Soul Sacrifice, truly worthy of the name of “Impasse Skill”, it is the last struggle that puts one’s life at the edge of death in exchange for the crazy growth of attack strength. An increase of 100% to attack strength is incredibly scary, but during this buff time, HP has to remain at 1 point and cannot be recovered. During this time as long as you are lightly touched by any attack, you will undoubtedly die. Truly an impasse skill that should not be activated unless in a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Even though the price and level of danger in releasing it is very high, but the buff of 100% attack strength is enough to make any player stare tongue-tied.</p>
<p>At the same time the amount of SP required to upgrade Soul Sacrifice to LV2 is high enough to scare a regular player into gaining a mental disease…</p>
<p>It actually needs 2000 whole points of SP!</p>
<p>Working his butt off killing a Faerie BOSS he only gained 1000 SP, just this skill’s first upgrade requires 2000 SP… dare to be even harsher!!</p>
<p>He looked at his current SP: 2500. 300 points from the man-eating toads, 1000 from the Greedy Giant Toad, 1000 from the big reward of soloing the first Faerie BOSS, 200 from the reward of gaining the first Faerie Equipment. These 2500 points are undoubtedly an incredibly big wealth, it’s something that regular players can’t even dream of. He even believed that with this amount of SP, even after changing to an official class he can directly max out some of the skills.</p>
<p>Yet these skill points, are only enough to upgrade Soul Sacrifice to LV2.</p>
<p>Should I put them into Soul Sacrifice…</p>
<p>Soul Sacrifice is a very extreme skill, powerful, but also very dangerous. Even calling it a suicidal skill is not too much. Even if you gave this skill to a regular player for free, they would basically not have the balls to use it. But towards Ling Chen this is truly a terrifying skill. He also wanted to see just how strong it will get after reaching LV2.</p>
<p>After hesitating for a long time, Ling Chen bit his teeth in the end and put 2000 SP into Soul Sacrifice. Right away, under the sound of the system notification, Soul Sacrifice upgraded to LV2.</p>
<p>[Soul Sacrifice]: Current Level: : LV2, Highest Level LV4, SP to Upgrade to LV3: 5000, An impasse skill that uses your life and soul as an offering in exchange for the most extreme attack strength. Only people with a strong mind and conviction can unlock and trigger it. After activating HP=1, Physical Attack Strength+200%, Magic Attack Strength+200%, the use any skill has no consumption (including HP and MP consumption), Duration: 15 secs, and cannot be stopped while in use, cannot use any method of HP recovery. Cooldown Time: 300 secs.</p>
<p>Looking at the attributes of the upgraded Soul Sacrifice, Ling Chen almost let out a gasp.</p>
<p>An upgrade of 1 level, not only made the duration increase to 15 seconds, physical and magical attack buff also directly increased to 200%! Exactly double of what it used to be at LV1! If he activates Soul Sacrifice, his attack power will directly triple! How scary is that!</p>
<p>Ling Chen suddenly felt, the expenditure of these 2000 points is not a waste at all.</p>
<p>As for upgrading to LV3, the amount of SP required is a whole 5000 points. Ling Chen glanced at the number for a second, and then didn’t have the guts to look a second time. Those 2000 or so skill points are from killing a Faerie BOSS plus system rewards on the side. From now on he will be conventionally killing elites and BOSS to accumulate SP, who knows what year and month he will accumulate 5000 points. More so, the professions after job changing have a pile of skills, all needing SP…</p>
<p>Getting Soul Sacrifice to upgrade is going to be a long time away.</p>
<p>Once again standing at the entrance towards the 6th area, Ling Chen took a last look at the giant toad’s corpse before stepping forward, sighing about his encounters in the past few day under the sound of footsteps. A high payout, will be accompanied by a high return., he always believed in this line. Exterminating the Greedy Giant Toad, he can be said to have accomplished an impossible task, and because of that, he gained one after another OP level rewards.</p>
<p>Then, what is hidden in front.</p>
<p>Rumble~~~</p>
<p>Taking his first step in, the stone door like before tightly closed, his retreat, once more being blocked. Ling Chen lifted his gaze looking forward, and then slightly blanked.</p>
<p>What appeared in front of his eyes was not a wide space, but instead a narrow passage.</p>
<p>Passage?</p>
<p>Ling Chen stayed silent for a bit, and then walked forward with light footsteps.</p>
<p>The passage is two meters wide, 2 meters tall, and unexpectedly long. Ling Chen walked for 3 whole minutes before finally reaching the end.</p>
<p>Is in front the 6th area?</p>
<p>Ling Chen made his footsteps as light as possible, slowly moving forward silently. Turning around the last corner of the passage, a large space immediately appeared before his eyes. At the same time, an indescribably immense sense of danger rushed at him from in front, making his body abruptly freeze, even holding back his breath, his entire self as if petrified standing there not moving.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 37: Tao Tie</p>
<p>Last Song by Yamai</p>
<p>The area in front is very big, its width is over 100 meters. The space of this area is completely empty, only in the middle silently rested a massive green coloured beast.</p>
<p>Its resting body covered half of this area’s ground! The size of its body is who knows how many times that of the Greedy Giant Toad’s. Just its gigantic body made Ling Chen have a feeling of suffocation.</p>
<p>This is a massive beast with an incredibly strange and terrifying appearance, right now it is clearly in deep sleep. Its head is enormous, its features so savage that just glancing at it is enough to make people scared. Its mouth is especially big, even though it’s sleeping its mouth is wide open, revealing a line of frightening, saw like teeth. The bridge of its nose bulges out greatly, on top of its head is actually a single, curved horn. At the two sides of its head there is a meat fin, its shape like an ear. What’s bizarre is that there are surprisingly no eyes on its face… The entire face is just an angular nose and a massive mouth that seems to be able to swallow a mountain, along with a pair of ear-like meat fins, nothing else. The appearance of its body and tail are similar to a normal ox, but are a lot bigger. Two massive paws extend out from the two sides of its body… the appearance is a bit similar to the hands of humans. (TL: images)</p>
<p>The indescribably enormous aura came from this massive behemoth. The sense of danger it gives him is more than 1000 times greater than the Greedy Giant Toad.</p>
<p>Drops of cold sweat instantly soaked Ling Chen’s clothes, he stood there staring at the terrifying behemoth, not daring to advance, even not daring to move backwards to hide his body. Instead he stood there completely still, holding in his breath. He understood what this incredibly dangerous sense of danger meant… Just like an ant, facing a towering mountain of which the tip cannot be seen. If the behemoth in front wakes up, it can obliterate him in an instant not even leaving an ash, there isn’t even a slight chance of struggle.</p>
<p>The stronger the creature, the more acute its senses are. The beast has clearly slept underneath this abyss for too long, its alertness also falling to the lowest, because of that he was not discovered when he first entered before. This kind of beast, with every movement of his body there is a higher chance of being discovered.</p>
<p>… But, his path of retreat has been cut off. Besides death there is no other way to leave, no matter what, he can only choose to move forward.</p>
<p>But, fighting with this behemoth, is complete suicide!</p>
<p>Ling Chen shifted his gaze, scanning every corner not covered by the behemoths body. After standing there as if frozen for half a minute, he used the slowest movements to call out the “Dark Cloak of Concealment” and then lightly put it on his body.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have used special item “Dark Cloak of Concealment”, now stealthed, cannot attack while stealthed, taking off the “Dark Cloak of Concealment” will release the stealth condition.”</p>
<p>The Dark Cloak of Concealment’s stealth effect can completely hide from the senses of any being Faerie level and below, it also has a certain chance of escaping from the discoverment of Heaven End and Mysterious God level beings… but without even needing to think it’s easy to know how low this probability is.</p>
<p>But, right now he can only give it a gamble. Hope the awareness of this behemoth has greatly dropped over the years of its slumber… Hope even more that the path forward has not been blocked!</p>
<p>Under the effect of the Dark Cloak of Concealment, Ling Chen’s body completely disappeared from sight, even he could only see a hazy shadow of himself.</p>
<p>Under the effect of the Dark Cloak of Concealment, Ling Chen stepped forward, balancing his body, slowly walking forward almost completely silently.</p>
<p>1 step, 2 steps… 10 steps… 20 steps…</p>
<p>The slumbering behemoth was completely quiet, Ling Chen’s mind also slightly relaxed a bit. Before today, there should have been no outside beings entering this place for a very long time, this behemoth should have also lost its alertness already, sleeping extremely peacefully. Or else, with its strength, even stealthed he would have been discovered at the first moment.</p>
<p>At 10 meters from the beast, Ling Chen finally couldn’t resist, using a “Scan Skill” on the behemoth.</p>
<p>[Tao Tie]: Type: Ancient Mythical Beast, Grade: Mysterious God, Level: ????, other information cannot be detected.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes immediately widened to its limit.</p>
<p>Mysterious… Mysterious God!?</p>
<p>Besides Saint Destroyer beings that only exist in legend, Mysterious God, is already the pinnacle strength of the Mystic Moon world. Regardless if it’s human or beast, if they have Mysterious God level strength, then they have the qualifications to overlook the entire world. Towards players, there is a possibility of defeating a Faerie BOSS, Heaven End BOSS… at late game, with enough people and strength, there is also a possibility of winning. But Mysterious God BOSS will always be impossible to defeat. No matter how high the level, how exaggerated the number of people, it is unbeatable. Even with 100 thousand, 1 million players, it is all the same as going to suicide. Because Mysterious God is a mythical level BOSS, it can only be looked up at, cannot be beat. How can a myth, be broken by players that are at the bottom of the strength hierarchy.</p>
<p>And beasts with Mysterious God level strength even on Forgotten continent are very few, all of them incredibly renowned, feared by humans, worshipped by all beasts.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ling Chen is at the Novice Village area.</p>
<p>And it is exactly this Novice Village… that actually exists a Mysterious God beast!!</p>
<p>The Mysterious God beast’s name is… Tao Tie!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen of course wouldn’t not know Tao Tie this name. In Chinese legend, it was formed from Demon God Chi You’s decapitated head, having the most greedy nature and incredibly terrifying strength. Legend says that its massive mouth can swallow the sky and devour the ground, there is not a single thing in the world it cannot engulf. In previous virtual reality games, Tao Tie this name also regularly existed, and always appears as an unbeatable final BOSS. (TL: Chi You, a very bad man in Chinese legend that tried to take over the world.)</p>
<p>And 《Mystic Moon》’s Tao Tie, unexpectedly appeared in the Novice Village area!!</p>
<p>These kinds of final bosses are all a one time thing, which means that after killed it will permanently die. Unless it is revived, it will not respawn after a certain period of time like a regular BOSS. This Tao Tie is the only one in the Mystic Moon world… It did not appear in the most secret, most frightening, final area that players basically cannot enter, instead it appeared here.</p>
<p>Exactly what is happening!? His heart was filled with disbelief and puzzlement, but right now was not the time for him to be thinking of these things. No matter in which virtual game world the Tao Tie’s identity is that of an evil beast, if Ling Chen wakes it up, his only option is death. He tightly sealed his lips, suppressing his heartbeat and breathing that had become a bit erratic, maintaining his previous actions and step by step walking forward.</p>
<p>30 steps… 50 steps… 100 steps…</p>
<p>A passageway the same size as the one he came here through appeared before his eyes… and there is no stone door blocking it!</p>
<p>This towards Ling Chen was certainly a pleasant surprise. He did not rush in his thrill, instead slowly advancing while maintaining his light and slow movements, and then finally stepping into that passage.</p>
<p>I safely passed just like that?</p>
<p>Stepping into a corner of the passage, making himself completely disappear from the Tao Tie’s range of vision, only then did Ling Chen slowly let out a breath. But that feeling of palpitation would not disappear in a short period of time. Right now he was still shocked about why the Novice Village would actually appear this kind of final BOSS, this simply goes against common sense and common knowledge. Even if you told people about it, there probably wouldn’t be anyone who would believe you. Looking forward, Ling Chen felt incredibly lucky. He knows, he was once again blessed by fortune. The 6th area was not locked, this passage was not blocked by a stone door like the previous ones, or else, even if he can carefully avoid the sleeping Tao Tie’s detection, it would be completely pointless.</p>
<p>“Ding… You are about to enter the 7th area of the Forgotten Cave in front.”</p>
<p>“Ding… The 7th area is the end of the Forgotten Cave, it may be harbouring unknown danger, please advance in caution.”</p>
<p>The next area is the end?</p>
<p>Ling Chen did not release the stealth condition. continuing to use his lightest footsteps to advance, only after walking in the passageway for 100 meters did he take off the cloak… At this moment, the Dark Cloak of Concealment’s 300 seconds time of effect only remained the last 100 seconds. He then quickened his footsteps, rapidly moving forward.</p>
<p>Underneath Wolf’s Cliff at the most eastern point of Novice Village No. 49554, at the bottom of an abyss, a bizarre cave, demonified life forms, an ancient mythical beast guardian… He wanted to know more and more eagerly, exactly what the end of this Forgotten Cave is hiding.</p>
<p>Could it be, this is a final, ultimate hidden quest hidden in Novice Village 49554?</p>
<p>This passageway is a bit longer than the one before, only after walking for 5 minutes did Ling Chen see a change in the light in front… He knows, he is about to reach the end… the end of the passage, and the end of the Forgotten Cave.</p>
<p>Softening his footsteps, Ling Chen took a deep breath, and then activated the recording ability on the communication device on his wrist. Holding his breath, he carefully, step by step walked forward. The 6th area is guarded by an ancient mythical beast, even an idiot should know that something that can be guarded by an ancient mythical beast is definitely not ordinary. Maybe, this is a mysterious ancient ruin and inside harbours countless artifacts and treasures — Of course, this is what Ling Chen wants to see the most. Or maybe, inside lives a powerful hermit, although this kind of possibility is very small, because if there really was a person inside they should have already discovered him when he entered. (TL: Not sure if it’s enter the cave or the passage)</p>
<p>Gradually moving forward, the light became more and more obvious, but from beginning to end Ling Chen did not feel any sense of danger. His tightened heart strings also became more and more relaxed. Continuing to move forward, the light became increasingly stronger, slowly becoming brighter than any other light he’d seen here. Ling Chen slightly paused… At the end of the space, is it filled with light? Or is it, that this passage leads outside?</p>
<p>Right until he stepped out of the passage, a sense of danger still did not arrive. This meant that there are no living beings here. Walking out of the passage, Ling Chen stood there, looking at the space in front filled with blinding light…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 38: Black Crescent Moon</p>
<p>The Palm of a Tiny Hand</p>
<p>This is a space that couldn’t be considered very big. The same walls, but what’s different from the all the other areas is that in the air floated little orbs emitting a light green glow. Ling Chen tried grabbing one with his hand only to discover that these floating orbs don’t have a physical body, but are rather more like glowing air, it’s also these floating orbs that made the light in this place especially bright.</p>
<p>There are no signs of life here, there even doesn’t seem to be any signs of any being having ever lived here. At first glance, this place appears to be a big hall, the hall is very spacious, only a small stone counter in the middle of the grounds. The stone counter is not even half a meter tall, when Ling Chen looked at the counter, a beam of light seemed to have reflected over for a moment.</p>
<p>This place is?</p>
<p>No fabulous treasure, no life forms, even not able to find any special existence, the only thing that can be seen is a spacious hall and the stone counter in the middle of the hall, this was completely different from what Ling Chen expected.</p>
<p>A place guarded by an ancient mythical beast, how can it just have these things!</p>
<p>Staying silent for a bit, he walked forward, heading for the stone counter in the center.</p>
<p>Clack…</p>
<p>His feet seemingly stepping on something, Ling Chen stopped his footsteps. Looking downwards, the ground underneath is uneven, where he stepped faintly appeared the shape of a sword hilt.</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>Ling Chen immediately crouched down, pushing aside the surrounding rocks. Immediately, a complete sword hilt appeared before his eyes. The sword hilt displays a black colour, on top it is faintly ingrained with extremely complex, blood coloured lines. The entire sword hilt is around 30 centimeters long, its thickness is far greater than a regular sword hilt, its appearance is pretty normal though. When Ling Chen stepped on it a large part of it was slumped in the ground which is why Ling Chen didn’t notice it when he scanned the place earlier.</p>
<p>Could there be a sword hidden here?</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s heartbeat immediately started to quicken… A sword that can be hidden here, even without thinking it’s easy to know that this sword in not an ordinary sword. He extended his arm grabbing the hilt, casually lifting it… And then, his face froze.</p>
<p>Under his pull the sword actually didn’t move at all, as if it was embedded in the ground.</p>
<p>Ling Chen slightly furrowed his brows. He adjusted his position, two hands grabbing the sword hilt, and then suddenly biting his teeth, using all of his strength pull upwards.</p>
<p>“Heeeee…”</p>
<p>Under the effort of his full strength, the black sword hilt finally lifted from the ground, but it only stayed in the air for a short two seconds. After only lifting it up for two seconds Ling Chen was no longer able to maintain his grip, the sword hilt once again falling onto the ground with a “Bam”, and then causing the rigid ground to deeply sink down.</p>
<p>That feeling was not like lifting a small sword hilt, but instead like pulling a thousand tonne boulder.</p>
<p>“So heavy… how can anybody use such a heavy sword.” Ling Chen wiped the sweat on his forehead. The instant the sword hilt lifted off the ground, he saw very clearly that this is not a sword, but just a sword hilt, without any blade. Its appearance may be bigger than a regular sword hilt, but it is still only 30 or so centimeters long, a couple centimeters thick, how can an item of this volume be heavy to such a degree, exactly what is it made of?</p>
<p>In addition, why is there just a sword hilt here. Since there’s a sword hilt, there should be a sword blade… Could it be that this is a sword where the blade was broken off?</p>
<p>Ling Chen once again squatted down, composing himself and looking towards its stats.</p>
<p>[Shura Emperor Sword’s Broken Piece 1]: 10 000 years ago, the world famous “Red Mystical Sword King” because of obsession descended into the way of the Shura, becoming the incarnation of a Shura, the Red Mystical Sword that he wielded after being bathed in the blood of countless life forms changed into the [Shura Emperor Sword]. After becoming a Shura, Red Mystical Sword King’s nature disappeared, from then on his only reason for living was to slaughter, massacring the lives of countless beings, causing the world to fall into chaos. In the end bringing onto himself the punishment of the heavens, befalling the combined judgement of Saint Destroyer beast Void Dragon God and the three goddesses Fate, Order, Liberty, in the end dying under the hands of the 3 goddesses. The 3 goddesses wished to completely destroy the [Shura Emperor Sword] but were unable to, they thus broke it into 5 pieces, scattering them into 5 different directions, making them unable to come back together for eternity.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Shura… Emperor… Sword…</p>
<p>This sword hilt is one of the pieces of the Shura Emperor Sword that the 3 goddesses broke?</p>
<p>Who Red Mystical Sword King is, he didn’t know. The concept of a Shura, he also only had a vague idea, only knowing that Shura’s represent arrogance, heartlessness, and bloodlust. But, the Red Mystical Sword King that changed into a Shura actually needed a Saint Destroyer beast and the 3 goddesses to act out judgement together…</p>
<p>What kind of power is that!!</p>
<p>Red Mystical Sword King must have already become a long ago legend… or maybe, 10000 years of time has already passed, maybe on Forgotten continent there doesn’t even exist a person that remembers his name. But… Ling Chen placed his hand on the sword hilt… the sword used by Red Mystical Sword King, is also definitely undoubtedly powerful to an unimaginable degree!</p>
<p>Shura Emperor Sword, is very likely a heavenly item, maybe even a godly item… just its name is revealing a dominating pressure and overpowering sense.</p>
<p>“He!!”</p>
<p>Both hands exerting force, finally lifting it up again, and then quickly putting it his bag when it was completely in his hands.</p>
<p>This is one of the 5 broken pieces of the Shura Emperor Sword… If, by chance there is a day where I can collect all five pieces… will there be a chance to reforge the Shura Emperor Sword?</p>
<p>Strength that requires a Saint Destroyer beast and the 3 goddesses to face… This Shura Emperor Sword produced an irresistible attraction to Ling Chen. Even if he knows that this Shura Emperor Sword isn’t a good sword, but instead a sword of absolute evil that is drenched in blood and sin.</p>
<p>Successfully putting the Shura Emperor Sword broken piece in his bag, Ling Chen continued walking forward. Before he clearly saw that there seemed to be something at the center of the stone counter. Its reflecting light also flashed at his eyes.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps was particularly clear in this overly quiet space, Ling Chen walked in front of the stone counter and stopped his footsteps. This is a smooth stone counter, it should have existed here for a very long time, but strangely the stone counter doesn’t have a speck of dust on it and is as bright as a mirror. Only in the center is placed a standing black ring.</p>
<p>This ring is…</p>
<p>Ling Chen did not rashly use his hands to touch it, instead bending his waist, examining it from a closer distance, only then discovering that this is not a standard ring. Tts size is about double of the metal bracelet he is wearing, one side is about 1 centimeter thick, and then from the thickest part it starts to become thinner on both sides, when it spreads to the opposite side of the thickest part, it’s already become a thin, almost unseeable line. At first glance, it seems as though an opening has appeared.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the cross section, it’s like a crescent moon at the beginning of the new moon cycle. A black new moon.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s looked at it from a different angle, looking at it from the side… This ring has a width of almost 2 centimeters, at the thickest position, there are three holes of the same size closely together, at the two sides, there are also a series of small holes evenly spreading across… Ling Chen counted the holes, from the thickest to thinnest place, the two sides are each distributed 6 holes, along with the 3 at the thickest area… There are a total of 15 holes.</p>
<p>Holes?</p>
<p>This made Ling Chen unable to help but think of Luna Chains. Luna Chains also have holes spread out on them, and this black crescent moon shaped ring can also be worn as a bracelet. Although Ling Chen was just randomly thinking about it. Of course he wouldn’t think that this is a Luna Chain. The Village Chief said that the strongest Luna Chain that appeared on Forgotten continent had seven slots, which also means that seven is already the limit… No matter what the 15 holes of this black crescent moon can’t have anything to do with Luna Chains.</p>
<p>But something that can be placed here is definitely not an ordinary item.</p>
<p>What exactly is this…</p>
<p>Focusing his eyes, Ling Chen lowered his head looking towards its stats:</p>
<p>????:????</p>
<p>The information that came from his head made Ling Chen a bit dazed. This black new moon is clearly in front of his eyes, yet he cannot see any attributes.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<p>Could it be that it has an attribute to hide its information, only its owner can check it out?</p>
<p>At once, Ling Chen extended his hand, grabbing towards the black crescent moon shaped ring, his fingers, under a slow movement touched the side of the ring.</p>
<p>BUZZ~~~~</p>
<p>Right at the instant when Ling Chen touched the crescent moon ring, a mass of incredibly dark light suddenly released from the crescent moon ring, like night had suddenly descended, instantly covering all of the light in this space. Ling Chen’s pupils immediately enlarged, the world abruptly changed, the world of light before turning into complete darkness in an instant. This is a darkness without any impurity, without any light, a terrifying darkness. Since he was just a child he had experienced so much darkness, countless days of complete darkness, but he never knew, that the colour black could actually be so deep, so thoroughly black.</p>
<p>What’s going on??</p>
<p>What’s happening!?</p>
<p>The black crescent moon that his fingers touched disappeared, following the senses of his right hand, making him feel like it floated up on its own, and then quickly passing through his hand, tightly binding onto his right hand wrist…</p>
<p>“Ding… Your Luna Chain ‘Metal Bracelet’ has been completely destroyed by an unknown force, completely disappeared.”</p>
<p>“Ding. Your energy crystal ‘Beginner Critical Crystal’ has been destroyed completely destroyed by an unknown force, completely disappeared.”</p>
<p>“Ding. Your energy crystal ‘Beginner Strength Crystal’ has been destroyed completely destroyed by an unknown force, completely disappeared.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>What’s going on? Who can tell me what is happening?</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s left hand rapidly grabbed toward his right wrist, sure enough the metal bracelet that was socketed with 2 energy crystals had disappeared. On his right wrist, what he is currently wearing is another ring shaped item… Its shape, is clearly that crescent moon shaped black ring!</p>
<p>“Ah!!!!!!”</p>
<p>At the same time, a feeling of pain as if being cut by a thousand blades came from the depths of his consciousness, making his body abruptly freeze, his mouth letting out a scream of incredible pain…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“AH!!!!”</p>
<p>The sudden pain made Ling Chen instantly feel as though he’d fallen into hell. Pain from his body, no matter to what degree he is able to withstand it, not allowing himself to let out a single sound, but the pain that descended upon his body, is from his mind! As if countless needles, countless sharp knives are stabbing and cutting at his soul, that kind of pain is 10, 100 times more cruel than being cut into pieces or being pulled apart by five horses… Ling Chen’s hands held onto his head, howling in pain, his body slowly fell onto the stone counter, no longer able to stand from the pain. (TL: Chinese death penalties in the past)</p>
<p>What is this!! Who can tell me exactly what is happening…</p>
<p>Why does my mind hurt so much… so much that I feel like it’s going to rip apart and be ground into pieces…</p>
<p>Exactly what is happening!!!</p>
<p>The feeling of pain continued, furthermore it is slowly becoming stronger with every second, making Ling Chen’s screams of pain increasingly shrill. This is clearly a game world, it is a virtual game world where bodily pain has been eased to the lowest, where all senses have been adjusted to the most comfortable condition! Why is there such a feeling of pain!! What is making me in pain… what wants to destroy my mind!!</p>
<p>“Aiya, hee, after being quiet for so many years, a person has finally come here. Thinking about it, it seems like I’ve already slept for a very long time… Hm? How is it a little brother that is this young and doesn’t seem to be very strong?”</p>
<p>In extreme pain, Ling Chen’s mind suffering from a hell-like torture suddenly heard a voice.. a woman’s voice!</p>
<p>This voice gave off the feeling as though it came from the heavens, when it reached his ears, it actually made Ling Chen who was suffering from extreme pain feel numb, as if even his bones had softened a bit. Because this voice is honestly too lovely, just hearing this voice you will truly understand the true meaning of gentle and lovely. Just a few short notes, yet they are practically about to pull out your soul, as if having a magic that can stimulate the nerves of the entire body of men, even women… and their desires.</p>
<p>He difficulty turned his face, using his about to collapse consciousness to control his eyes and look towards the source of the voice… The world before his eyes is so dark, a darkness without any light. This kind of darkness, he should not be able to see anything, but, the figure of a woman clearly reflected into his eyes, allowing him to clearly see her body and face, as if her body was completely isolated from this world of darkness.</p>
<p>The instant he saw her, Ling Chen’s eyes that are filled with pain appeared a moment of sluggishness</p>
<p>That is indeed a woman, a woman of seemingly 20, 30 years of age, yet seemingly also not yet 20. She floated in the darkness, staring at him in interest. Where Ling Chen ‘s gaze fell upon, is a stunning face that is enough to mesmerize the world. Her exquisitely beautiful face, skin white as snow, slightly pursed pink lips that are like a fresh petal, arched eyebrows and stunning eyes revealing an endless charm, making the heart’s of people sway with just a glance.</p>
<p>A body of black clothes like the night, however slightly tight on her body, closely sticking to her proud chest and buttocks, her perky breasts and butt all vividly portrayed. At her waist a black ribbon lightly tied, drawing out a slim waist, accentuating the beautiful form of her body, displaying a perfect S shape, anyone who took a glance would be unable to shift their gaze, they would all be completely stunned.</p>
<p>This is an alluring woman, without any actions she emitted a dream-like graceful beauty and a charming enchantment that is enough to make the world’s men go crazy. Even Ling Chen… who is still under a condition of pain where his mind is practically about to collapse, when seeing her, uncontrollably let his heart sway, unable to believe that the world actually existed such a woman that can emit such an enchanting aura.</p>
<p>“Who… are… you!!”</p>
<p>He bit his teeth, using an unbelievably surprising will to make himself not let out sounds of pain, difficulty squeezing out three words through the gaps of his practically crushed teeth. Before entering here, he is certain that there are no other life forms here… This woman, who is she? Could it be that she was here the whole time?</p>
<p>Hearing his question, the woman’s lips slightly perked. With this smile, her face that was already enough to enchant the world became even more bewitching, an indescribable seductiveness appearing.</p>
<p>“Heehee, suffering from the spirit devourment of Lunar Scourge and still able to speak, you’ve really made this big sister astonished. Aiya, such a handsome little brother, big sister really can’t bear to watch you become a sacrifice, but, it’s you who touched Lunar Scourge yourself. Even if big sister wanted to save you, big sister has no way ne, big sister can only watch you become the sacrifice for Lunar Scourge, hee… Being here for so many years, the outside world should have already forgotten about us, it has indeed reached the time for us to resurface.”</p>
<p>The sound of that voice is not delicate like a young girl’s, it is both mellow and quite lazy, sweet and agreeable but also carrying a natural proudness and seductiveness, making Ling Chen’s heart involuntarily sway, his soul as if wanting to leave his body, following the voice and leaving.</p>
<p>If this woman was born in troubled times, she would definitely be a temptress that could ruin a country, even a dynasty with her every frown and smile.</p>
<p>“You…”</p>
<p>Who this woman is, he doesn’t know. Lunar Scourge… Is it, the black coloured new moon that is tightly bound to his right wrist?</p>
<p>The pain that I am suffering, is from its devourment? Devourment… it wants to engulf and destroy my mind?</p>
<p>And then, become its offering!?</p>
<p>Exactly what has happened!?</p>
<p>This is clearly a game world, why is this feeling of my soul being sliced and feeling of pain so realistic and intense.</p>
<p>If the mind is destroyed… Then, you are either controlled by another person’s mind, forever becoming a puppet, or you lose all consciousness and become a zombie that has life but no consciousness.</p>
<p>The feeling of engulfment my mind is bearing is not fake… In the beginning what enters the game is the player’s mind? This item called the “Lunar Scourge”, it distinctly wants to devour my mind!</p>
<p>Ling Chen used all of his conviction and will, his struggle becoming more intense in an instant… His forehead and body is covered in droplets of sweat, as if just having experienced a rain storm.</p>
<p>“Oh?” Ling Chen’s suddenly strong resistance made the woman slightly surprised, following that the corners of her lips slightly curved, small ripples appearing in her enchanting eyes: “Little brother, resisting like that will bring about an even scarier punishment from Lunar Scourge ne.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!”</p>
<p>Right after the woman’s voice finished speaking, Ling Chen’s mouth let out a miserable, gut-wrenching cry that was like it came from hell. His body could no longer maintain even a squatting position, holding onto his head and rolling on the ground in pain. Where his body rolled to, the ground would be completely soaked from his flying sweat.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhh…”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>“AH————-”</p>
<p>His cries of pain became increasingly shrill, to the point that even the most cruelest person would be unable to continue listening. The shrill cries of this degree virtually made people unable to imagine exactly what kind of pain he is suffering. His body and face are all completely twisted, twisted to a terrifying degree, his shrill voice also becoming increasingly hoarse…</p>
<p>The woman watched him rolling on the ground in pain with a light smile, listening to the miserable shouts beside her ears that are like they came from hell. And yet, her face of unrivaled beauty did not have any hint of sympathy, instead looking like she is admiring a pleasing scenery. She smiled lightly, letting out a voice as soft as the wind:” Little brother, the consequences of struggling are very scary. Right now, you just need to quietly close your eyes, relax your mind, let yourself fall asleep, then there will be no more pain. Come, listen to big sister’s words, stop resisting, relax your mind, and then you can peacefully sleep, there won’t be any more pain.”</p>
<p>“AH——–”</p>
<p>The gut-wrenching screams of pain continued, so shrill that even the air is faintly trembling.</p>
<p>As long as I relax my mind and sleep… there will be no more pain… I can obtain relief…</p>
<p>As long as I fall asleep, I will no longer need to suffer this pain that is 1000, 10000, countless time more terrifying than death…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>No!! If my mind crumbles and is devoured… I will become a puppet, become a living corpse!!</p>
<p>At that time, who will take care of Ruo Ruo!! She only has me by her side, her body is so weak, how can she continue to live without me!</p>
<p>I don’t want to sleep… Nobody can even think about destroying my mind!!!</p>
<p>Nobody!!!!</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhh!!”</p>
<p>AH————”</p>
<p>One whole minute passing by, Ling Chen’s distressed cries have already become scarily hoarse. He no longer has the strength to roll around, his body painfully twitching on the ground, the the roars of pain did not stop. His body is shrouded by a black mist, but the entire time it has been unable to intrude into his brain and body.</p>
<p>The black clothed woman’s smile finally became stiff, her charming eyes narrowing, an imperceptible touch of shock flashing across in the depths of her eyes.</p>
<p>This kind of torture, just a few short seconds is enough to make a regular person completely fall apart. That kind of pain, has already surpassed the thresholds of what a human can bear. Even if your will is unbelievably strong, your mind would simply be unable to bear it, it would be crushed in an instant.</p>
<p>Yet an entire minute has passed by and he is still struggling, resisting, not even a sliver of Lunar Scourge’s soul force is able to penetrate.</p>
<p>How can there be a human whose spirit is so strong to such a degree!! This person…</p>
<p>Her red lips opening, the lovely voice slowly coming out: “Little brother, what you’re doing is not good. No matter how tenacious you are, you can not defeat Lunar Scourge. Like this you will only suffer even more pain ne.”</p>
<p>The moment she finished talking, she suddenly saw the convulsing Ling Chen’s cries of pain stop, he… slowly opened a pair of eyes wet with sweat… The black clothed woman’s gaze abruptly shook.</p>
<p>“You… will never… be able… to imagine… the.. pain… and torture… that… I’ve suffered… Those sufferings… and tortures… not a single time could they destroy my body and mind…”</p>
<p>“This bit of pain…. is nothing!!!!!”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhhhh!!”</p>
<p>A light shock suddenly occurred in the dark world, the black clothed woman’s expression abruptly changed.</p>
<p>Ling Chen eyes at this moment strangely became a red-black colour, his thoughts also returning to that past that he should have forgotten in this turbulent world of darkness…</p>
<p>A little note for what it should sound like in your head when this black clothed woman and Shui Ruo speak. This woman should sound like those older woman in anime/manga that always go “ara ara” and are always trying to tempt the MC. Shui Ruo the way she speaks in you head should be like a little girl speaking to her beloved brother. Kind of like like Miyuki except less obsessive, a younger tone and more confidently without any shyness. Although this changes in the future.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>An unknown isolated island, a place called “Heaven”.</p>
<p>“Oh! My dear HELL, I welcome you to ‘Heaven’. I believe that this time you will continue to bring me surprises.” A hunched old man as thin as a stick, wearing a white lab coat and white rimmed glasses turned around. Using the words skin and bones to describe him could not be more fitting. Especially his head, it is practically no different from a skeleton’s, but the pair of old eyes behind the white rimmed glasses radiated a terrifying glow like that of a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>Behind him is placed one after another 1 meter wide, multiple meters tall cylinder shaped vessels. Inside they are filled with or green, or blood red, or deep blue fluids. Countless tubes and circuits connecting them… And within each vessel, is reflected the figure of a person… That’s right, people! From their body figures, they are also one after another undeveloped children.</p>
<p>“This time it really is a surprise.” A tall black clothed man threw the ragged clothed boy in his hand onto the ground. The boy looked only 8 or 9 years old, being thrown on the ground he did not move, his breathing could virtually not be felt, his condition as if dead.</p>
<p>“Hoho, it’s actually a person that has contracted the Isrock virus…” The white clothed hunched old man saw this boy’s situation with just a casual glance: “Ohohoho! Hatred! I feel hatred from his body! So young and yet able to release such a deep-rooted hatred. My dear HELL, you have indeed given me a surprise, because this is exactly what I need. Coldness and hatred, are what a top-tier killing machine need to have the most. Although, only hatred is not enough, 1309 of the 1352 children that you’ve brought over the years have already died from my experiments, just how long can he last. Trash, do not have the qualifications to become one of my great works.”</p>
<p>“Humph, he is infected with Isrock and was buried alive by his family. Two days later I dug him out, he was still alive. I believe that his willpower will not disappoint you.” The tall man gave a cold snort saying: “Why don’t you cure his Isrock first.”</p>
<p>“Humans really are stupid animals, not even able to deal with a little Isrock virus.” The hunched old man walked over grabbing the little boy’s arm, casually throwing him into one of the big containers filled with green fluid, and then not giving him another glance: “3 minutes later, all of the Isrock virus in his body will die. The vitality of this kind of small virus is practically as fragile as an ant’s.”</p>
<p>“Humans are stupid animals? Are you not a human?” The tall man said coldly.</p>
<p>“Hoho! My dear HELL, please do not put me on par with those foolish humans, this for me is a great insult. How can those insignificant humans compare to me, Dr. Maniac that is about to become a god. Oh, of course, those foolish humans does not include you, because you are the god amongst humans. Humans in your eyes are as insignificant as ants.” The hunched old man pushed his white rimmed glasses, glancing at the boy immersed in green fluid, his eyes flickering a cold light that made the hearts of people feel cold: “Those 1352 children are all geniuses that you selected from all over the world, they are indeed gifted… But, there were only 200 that could endure up to 3 times the spiritual shock and not go brain-dead, and only 43 that endured until the current 5 times spiritual shock… Oh, no no, right now it’s 44, what kind of surprise will they bring me. Then, this child that you brought today, let’s start him off from 5 times.”</p>
<p>“5 times? Have you gone crazy!?” The tall man knit his eyebrows: “These 43 have only endured until now by slowly becoming accustomed to the slowly increasing spiritual shock strength. Starting at 5 times right away, there simply is not a single person that can withstand it.”</p>
<p>“NONO, my dear HELL. You need to know, what I need are real geniuses. To become my product, it is necessary to be able to bear 10 times the spiritual shock and bodily pain and not have the mind collapse, especially not die. I do not need trash.”</p>
<p>“Humph, do whatever you want.” The tall man did not speak anymore, turning around and leaving. He is disgusted with the smell here, or to be more precise, he is disgusted with everything here.</p>
<p>“My dear HELL, Heaven always welcomes your arrival.”</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=[,,_,,]:3</p>
<p>“Blargh!!!”</p>
<p>“Awake, he is still wide-awake. Directly bearing that 5 times spiritual shock that surpasses a regular human’s limit and is actually still awake! Genius… This is the genius that I’ve always desired!”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha… very good! You will be like the rest of my genius text samples, going to bear higher intensities of spiritual shock… Go savour to your heart’s content the wonderfulness and pleasure of Heaven, hahahaha! If one day you have the qualifications to become my work, that will be the greatest honour of you life, hahahaha…”</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=[,,_,,]:3</p>
<p>“My dear HELL, I welcome you to ‘Heaven’. Oh, this time you come empty handed, that really makes this scientist very disappointed.”</p>
<p>“You think that geniuses are very easy to find? Out of 10000 people it is hard to find one person that reaches your minimum requirements. I came because I want to know, how many are still alive? I don’t want my effort from all these years, to only gain a pile of dead bodies!”</p>
<p>“Keke, my dear HELL, you have come at just the right time. Because right now the amount of people living, is only 2.”</p>
<p>“2?”</p>
<p>“When the spiritual shock was increased to 6 times, only the last 7 test samples remained, when it increased to 7 times… Kekekeke, there were only 2 alive! Hahahaha… At first I thought all of their minds would be destroyed, and then be turned into mincemeat by me, who knew that there would actually be 2 still alive. My dear friend, this is your credit, you have given me two real geniuses.” (TL: The mincemeat here could be referring to turning their minds into mush, or their bodies or both)</p>
<p>“Which two?”</p>
<p>“He, they are number 17 and number 1353.”</p>
<p>“Those two?”</p>
<p>“These are the highest grade test samples that only appear every few thousand years. I can no longer bear for them to die… No, not only can I not allow them to die, I will use all possible methods to allow them to live well. And then, I will bit by bit increase the strength of the spiritual shock. First make them completely accustomed to 7 times spiritual shock, and then start to increase it from 7 times, continuing to increase it until the critical point where they are about to completely break, and then allow them to harden themselves from the spiritual torture, until they become accustomed, and then continue to increase it again, from 7 times to 8 times, and then from 8 times to 9 times, from 9 times increasing it to 10 times… Kekekeke, just like that bit by bit, making them evolve into monsters among humans! Becoming my greatest works!! Kekekeke…”</p>
<p>“You really are a maniac. I believe that you should know better than anyone else how great the torture they will bear in this process.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your praise, my dear friend. Don’t worry, I will not forget the promise. After all, I can use electric waves to stimulate their minds and use drugs to strengthen their bodies, but only you, can teach them this world’s most terrifying killing techniques.”</p>
<p>“Three years later, I will return.”</p>
<p>“My dear HELL, Heaven always welcomes your arrival. I believe that the next time you return, you will see the two most outstanding products.”</p>
<p>In a gloomy hall, there are erected two massive glass apparatuses, inside they are filled to the top with green fluid. Two tender bodies float within, only blurry figures can be seen under the cover of the green fluid… along with innumerable thick tubes stuck into their bodies.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=[,,_,,]:3</p>
<p>“My dear HELL, I welcome you to ‘Heaven’. Not seeing you for 3 years, the smell of blood on your body is still so intoxicating. Then, let me guess how much human blood you’ve been stained with these past 3 years.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me your nonsense, you know my reason for coming here, how are your works?”</p>
<p>“Kekekeke, believe me, you will definitely receive a most satisfying answer. Under my drugs, their bodies have become even scarier than a monster’s. Their minds… Kekekeke, their minds can currently withstand 15 times spiritual shock, hahaha… You did not hear wrong, it’s 15 times! Even I am scared by this result to the point that my entire body is shaking. That’s right, when I saw this result, my entire body was shaking. I actually felt fear, me, this Dr. Maniac am actually startled to the point that I feel fearful of my own work…. Right now their spirits are too terrifying. If they then go through the teachings of you, this monster, they will become the entire world’s most terrifying killing machines, the most frightening monsters! I cannot imagine, who horrifying of a nightmare their enemies will face. I believe, after they leave here, the entire world will tremble in fear because of them. And they, are all my work, kekekeke.”</p>
<p>“Humph! You’re not afraid that these killing machines will have a day where they kill their puppeteer?”</p>
<p>“Keke, my dear HELL, you can entirely relax about this point, how can I, Dr. Maniac make this kind of most idiotic mistake. Only if their minds have the ability to bear 20 times the spiritual shock and not break, or else the mental control that I’ve set on them is something that they will never be able to break. They will forever follow my any order, even until death they will never betray me. My dear HELL, could it be that you think that their minds are strong enough to bear 20 times of spiritual shock?”</p>
<p>“20 times? Humph, even a god cannot do that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. So, they will be forever under my control, they will never do anything that you don’t want to see.”</p>
<p>“No need for any more nonsense, bring them out to see me. It has already reached our agreed time.”</p>
<p>“Keke, my dear HELL, you are the person that understands me the most, you should know that I never break a promise with a friend. Then… No.17, No.1353, come out and take a look at your new friend… Oh, no, he is your old friend, it is him, that brought you guys to this beautiful Heaven. From today onwards, you guys will leave Heaven. Kekekeke, prepare to cry and shout, beg, and struggle… Because, the place that he is about to take you guys, is a true hell.”</p>
<p>“…No.17 and No.1353, they don’t have official names?”</p>
<p>“Names? Kekekeke, a very good suggestion, how can my most greatest works not have names. They are life that I created, they are the most greatest works of me., this person that is about to become god, their names–”</p>
<p>“Adam… Eve…”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Ahhh—-”</p>
<p>“Ah———”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhh!!!!”</p>
<p>The agonizing roar did not grow any weaker, in fact the pain grew with each cry. Ling Chen’s every roar would immensely shake this black space. Fear grew on the face of the women clothed in black, even her eyes carried a hint horror.</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge….was trembling!</p>
<p>It’s strength was unable to conquer and invade his spirit, this human’s spirit was not only struggling and resisting…. this human now was also retaliating against it, trying to break its control!!</p>
<p>Impossible…How could such a thing happen!? This is absurd!!!</p>
<p>How could there be anyone in this world that could resist the power of Lunar Scourge!! This was an item that can even make the demon gods fear it.</p>
<p>“Ahhhh———-”</p>
<p>Once again this black space trembled, it was swayed with a shock that was stronger than ever before. Suddenly a ray of light came within this black space, almost as if there was a thin crack inside this darkness.</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge….was being defeated!!</p>
<p>The women clothed in black could not believe what was happening. This young man’s strength was nothing but weak. If not for the fact that he is the only person to arrive at this space for so many years, Lunar Scourge would even find it disdainful to swallow his spirit and turn him into it’s puppet. But this weak human survived it’s power and was struggling under the immense pain. This entire time he has never given in, never collapsed and he never showed even a hint of retreat. His resistance only grew stronger….</p>
<p>This has never happened before…. Any living being that Lunar Scourge wants to conquer, no matter it be gods or demons, will never be able to resist it!</p>
<p>How can this mere human….</p>
<p>Even if the strength of Lunar Scourge was weakened by the dispersement of the three Saint Orbs and the twelve God Orbs, it’s strength was not a level that a mere human could handle!! The result of Lunar Scourge being unable to conquer this human was one that she knew of—-if it can not defeat its target , then it’s strength will be crushed, then….</p>
<p>It will be conquered by this human!!</p>
<p>The horror on the face of the black clothed woman grew as she thought of this. At this moment, she began to reevaluate this human whose face was being so distorted by pain that it no longer looked young. He was twenty years of age, with a hardened face and cold set eyes, but there was nothing else about his appearance that she deemed noteworthy. His strength could not even be part of the weakest of tiers and his equipment was just as worthless. This human that looks incredibly plain, one could even say insignificantly small…</p>
<p>Why does he possess such a terrifying spirit that can contend with Lunar Scourge!!</p>
<p>This human… What is he! Is he really just a normal human being? Or is his appearance just a lie!!</p>
<p>“AHHHHH!!!”</p>
<p>BAM!!!!</p>
<p>This black space shook again and more light came in. The black clothed women looked at Lunar Scourge….The black aura it emitted was being diminished little by little….</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge….was being defeating….it was trembling and retreating. It actually lost!!</p>
<p>How could such be a thing be allowed to happen!</p>
<p>A sweet intoxicating scent gently blew past the tip of Ling Chen’s nose. The black clothed women stood in front him, she was only five steps away from him. As she opened her red lips a sweet voice that could captivate this whole world came out of her mouth : “Little brother, do you really want to resist? Why don’t you obediently listen to this big sister and go to sleep….when you sleep, all the pain will go away.”</p>
<p>“Ah————-!”</p>
<p>“Little brother, look over here….look into big sister’s eyes….”</p>
<p>Her voice carried a devil like seduction, as the spirit of Ling Chen was enduring this immense pain, he subconsciously lifted his head and glanced towards the black clothed women. As she came closer to him, he could more clearly see her face. And in that one glance, he was completely frozen with awe, her face carried absolute beauty. It clearly won over the young Shui Ruo who was still a fresh sprout. From her face, he could tell there exists a sultry allure that was carved deep into her bones. This enticement could not be faked, and it could not be covered. This was a temptation that drew out one’s very soul and incited one’s lust to the very apex. Pretty girls could be found anywhere, but to have such irresistible appeal was something Ling Chen has never heard or seen of before.</p>
<p>This was a beauty that could bring disaster to countries.</p>
<p>In the single moment that she caught Ling Chen’s attention, she displayed a small seductive smile and glistening eyes, while slightly biting her red lips. Using a pair of soul inducing eyes, she revealed an absolutely alluring glance. She slowly strode forward, closing the distance between her and Ling Chen. And as she walked, the black cloth wrapped around the curving lines of her voluptuous body, causing her already sensuous figure to be even more enticing.</p>
<p>The black clothed women walked till she was only half a step away from Ling Chen. At such a close distance, her sensuous curves were even more visible, tempting him as a considerably sized buxom caught his sight, making him unconsciously focus his attention onto her. And in one flash, the pain from Lunar Scourge increased. Similarly, the smile on the black clothed women grew, her eyes looked as if they were covered in a light mist carrying an enchanting glance while she stared sweetly at him: “Little brother, say, do you think that…. big sister is pretty?”</p>
<p>This was the voice of a devil, a devil like women. Within all the women that Ling Chen has seen, there were none that could compare to the mesmerizing curves of her body. Her buxom perked up high against the black cloth, seeming to almost burst the seams of her robe, one could only imagine what laid underneath. The round curve displayed by the the black skirt of her robe also led to entice only more attention the the bounce and softness of the butt below. And at her was midsection was a thin ribbon that brought out an ever so slender waist. Her whole figure was presented underneath the black robe, revealing a allure that neither gods nor demons could resist.</p>
<p>You demon….witch!!</p>
<p>Under such an immense pain, he should not be able to divert any effort or attention to anything else. However his eyes were no longer under his control, they were completely glued to the black clothed women, and could not leave the sight of her figure. His will, spirit, and faith….were all starting to slowly dissolve ….and on the other side, the pain of the strength of Lunar Scourge was intensifying.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh————-!”</p>
<p>The pain never stopped, but along with this soul crushing pain, he was now also facing the test of temptation. The ultimate culmination of pain and the pinnacle of seduction….cause the stress on his spirit to crumble. He cried roars of pains, using the his uttermost most effort to try to close his eyes.</p>
<p>“NO….ONE….WILL….EVER….DESTROY….MY….SPIRIT!!!”</p>
<p>BAM!!!</p>
<p>The dark aura emitted by Lunar Scourge continued to diminish, more light began to leaked into this dark space, and this time it carried the sound of something cracking.</p>
<p>Once again horror flashed past the black clothed woman’s eye, the strength this young man’s spirit surpass her evaluation. As unease flickered past her eyes, she began to lightly bite her lips.</p>
<p>Following the sound of fabric ripping, the black cloth she was wearing began to gently slide off the curves of her body towards her feet. What was left on her body was just a light veil of a half transparent black silk. However, this semi translucent veil clung more delicately onto her figure, completely displaying her sensuous curves, even slightly revealing a tender red in front faint white of her breast. In this brief alluring bit, this image was enough to instantly bewitch crazy infatuation within all men in this world.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes widened, unable to defend his spirit against such an attack, he let out an even more agonizing cry.</p>
<p>“Teeheehee” giggled the women whose flawless figure was now half unclothed. The sultry sound of her giggle was the most deadly nightmare invading Ling Chen’s spirit that was drowning under immense pain. Using her hands to hold up her buxom, as she began to slowing softly bend towards Ling Chen. Till she completely stopped in front of him, her enormous breast laid only inched away from his face. While flashing an exquisite smile, her hands suddenly began to slight pull away from each other.</p>
<p>Rip……</p>
<p>Once again the sound of fabric tearing followed the motion of her hands, and the light veil of fabric was fully split, as a pair of enormous breasts bounced out. The white of her buxom was completely exposed in front Ling Chen, her breasts were not just of remarkable size, they also displayed an impeccable round shape. Her breast were as white as snow, almost as if they were a pair of flawless moons hanging in the night sky, this perfect shape could not be rivaled. Along with her exposed body, her soft silk skin initiated pure lust, white still retaining a fragile jade like quality, seaming to break upon touch.</p>
<p>The strength of Ling Chen’s spirit was being drained as he was almost crushed by Lunar Scourge….The temptation in front him was such a beauty, a beauty that no man could ever hope to resist. But to him, it was more frightening than the world’s most horrifying demon, bewitching his spirit to crumble. He felt his spirit to be mercilessly hammered by two enormous pressures with one bang after another…..</p>
<p>“Little brother, do you think my body is pretty? Do you want to try to touch this big sister?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 42: Reversal(II)</p>
<p>Inhuman singing speed, wait for the drop at about 1:58. Funniest comment I found “My mom asked me why I’m kneeling in front of the computer.I showed her the video. She also kneeled on the floor.”</p>
<p>The seductress brought her lips close, whispering warm, soft words beside his ears like a lover would, as she whispered, her two creamy, soft hands each grabbed one of Ling Chen’s hands, and then carried his hands, slowly pressing towards her own chest… Yet, in the depths of her endlessly enchanting eyes, a flash of cold light appeared in her eyes. When she ripped apart the last layer of clothes, she already felt the momentary blankness of his mind. As long as she allows him to touch her skin, then, his mind will definitely… completely collapse!</p>
<p>“You~~~~” Two hands being seized by a pair of soft, white hands, gradually getting closer to that pair of massive breasts so perfect that they did not seem to belong to the human realm, Ling Chen virtually heard his own soul crumbling.</p>
<p>The seductress’s smile became more and more ambiguous, suddenly, the hands of the man in her grip broke free, grabbing towards her breasts on their own. While she was unprepared, a pair of giant breasts had already been gripped by Ling Chen’s hands, heavily rubbing them. Due to the excessive strength, her rich, firm breasts squeezed out to the sides of the spread out fingers. It was simply impossible to grasp the entire breast with one hand, his two hands enjoying the feeling in a wanton frenzy. No matter how his 10 fingers grabbed and rubbed, he was always able to grasp a full hand of soft, creamy breast. No matter how he held them he was always able feel the wonderful shape of the breasts that made people amazed.</p>
<p>The breasts of the seductress are extremely sensitive. Adding that her own body was also in a relatively weakened condition, through his frenzied actions, all of the strength in her body instantly left her. She bit her teeth resisting the feeling of numbness and slight pain from her breasts. The gaps of her lips actually unable to help but releasing slight sounds of whimpering and moaning. When she realised it, she abruptly covered her mouth, suppressing the moan that was about to leave her mouth.</p>
<p>Having a man touch my breasts… is actually this kind of feeling… it’s completely different, from when I touch them myself…</p>
<p>She did not take away Ling Chen’s hands, lightly biting her teeth and bearing it. The enchanting smile on her face remaining: “Heehee, little brother, are big sister’s breast pretty… Ah!”</p>
<p>Her voice stopped in a shout of surprise, she lifted her beautifully streaked, slender neck, her entire body trembling, a series of spasms travelling though her beautiful legs. The reason for this is because Ling Chen’s hands suddenly applied force, the strength of his originally rapidly rubbing hands suddenly increasing, mercilessly grabbing onto her breasts like two steel clamps, his clasped fingers also clamping those 2 pink gemstones at the tip in between his fingers.</p>
<p>“It hurts… lighter… it hurts… Ah!” The seductress’s body is too sensitive, the sharp pain and numbness that came at the same time made her release a sharp, trembling moan: Her flushed red dimples were especially like she had drank alcohol, her curved thick eyelashes shook violently, her legs grinded together like they were convulsing. Her two hands helplessly grabbed his wrists wanting to take away his hands, but her strength was too weak, she could not move his hands at all. Lifting her beautiful eyes, she was faced with a pair of terrifying eyes… Ling Chen’s eyes that had initially become blurred, are right now releasing a savage glow like that of a beast’s, the seductress immediately felt a series of chills in her heart.</p>
<p>He had not been captivated… not at all from the very beginning!</p>
<p>“Nggaahhhhh———”</p>
<p>Bam!!!!</p>
<p>This is a roar of pain that practically shattered the seductress’s ear drums. Under the loud roar, the black space began to crack, more and more light penetrated in without any delay. That pair of hands grabbing onto her breasts once again tightened a bit, the severe pain practically made her eyes flow with tears. She saw that on his left hand wrist, the black light of Lunar Scourge had already become as dim as the evening stars… From attempting to engulf this human’s mind until now, a couple minutes have already passed. This time, had already reached the limit of the current Lunar Scourge. In between, there was also the strong interference towards his mind that she caused using her own seductiveness, but it still did not succeed… And this human, until now he is still maintaining a clear mind!</p>
<p>What a terrifying person…</p>
<p>Is he really human? Or is he a god or a demon… or even an ancient being that surpasses gods and demons!</p>
<p>“Let me go… Lunar Scourge will immediately stop your pain, and will never again try to engulf your mind… Let me go…” The seductress could no longer see any hope. She endured the sharp pain from her chest, using her quivering, lovely voice to beg for mercy towards this human. If things continued like this, Lunar Scourge… will instead be controlled by this human!</p>
<p>“Ahhhh—-”</p>
<p>What answered her, was only Ling Chen’s loud roar.</p>
<p>Originally wanting to use her body to mesmerize him. Who knew that instead she was completely naked, and having her breasts tightly grabbed by him, using this incredibly humiliating position to beg for mercy towards him. Lunar Scourge that even gods and demons fear, has actually completely stumbled in the hands of a human. But right now, besides begging for mercy what else could she do? Lunar Scourge’s soul force has already reached its limit, it can no longer engulf his mind, she needs to beg for mercy to prevent that most terrifying consequence from appearing. How can she allow Lunar Scourge and herself, to fall under the control of a human.</p>
<p>“I beg you, let me go… I’m willing to fulfill all of your demands… I’m willing to help you become the world’s strongest human… I’m willing to become your slave… Let me go, do not continue!!”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhh!!!”</p>
<p>Regardless of how she pleaded, she was unable to see even a hint of change in Ling Chen’s ice cold eyes. Lunar Scourge’s light became increasingly dimmer while trembling, gradually reaching the edge of completely extinguishing.</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhhhh!!”</p>
<p>Rumble!!!!!</p>
<p>“Over… It’s over…” Following Ling Chen’s final all out roar, the black space completely crumbled, all of the darkness rapidly vanished as if being forcibly pulled away by some kind of massive aura. The seductress’s enchanting eyes became dim, all of her hard work, all of her begging did not have any effect. The result that she was afraid of seeing the most, has finally still arrived.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two beams of red light suddenly flashed across before her eyes. Her gaze immediately became wide awake, looking towards the source of those two rays of red light… What she saw are Ling Chen’s eyes. Right now, his eyes actually appeared a colour like blood!</p>
<p>“Ha… Hametetsusaigan!! You… You are…” (TL: Yeah about that, I couldn’t think of a good translation for this so I stuck it into a kanji to romaji converter and came up with this. 破灭杀瞳 is the original and I changed 瞳 to 眼. The general meaning is Killer Destruction Eyes… so yeah.)</p>
<p>Rumble!!!!</p>
<p>Another muffled sound, all of the darkness vanished entirely. Everything, once more returned to the way when Ling Chen first stepped into here. In the air, countless little orbs releasing a green white glow continued to float, illuminating this space in a green white glow. On the ground there remained traces of where Ling Chen had rolled. Besides that, there is no other difference, as if nothing had ever happened.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s hands finally released from the seductress’s chest, his eyes slowly shut together, and then like a wooden log he fell backwards. heavily falling onto the ground, completely unconscious. On his left hand, there is a black ring tightly wrapped around it, on the ring there is no longer any sort of light.</p>
<p>The seductress took a few steps backward, taking big, heavy breaths. Her two massive breasts shaking up and down due to her heavy panting, waves appearing on her breasts that made the blood of people boil. On top, there are also interchanging blue and red finger prints. She lifted her hand, with a shake of her fingers, a body of black clothing exactly like the one before had already covered her body that is enough to mesmerize the entire world. She then silently looked at Ling Chen who is on the ground, her expression incredibly complex.</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge is already wrapped around his wrist, unable to break away. Lunar Scourge cannot leave on its own, Ling Chen himself also cannot take it off. Because once it has been conquered, it will forcibly accompany the person controlling it until the day that person dies.</p>
<p>“Is this human… a monster? How can a human, possess such a powerful spirit… How can Hametsusaigan, appear on a human!” Rubbing her sore breasts, the seductress spoke to herself while panting.</p>
<p>“In legends, only gods or demons whose spirits have reached an extremely high degree can through their eyes, use their spirit to destroy all life. Their eyes at that time, are the terrifying ‘Hametsusaigan’. But Hametsusaigan has also only appeared in that far away age of gods and demons, after then it has never appeared… 10 000 years ago the gods and demons had already fallen and scattered about, right now they’ve especially fallen to a horrendous state. Hametsusaigan should not appear even more. But this human’s eyes at that time…”</p>
<p>“Could it be, it was just an illusion, or that wasn’t even Hametsusaigan?”</p>
<p>But no matter what, Lunar Scourge was unable to turn him into its own puppet, instead it was subdued by his powerful, peerless spirit, becoming his possession. From today onwards, Lunar Scourge can only support him, subjecting itself to his control and commands, unable to resist.</p>
<p>The feeling of pain at her chest finally began to subside. The seductress walked over to Ling Chen, staring at his face and body, after a long time, she slowly said under her breath: “There’s already no other choice. Hope that he can bring me a surprise…”</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>“Brother, why are you always unwilling to tell me about your past? I really want to know. Everything about brother, I want to know.”</p>
<p>“Because, I used to be bad guy.”</p>
<p>“Bad guy? What kind of bad guy?”</p>
<p>“Very, very bad, the worst kind.”</p>
<p>“Hee, I don’t believe you, brother is clearly the best person in the world.”</p>
<p>“… What if, I really am a bad guy that everybody hates? Will Ruo Ruo hate me?”</p>
<p>“Of course not! I will never hate brother. If… Ya! If brother really is a bad person, then, I will become a bad person like brother. This way, I can still stay beside brother, not needing to separate from brother. Even if brother does something very wrong and is punished, I will also receive the punishment with brother.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Ruo Ruo…</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes opened. Not even waiting for his vision to clear, he immediately sat upwards. After a brief period of haziness, everything that had happened to him before rapidly replayed in his mind.</p>
<p>“My little master, you’ve finally awoken.”</p>
<p>A lovely voice came from beside his ears, making Ling Chen’s already numb body a little more softer. Immediately, he scrunched his eyebrows, jumping up from the ground, coldly looking towards the seductress: “You!!”</p>
<p>When talking, he lifted up his left hand. On his wrist, a black coloured new moon is wrapped around it. 15 holes distributed with 3 vertical and 12 horizontal. Only now, it did not bring him any hint of pain, instead it quietly attached itself to his wrist. Ling Chen could faintly feel the control he had over it.</p>
<p>This terrifying item that wanted to engulf my mind before… It belongs to me now?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 43: Lunar Scourge(I)</p>
<p>Inhuman piano playing speed. Pray to the god! He is playing this song.</p>
<p>Facing Ling Chen’s ice cold face, the seductresses pink, flower petal like lips gently flattened. Such a light movement, and yet it brought out a such a deep sense of grievance that made people unable to help but to feel pity for her: “… I’ve already called you little master but you’re still so fierce towards me. If little master is still not willing to forgive my words of offence from before, then at worst, I’ll let you lightly hit my butt a couple times.”</p>
<p>Her voice was bewitchingly soft, yet her tone was also like that of a young girl acting in a pettishly charming manner. Finishing speaking, she even twisted her waist, slightly perking up her butt that was like a full moon in an arc that made people’s blood boil.</p>
<p>This kind of voice, expression, position… Even the mind of a heartless person would be in chaos. Ling Chen’s gaze uncontrollably fell upon her perky butt, stopping there for a good amount of time before difficulty pulling away, and then not daring to look at her again, secretly cursing in his heart “Witch”.</p>
<p>This is definitely a woman that men would be unable to let go of even if they clearly knew that their lives would be shortened.</p>
<p>The slight expression of distress on Ling Chen’s face made the corners of the witch’s lips slightly curve. She twisted her body, taking elegant steps walking before Ling Chen, saying in a lovely voice: “Little master, why have you stopped speaking? If you’re not going to say anything, then I’ll take it as you’ve already forgiven me!”</p>
<p>Being closer, Ling Chen could practically smell the sweet fragrant air from her sweet lips. For a moment, a hot feeling started to spread from the bottom of his body, travelling across his entire body in the blink of an eye. Ling Chen lightly bit his teeth, using an incredible willpower to completely suppress the fervent feeling. He used a cold tone saying: “Who exactly are you… Why are you calling me master!”</p>
<p>“Because you have conquered me, now I can only obediently obey you, making you my little master.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>A slight prickling feeling still remained in his head along with a deep sense of exhaustion. Everything that had happened before once again quickly flashed by in his mind. If not for Shui Ruo that he has alway been worrying about supporting him, there were many times where his mind almost collapsed from the ravaging of Lunar Scourge and the seduction of the witch. But in the end, under the strength of his endlessly terrifying spirit, he won. In contrast, that force intending to engulf his mind has instead been defeated by his indomitable spirit. In the end, the origin of that soul force… which is also what the witch called “Lunar Scourge” was instead invaded by his mind, making it unable but to fall into his control and command.</p>
<p>This kind of feeling of being able to freely control it cannot be fake. Ling Chen extended his right hand, holding onto the black crescent moon on his left wrist… This is “Lunar Scourge” that the witch spoke of? Exactly what kind of thing is is, why is it called this name? This witch suddenly started calling me “Little Master” could it be because…</p>
<p>“Tell me first, who are you! Why are you calling me master.”Ling Chen continued to ask with his head lowered. Right now he was a bit afraid to lift up his head and look at the witch, but from her body he also did not sense any hostility and danger.</p>
<p>“It’s very simple. Because you conquered Lunar Scourge, and I am an existence that is attached to Lunar Scourge. Conquering it, is also conquering me. Right now you are its master, naturally you are also my master.” The voice that came out from between the witch’s slightly pursed lips still made Ling Chen have a feeling like his soul was gradually growing numb. He knew that this witch was not purposely acting bewitching, it was simply an inherent quality of hers. Because a purposely exhibited state of seductiveness would not be able to enchant people’s hearts to such a degree. Ling Chen had to adjust his breathing multiple times before making that strange feeling in his body slowly go away. Just her voice was enough to make a person like him with such a strong will develop the desire to rip apart all of her clothes. If it was a normal person… there is practically nobody that is able to retain their reasoning under her voice.</p>
<p>“You are its item spirit?” Ling Chen said. Items that have reached a certain level of strength have a possibility of deriving an item spirit. Item spirits are a kind of spiritual existence. To be more straightforward it is the consciousness developed by the item. And once this consciousness matures, it will derive an incorporeal body, in other words an illusory image. Once the incorporeal body reaches a certain maturity, or encounters some kind of opportunity, it will evolve into a corporeal body… This witch said that she is an existence that is attached to Lunar Scourge, could it be that she is an item spirit from the legends? In addition it’s also an item spirit that has attained a physical body — Before fainting, he once grabbed onto her breasts, the warm, soft, silky feeling still remained in his head unable to be driven away, no matter what that feeling could not be fake.</p>
<p>“Item spirit? Hm… Little master can think of it like that. Little master can relax, from now on I will definitely obediently obey little master’s words. okay?” Ripples of tenderness appeared in the witch’s eyes, a voice like that of a flighty girl carrying a natural charm making all the cells of a person’s body a bit softer. Ling Chen inhaled a deep breath, saying with an ice cold expression: “Stop your act! The reason you are displaying such a lowly posture before me is because you are the loser… Wanting to engulf my mind but failing and instead falling under my control. If the one that had failed was me, my mind would have been completely destroyed and my body would fall entirely under your control, becoming a complete puppet! Even more I will not forget how painful the pain that I suffered was.!! If I did not turn around and take over Lunar Scourge turning it into my own possession… I would definitely use any method… to destroy it, and kill you!!”</p>
<p>Witch: “…”</p>
<p>The feeling before of having his mind destroyed and engulfed was unbelievably strong and realistic, it even brought up those memories that he did not want to remember. He was confident, if not for his struggling, his mind would really have been destroyed. While bearing that immense pain, all of his mind was struggling and resisting, he had already forgotten the existence of his body. Right now after becoming clear-headed, his mind was continuously confounded and wondering… This is clearly a virtual game world, why does there exist such realistic menticide! (TL: Menticide)</p>
<p>Ling Chen is by no means a good person. On the contrary, he is a person that doesn’t let anything go. What Lunar Scourge gave him, is the enmity of trying to capture his soul, this witch is an accomplice. With his personality this kind of grudge would definitely be repaid 100 fold. But, Lunar Scourge has instead been conquered by him, making him unable vent his hatred… This Lunar Scourge is definitely not an ordinary item. Being able to spawn an item spirit, maybe it’s grade is Mysterious God… even Saint Destroyer! Right now even if you begged him, he would definitely not destroy it.</p>
<p>As for this witch… this woman that is so enchanting that she can easily capture people’s souls. He admits, he really finds it a bit difficult, or maybe it would be more accurate to say unwilling to lay his hands on her… Not to mention, she is just the item spirit of Lunar Scourge.</p>
<p>The witch’s lips heavily pursed, like a young girl that had been majorly wronged and was about to cry: “Come on little master, I know I was wrong… If you’re still angry, then hit my butt hard, don’t be mean to me, okay… I will obediently listen to little master’s words. I will do whatever little master wants me to do, even if little master wants me to take off my clothes and sleep with little master, I will also…”</p>
<p>“You… What is your name!!” Ling Chen felt his blood freeze, forcibly interrupting her. He is afraid that if this witch continues speaking, his will power will eventually break.</p>
<p>“Then, is little master still mad at me?” The witch blinked her misty eyes, saying pitifully.</p>
<p>“Tell me your name and I won’t be angry.”</p>
<p>After finishing this line, Ling Chen himself was first startled for a moment. He discovered, towards this witch in front of him the anger and enmity that he was holding back in his heart had actually completely disappeared. The hate of taking one’s soul is even greater than taking one’s life. The pain that he had suffered before was still vivid in his mind, but towards this witch, right now he couldn’t even muster up a hint of enmity… instead, what he felt more towards her were the waves of desire that he was stubbornly suppressing.</p>
<p>This scary woman…</p>
<p>She is Lunar Scourge’s item spirit. If I’m always carrying this Lunar Scourge on me from now on, does that mean that I have to bring around this woman everyday… Thinking here, a slight chaos appeared in his heart. Spending a long period of time with this woman that has a terrifyingly strong allure towards men, he didn’t know if there would be a day where he would be unable to completely resist, unable to control himself…</p>
<p>Towards this terrifying woman, he discovered that really didn’t have any confidence.</p>
<p>My name is Qi Yue, the qi of poignant beauty, the yue of crescent moon. Don’t forget it little master.” Yelling out her own name, the witch’s pitiful expression of grievance also disappeared without a trace, being replaced by an overwhelmingly beautiful smile: “I’ve already spoken out my name, little master needs to keep to his word and not be mad at me anymore!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen let out a long breath, doing his best to not let his eyes meet with the witch’s. He lifted up his left hand saying: “Tell me, this ‘Lunar Scourge’, what is it?”</p>
<p>Qi Yue took two steps forward in an elegant stance, carrying an intoxicating fragrant air that shook Ling Chen’s sense of smell and his soul. Her enchanting eyes looking at her little master with a tenderness like soft silk, slightly opening her pink lips and releasing a misty, charming voice: “Right now little master is the master of “Lunar Scourge”. If little master wants to find out anything about it, it can be very easily done.”</p>
<p>Before, when Ling Chen scanned for its information what he got was a pile of “????”. Listening to Qi Yue’s words, Ling Chen felt enlightened, lifting up his left wrist to his eyes, scanning it again… Immediately, the information of this black crescent moon fully displayed in his mind.</p>
<p>[Lunar Scourge]: Type: Luna Chain, Grade: Unknown, Equipment Requirements: Exclusive to “Ling Tian”, cannot be unequipped, cannot be dropped, cannot be discarded, cannot be traded, cannot be stolen. An ancient item of evil. Forged by the highest ranking moon god of an ancient time by collecting the hatred, resentment, aura of death, aura of blood and remnant power from the gods, devils, humans, demons, beasts, and spirits that had died in the war of the gods and devils. Investing 1000 years of effort, gathering countless sins, sanguinary, hatred and cruelty in one, the fusion of endless negativity. The day it was completed the entire world darkened, dark clouds enveloped all of Forgotten continent. The highest moon god initially wanted to purify its power and then control it, but instead suffered its engulfment, his body and soul being destroyed, perishing at that moment. The forces constituting of Lunar Scourge resulted in it becoming the world’s most loathed, most ominous object, also becoming an item that the moon god clan will stop at nothing to destroy. Its existence was bearing the punishment of the heaven’s at every moment, until the day that the pillars of its strength all scattered, from then on no more news of it was ever heard of. Forgotten continent also after this long period of time, forgot about the legends related to it.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 44: Lunar Scourge(II)</p>
<p>Holy shit…</p>
<p>The information that came from Lunar Scourge made Ling Chen’s expression vigorously change. “Forged from the resentment, hatred, blood aura, death aura, and remnant power of gods, devils, humans, demons, beasts and spirits that died in the war of gods and devils, gathering countless sins, sanguinity, hatred and cruelty in one, the fusion of endless negativity”… This crescent moon shaped black ring, actually has such a big background. Such a terrifying origin, even involving the ancient times of Forgotten continent. It’s even forged by the highest moon god of the moon god clan that the chief mentioned, it is an object of great evil!</p>
<p>His heart beat quickened, for him its background and origin are not important, whether it is ominous or lucky is even less important. What he wants to know the most is obviously this Luna Chain that is forged by a god and possesses a shocking background and origin… Exactly how strong are its attributes. That’s right, this is a Luna Chain! Its grade is determined as “Unknown”, could it be that its grade is too high… too the point that the system is unable to distinguish it?</p>
<p>[Lunar Scourge]:… Equippable energy crystals/orbs: 15. The horizontal sockets can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. The 3 sockets in the middle can only equip exclusive saint orbs.</p>
<p>Socket 1: Empty. Can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. Exclusive God Orb: [Aries Orb]</p>
<p>Socket 2: Empty. Can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. Exclusive God Orb: [Taurus Orb]</p>
<p>Socket 3: Empty. Can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. Exclusive God Orb: [Gemini Orb]</p>
<p>Socket 4: Empty. Can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. Exclusive God Orb: [Cancer Orb]</p>
<p>Socket 5: Empty. Can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. Exclusive God Orb: [Leo Orb]</p>
<p>Socket 6: Empty. Can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. Exclusive God Orb: [Virgo Orb]</p>
<p>Socket 7: Empty. Can equip any energy crystal and energy orb of any grade. Exclusive God Orb: [Libra Orb]</p>

<p>Middle left socket: Empty. Can only equip [Star God Orb]</p>
<p>Middle right socket: Empty. Can only equip [Moon God Orb]</p>
<p>Middle left socket: Empty. Can only equip [Sun God Orb]</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>After the background information of Lunar Scourge are its stats as a Luna Chain. Not even finishing reading the stats, Ling Chen was already astonished to the point that he could not be more astonished. Astonished to the point that even his mind appeared a slight sense of dizziness, making him a unable to believe over and over again if what he saw was real.</p>
<p>That’s right, this is a Luna Chain… a Luna Chain forged by the highest moon god at that time.</p>
<p>And it… can simultaneously equip a whole 15 energy crystals or energy orbs! Of them 12 sockets can be equipped with crystals or orbs of any grade!</p>
<p>At the beginning when the Novice Village Village Chief introduced Luna Chains to him, he once had a face of longing while mentioning that the strongest Luna Chain that has appeared in the history of Forgotten continent could simultaneously equip 7 energy crystals or orbs. And that Luna Chain is already the strongest Luna Chain that people know of, it can be considered a myth like existence.</p>
<p>And this one in his hands, is one that can equip a whole 15 crystals/orbs!! It is over double that of the strongest Luna Chain that the Village Chief mentioned!!</p>
<p>With every extra socketable hole on a Luna Chain it means that it can further increase an extra attribute. Its effect is essentially the same as having an extra item equipped. Because of that, even with a difference of one socket the value of Luna Chains will still greatly differ. Just like how a 2 socket Luna Chain and a 3 socket Luna Chain are two completely different concepts, 3 socket Luna Chains and 4 socket Luna Chains are also incomparable. A 7 socket Luna Chain… In people’s hearts that is a mythical item that is unable to be hoped for and can only be looked up at. A 15 socket Luna Chain… If this kind of item appeared, it would be enough to shock the soul out of a grandmaster…This is a complete and thorough cheat item. You can imagine how scarily a person’s strength would jump if one were to fill up the 15 sockets.</p>
<p>At the same time, these 15 energy sockets also each have their own exclusive orb. The 12 horizontal socket have “God Orbs” — Which are 12 Mysterious God grade energy orbs. As for the middle three sockets, they are actually 3 “Saint Orbs” — Saint Destroyer orbs!</p>
<p>They are the “Pillars of Strength” mentioned in Lunar Scourge’s origin?</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s wrist slightly trembled. He had already confirmed that this Lunar Scourge was definitely not some ordinary item, but no matter what he would never have thought that the it would be so extraordinary to such an extent. A Luna Chain with 15 socketable holes… If he did not see its attributes with his own eye but was instead told by another person, he would definitely not have believed in the existence of such a game breaking item.</p>
<p>In his deep excitement, Ling Chen continued to look at its additional attributes…</p>
<p>Additional Attributes:</p>
<p>[Heaven’s Jealousy]: The amount of EXP required for you to level up is 200% of the normal state, the amount of SP required for your skills to upgrade is 200% of the normal state, after death your level will directly return to 0. Permanent effect, cannot be removed. offset or deactivated.</p>
<p>[Heaven’s Wrath]: The way of the shura, there is not return, determined to walk this path, heaven’s wrath you will suffer.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “……”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “Son of a! @#￥%…”</p>
<p>Ling Chen rapidly called out his status page, finding out that his experience bar which was initially at LV9 50%, has now become LV9 25%! The corners of his lips twitched, he then hurriedly opened his skill page and looked towards the “Soul Sacrifice” skill… SP to Upgrade to LV3: 10000.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: (⊙o⊙)！！！！ (TL: I shit you not.)</p>
<p>Suddenly glimpsing that there were additional attributes, Ling Chen’s mood became increasingly excited… Because when the village chief was introducing Luna Chain’s he never mentioned at all that there existed Luna Chains with additional stats. But when he saw clearly those two additional attributes it was like having a bucket of cold water poured on him, completely dowsing his expectations, even a large part of the massive excitement from before had been drowned out. The explanation for “Heaven’s Wrath” he doesn’t understand, but that “Heaven’s Jealousy” is definitely the cruelest debuff effect that Ling Chen has ever seen in his life.</p>
<p>The experience required to level up is 200% of the regular amount, this means that at the same level the difficulty for him to level up is double that of the rest of the players! If this was still tolerable, then that amount of SP required to upgrade skills also becoming 200%… This made Ling Chen almost unable to maintain his calmness and start swearing out loud. This made his skill upgrading speed only half of the rest of the players. Looking at that “10000” SP required for Soul Sacrifice to upgrade from LV2 to LV3, Ling Chen even had the thought of dying. Only gaining 1000 SP by going through all kinds of hardships and exterminating a Faerie BOSS… These 10000 points, he didn’t know how many years and months he would have to work for!? Not to mention it’s not just this one skill, the SP required for all of his skills to upgrade is also double the regular amount!</p>
<p>His leveling speed is half of the rest of the players, his skill upgrading speed is half of the rest of the players… As a Luna Chain its attributes are extremely terrifying. But as long as he has it equipped his growth speed will be dragged down extremely seriously. Even though he can equip at most 15 energy crystals or orbs. But at the current initial stage, all he can find are some energy crystals of the lowest grade and only one energy orb… the Heartless Orb that he got from the Greedy Giant Toad. Besides that, he understands very clearly that wanting to gain an energy orb, or even a higher grade energy crystal is extremely difficult. As for the the exclusive God Orbs and Saint Orbs for Lunar Scourge… who the hell knows where they are, or even if they still exist. As an item that the god clan is determined to destroy, maybe its exclusive God Orbs and Saint Orbs have already been destroyed.</p>
<p>As a result, at least for the moment, the negative impact that Lunar Scourge brings to him is far greater than the positive influence. There simply isn’t a single player that can bear this kind of unbelievably ruthless negative impact.</p>
<p>Ling Chen immediately attempted to to take off Lunar Scourge… Without any luck, a system notification followed up beside his ears “Ding… Lunar Scourge is a forced equipment, cannot be unequipped.”</p>
<p>In Lunar Scourge’s attributes, it is clearly labelled “Cannot be unequipped” these three words. This is the first time that Ling Chen has heard of and seen a piece of equipment with such an attribute.</p>
<p>“How do I take it off!” Ling Chen lifts his head, staring at the witch and asking. If he can unequip it, then before gaining enough high grade energy crystals or orbs to offset its negative impact, he will definitely not equip this major drag of an item.</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s fine eyebrow curved, smiling and saying: “Once Lunar Scourge has been conquered, it will forcibly attach itself, because right now it is an existence that depends on you. If it leaves you, it will “die”. So, unless you can find all of its exclusive orbs, there isn’t any way to take it off. But, why does little master want to take it off? Could it be that you dislike it, or do you think that I’m not beautiful enough?”</p>
<p>“… There’s really no way to take it off?” Ling Chen didn’t give up continuing to ask.</p>
<p>Qi Yue pursed her lips, giving a sweet smile: “I just said, as long as you can find its 15 exclusive orbs, letting it possess a complete spirit and return to its full strength, little master will be able to take it off at any time. At that time, I will also be able to break away from Lunar Scourge and exist independently.</p>
<p>“… Then, the effect of this ‘Heaven’s Jealousy’, is there a way to deactivate it! Even though he understands in his heart that the hope of receiving a positive response is next to nothing, Ling Chen still asked unresigned. Truly the most loathed, most unlucky item, this negative effect is practically crippling.</p>
<p>“Of course not.” Qi Yue curved her lips responding, the corners of her lips carrying a faint smile. Of course she knows what Ling Chen is upset about. Probably anyone would have this kind of reaction if they unexpectedly saw the negative impact brought by Lunar Scourge. Although…</p>
<p>This response made Ling Chen let out a small sigh, but also feel helpless. He stayed silent for a decent amount of time… Does this mean that from now on I will have to bear this negative influence at all times in the Mystic Moon world!? Levelling speed is 1 fold slower that the rest of the players, skill upgrading difficulty is double of the rest of the players. A strong feeling of dejectedness built up in his heart, but was then quickly resolved. Lunar Scourge cannot be unequipped, the effect of “Heaven’s Jealousy” cannot be deactivated, then, he can only bear it.</p>
<p>I should trust, that even if my one step can only cross out not even half the distance of other players, I will definitely not be worse than anyone! On the contrary, I still have to be superior to everybody else! Even though there is this ruthless negative effect, but Lunar Scourge’s strength is undoubtable. Even though its negative impact is far greater than the positive at the beginning, but at the later stages, it will definitely be able to display its godly power.</p>

<p>Beetle wrecks scorpion. Lesson from these videos, don’t mess with beetles. They might kamen rider kabuto your ass.</p>
<p>His expression and mood quickly soothened, Ling Chen is always able to recover and adjust his mentality quickly under different situations. He stared at Lunar Scourge for a while, lifting up his head and asking: “This “Heaven’s Wrath”, what does it mean?”</p>
<p>“Heaven’s Wrath” is heaven’s punishment, “Heaven’s Jealousy” is the envy of heaven. From the meaning of the words, Heaven’s Wrath is clearly scarier than Heaven’s Jealousy. “The way of the shura, there is no return, determined to walk this path, heaven’s wrath you will suffer”, after “Heaven’s Wrath” is only a sentence that confuses people’s minds, making people completely unaware of its meaning. But Ling Chen is almost certain that this “Heaven’s Wrath” should be a negative effect even scarier than “Heaven’s Jealousy”. But what this negative effect is he also cannot interpret or clarify.</p>
<p>“This, I don’t know either.” Qi Yu gently shakes her head saying. Just this simple action brought up a roaring wave in the front of her chest, making Ling Chen’s eyes continuously jump, uncontrollably staring fiercely at her shaking breasts. He then silently bit his teeth and rapidly retracted his gaze, not daring again to look at her.</p>
<p>“How do you not know! You’re its item spirit!” Towards this answer, Ling Chen clearly didn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“But, I really don’t know. Actually, I can’t really be considered the item spirit of Lunar Scourge, I’m just a spirit that’s been sealed in here. I don’t know a lot of things about Lunar Scourge.” Qi Yue replied with a soft voice, that voice making Ling Chen’s entire body lose its strength.</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge cannot be taken off, do I really have to spend everyday with her from now on… Thinking here, a layer of cold sweat actually appeared on Ling Chen’s forehead. Being able to regularly spend time with such a woman is undoubtedly any regular man’s dream. But Ling Chen deeply understands the terrifying power of this woman’s natural seductiveness. He is unable to not worry that he will be unable to control this woman, and will instead one day be controlled by his woman.</p>
<p>“Not the item spirit? A spirit that has been sealed here? What does that mean?” Ling Chen furrowed his brows asking.</p>
<p>“This, is my secret, I cannot tell you.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Qi Yue suddenly gave a soft smile, red lips delicately opening, a soft voice carrying a fragrant air rising up beside Ling Chen’s ears: “Little master, do you feel that Lunar Scourge’s negative elements are a big nuisance? Lunar Scourge possesses the most terrifying strength, Lunar Scourge under a complete state will greatly surpass your imagination. Its existence, makes even the heaven’s afraid, and the person that can conquer Lunar Scourge, will suffer the envy of the heavens. So, regardless of who wears Lunar Scourge, the rules of this world will forcibly restrict his rate of growth. But, how can the might of Lunar Scourge be offset but such a little bit of negative influence… Little master, do you know, as long as you can find any of Lunar Scourge’s exclusive God Orbs or Saint Orbs… Just one, you will immediately know that its negative elements really don’t mean anything at all.</p>
<p>“Exclusive God Orbs and Saint Orbs… You and Lunar Scourge should have been here for a lot of years, right? Lets not talk about first whether or not they’ve already been destroyed by the god clan. Even if they still exist, that level of items has either been obtained by powerful beings or are located at incredibly dangerous locations that even the strongest beings are unable to reach. I don’t even know where they are, even if I did, what qualifications do I have to obtain them.” Ling Chen said sternly. The effect of a Faerie grade orb is already so amazing, how powerful Mysterious God grade and Saint Destroyer grade orbs are is easy to imagine. If he is able to obtain one, it would definitely be enough for him run wild among players. But, orbs of this grade, regardless of whether they exist or not right now… If they exist, how could they be so easy to obtain. Don’t say Mysterious God and Saint Destroyer, even Heaven End grade items are things that even in late game are impossible for players to obtain.</p>
<p>What Ling Chen said is very reasonable. Yet, Qi Yue continued to have a slight smile like before, leisurely saying:”Little master, I will of course help you find them. The Moon God clan will indeed want to destroy them at any cost, but as long as Lunar Scourge is not destroyed, its exclusive God Orbs and Saint Orbs will also never be destroyed. At the same time, the 12 God Orbs and 3 Saint Orbs can only release their power when socketed onto Lunar Scourge. Others no matter if they are humans, gods or devils, if they obtain one, not only will they be unable to use any of its power, it could even bring upon them misfortune, they would think that every second they have it is a second too long.</p>
<p>Qi Yue pursed her lips smiling, and then slowly said another line: “Little master, I understand the annoyance and worry that you have in your heart. But, all of your worries will all completely disappear… Because, right in this underground space, there exists an exclusive God Orb!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was dazed for a moment, and then quickly asked: “Where!?”</p>
<p>There is an exclusive God Orb here? It’s a God Orb… a Mysterious God grade energy orb!! The level of value of a Mysterious God grade energy orb is even comparable to a piece of Mysterious God grade equipment!! If he is really able to obtain such an item right now… that’s a Mysterious God grade item! Then, even if it’s the negative effects of “Heaven’s Jealousy” he can completely accept them.</p>
<p>The eagerness in Ling Chen’s expression made the witch smile even more bewitchingly: “It, is right with that big guy that is protecting this place before here. Although that big guy has already slept for too many years, he’s already lost his sense of alertness, allowing little master to walk over here so easily.”</p>
<p>The big guy guarding this place before here… Tao Tie!?</p>
<p>“The nature of the big guy is greedy and short tempered, making him guard this place for so many years has really been too hard on him. Who knew that he actually really endured for so many years, not leaving even until now. Lunar Scourge’s Gemini Orb is on his body, right now you have Lunar Scourge, he will not hurt you. In addition he will unconditionally give the Gemini Orb to you on his own. If he’s in a good mood he might even give you some other gifts. Little master, do you want to go find that big guy right now?”</p>
<p>“Lets go!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen did not hesitate, directly walking towards the passageway back to the sixth area. He really wants to offset the negative effects brought by Lunar Scourge. He especially wants to know… how powerful of an ability does a legendary Mysterious God orb possess.</p>
<p>Qi Yue gave a slight smile, following behind him and maintaining a distance of 2 to 3 steps. Even though Ling Chen is walking in front, he can still smell the hazy fragrance coming from Qi Yue’s body. He admits, this atmosphere made him intoxicated. This woman behind him, once you get caught in her charms, virtually any man would be unable to escape. While walking the images of him heavily rubbing her breasts before constantly appeared in his mind. He secretly shook his head many times, but the more he wants to put aside these images the more he cannot do so. Moreover that unbelievably soft and silky feeling flooded his mind unable to be forgotten… Even the impulse of turning around and grabbing towards her breasts appeared in his mind many times, to enjoy that ultimate feeling.</p>
<p>A spirit as strong as his, being able to maintain his composure even while facing Shui Ruo’s naked body so many time, this is the first time that he has the feeling of being unable to control himself towards a woman.</p>
<p>Witch, witch, witch!!</p>
<p>“Little master, are you thinking about whether or not you want to touch my breasts.” Behind him Qi Yue’s soft voice traveled over.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s feet staggered, and then his footsteps quickened, not even turning his head and walking forward. Behind him, a series of charming, bewitching laughter rose up.</p>
<p>This time Ling Chen did not purposely hide his aura. The instant that he walked out of the passage, an endlessly massive sense of danger came from the front, making him abruptly stop his footsteps. Tao Tie’s massive body once again appeared in his vision. Right at the instant that he stepped into here, Tao Tie woke up from its deep slumber, being accompanied by a series of deep, earth shattering roars…</p>
<p>Huu~~~~~~~</p>
<p>The deep voice made Ling Chen’s ear drums and entire body feel very uncomfortable. Tao Tie’s body stood up, when it stood up its body reached a height of more than 50 meters. In front of its colossal body Ling Chen felt as insignificant as an ant. Only now did he discover that its eyes are actually not on its head, but under its armpits. Under each armpit a black and green eye bigger than Ling Chen’s body opened, a terrifying gaze locking onto his body… Or to be more precise, locking onto Lunar Scourge on his wrist.</p>
<p>“Who~are~you!”</p>
<p>The aura of danger suddenly weakened by a lot, the awoken Tao Tie did not launch an attack, instead facing Ling Chen and releasing a thunderous voice like a human’s.</p>
<p>Tao Tie’s voice was like it came from space, its vibration made all of the blood in Ling Chen’s body boil. The pressure from a Mysterious God beast cannot be looked down upon, even Ling Chen feels like he is suffocating when facing this massive beast. He believes that if this Tao Tie forcibly locks onto him with its aura, he won’t even be able to move, don’t mention fight it. Mysterious God beasts are creatures that players can absolutely not defeat… This is not nonsense, but common knowledge.</p>
<p>Ling Chen breathed in a deep breath. Right when he is about to answer, Qi Yue who was behind him walked beside him, opening her mouth first and saying: “Hey big guy, not seeing you for so many years, I didn’t think that you would still be guarding here. I’m actually a little moved you know.”</p>
<p>“I may be greedy, brutal and called a beast of extreme evil by the world, but I am never ungrateful, I especially don’t go back on every word that I’ve said… 10000 years, for me it is just a short flash. Only I didn’t think that just 10000 years have passed and another person that has gained Lunar Scourge’s attachment has already appeared. Little girl, looks like your destiny may be a bit better than expected. Exactly what the future will be like, everything still needs to depend on your own hard work. My promise is to protect Lunar Scourge before it can find a new host, but that does not include protecting and helping you.”</p>
<p>Tao Tie stood there not moving. When the sound of his voice travelled over, Ling Chen did not see its massive mouth move at all, he doesn’t know where the voice comes from.</p>
<p>“‘Another’ person that Lunar Scourge has attached to…” Is it that 10000 years ago, Lunar Scourge was attached to a person? Don’t know if that person was like me and conquered Lunar Scourge, or if that person became Lunar Scourge’s puppet.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 46: Gemini Pearl(II)</p>
<p>Beetle wrestling. I’ve come to love these bug fights.</p>
<p>Qi Yue pursed her lips and smiled: “The words that you say are still so annoying you big guy. Although, him and that guy from last time are different you know. Last time, is because he was strong enough, having the qualifications to become Lunar Scourge’s puppet. But this time… Lunar Scourge initially wanted to destroy his mind so that he didn’t spread word of any of the stuff here. Because with his strength he does not have the qualifications to become Lunar Scourge’s puppet. But he was not destroyed, right now he’s even become my little master.”</p>
<p>Tao Tie: “…”</p>
<p>A long silence… Ling Chen felt a gaze that made his entire body tense looking attentively at his body.</p>
<p>“To think that this kind of thing would happen, Lunar Scourge, was actually conquered by a human. No doubt it is related to the fact that all of Lunar Scourge’s pillars of power have been dispersed, but this human is also definitely not an ordinary human. Being able to pass through here under my awareness is already enough to highlight his extraordinariness.” Tao Tie’s voice rose up, his tone no long calm.</p>
<p>“Yo, big guy, that’s a very dishonorable excuse. Little master being able to enter inside is entirely because you were sleeping like a log, that’s it.” Qi Yue’s fine eyebrows slightly raised, saying insultingly.</p>
<p>“…” Tao Tie’s massive face revealed a slight sense of embarrassment. He very rationally chose to not argue with Qi Yue about this topic, instead facing towards Ling Chen: “Human, do you know how shocking of an accomplishment you have achieved. Completely conquering Lunar Scourge, this is an unprecedented event, even the strongest Moon God at the time was unable to do so.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“I said before that this has a big relation with Lunar Scourge’s power being scattered. Under a complete state destroying your mind would be an insignificant task for Lunar Scourge. But no matter what, you are the first person to conquer Lunar Scourge. You are also the first master of Lunar Scourge, and that little girl. You are also the person that is about to make Lunar Scourge resurface in the world after a 10000 years of silence. Obtaining Lunar Scourge you will gradually gain the world’s strongest power. But, you will also receive the most difficult mission… You, need to in a short period of time, before the Moon God clan discovers the reappearance of Lunar Scourge, collect all 12 God Orbs and all 3 Saint Orbs. After that, you will possess the power to confront the entire Moon God clan. Because once they discover the reappearance of Lunar Scourge, they will definitely do whatever it takes to destroy you and Lunar Scourge. If you do not have enough strength to oppose them, you will be unable to protect Lunar Scourge and especially yourself.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen suddenly lifts his head, the muscles on his face twitching.</p>
<p>If Lunar Scourge is discovered, I will suffer the full power of the Moon God clan…</p>
<p>The fuck…</p>
<p>Being hunted down by the Moon God clan… Ahhhhhh!</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge’s negative impact isn’t just “Heaven’s Jealousy” and “Heaven’s Wrath”, it will even lead to being hunted by gods!!</p>
<p>Any random oracle from the Moon God clan is already the god of a continent. Being hunted by the entire Moon God clan, is there something even scarier than this!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen immediately felt that Lunar Scourge on his left wrist was like a hedgehog. But right now even though he is its master, he is completely unable to take it off.</p>
<p>“Human, are you afraid?” While Ling Chen was tangled in his thoughts, Tao Tie’s heavy, deep voice suddenly sounded beside his ears.</p>
<p>“Afraid?” Ling Chen shakes his head and then lifts his head, staring straight at Tao Tie’s massive pupil: “No, I am nervous. Nervous towards the uncertain feeling that Lunar Scourge has brought to my potential fate. You need to know, nervous and afraid are two completely different thing. There is only one thing in this world that can make me feel afraid, but it is definitely not death and destruction!”</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo’s Isrock, was once the only thing that he was afraid of… Ling Shui Ruo’s safety, right now is still the only source that can make him feel afraid. Death and destruction? He can no longer remember exactly how many times he has danced around the edge of death. That kind of thing, how can it make him afraid.</p>
<p>“Hehehehe, human, I like your answer. That’s right, from your eyes I truly cannot see ‘fear’ this kind of thing. Even though I have not seen the world for 10000 years, but of all the humans that I have seen there is not a single one that has eyes as deep and dark as yours. Looks like, you are a human with a story. Being able to conquer Lunar Scourge has also determined that you will not be ordinary. Even without Lunar Scourge, in the future on Forgotten continent you would still be able to spread your name throughout the entire world. This is the first time that I have developed interest towards a human’s past, but I will not ask you. You who have obtained Lunar Scourge, regardless of your past, your future has been determined. Have you really thought about it?”</p>
<p>“A future that has been determined? What do you mean?” Ling Chen suddenly frowns.</p>
<p>After a short silence, Tao Tie’s gaze fell upon Qi Yue’s body, and then returns back to Ling Chen: “Looks like the little girl did not tell you. No matter, what I care about is only the survival of Lunar Scourge, what does your fate have to do with me. Another bloodthirsty demon appearing on Forgotten continent also has nothing to do with me. Human, even in the eyes of the lowest of the gods amongst the Moon God clan your strength is unbearably small. They can exterminate you into nothingness in the time it takes to snap their fingers. Go look for the God Orbs and Saint Orbs, the little girl will direct you. Only by collecting all of Lunar Scourge’s exclusive orbs will you have the strength to confront the entire Moon God clan… and I mean the entire Moon God clan.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>The determined fate that he talked about… exactly what is it? Is it the fate of being destined to go against the entire Moon God clan?</p>
<p>“Then, take this!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was about to ask when a white light suddenly flashed past his eyes. A white pearl slowly floated down from up high, falling towards his position.</p>
<p>This… is this one of Lunar Scourge’s exclusive orbs that Qi Yue said is in Tao Tie’s hands?</p>
<p>Mysterious God orb… Thinking of these 3 words, Ling Chen’s heart immediately started o jump uncontrollably, “babump babump”. He looked at this white pearl falling down, and then stretched out his hand, carefully holding it in his hands.</p>
<p>The pearl is about as big as his palm. Ling Chen is just right able to hold it single handedly. In the entirely silver, semitransparent sphere, a “♊” is fuzzily displayed.</p>
<p>That is the the symbol for the gemini constellation of the 12 zodiac constellations!</p>
<p>“This is the exclusive orb for Lunar Scourge’s third socket… the Gemini Orb. Right now I hand it over to you. It, can increase your strength by 1 time… no, by even more. Believe me, it will stimulate your desire to look for the other orbs. During that time when all the orbs were disperse, I went through great pains and found it, but also only it. The rest of the orbs, from now on will have to depend on the combined efforts of you and the little girl. Work hard, human.”</p>
<p>Tao Tie’s voice shook Ling Chen’s ear drums. Ling Chen did not respond, instead looking towards the attributes Tao Tie spoke about at the first moment… A Mysterious God orb, exactly how strong of a power does it possess?</p>
<p>[Gemini Orb] Type: Energy Orb, Grade: Mysterious God, Attributes: None: Can only be socketed on Lunar Scourge.</p>
<p>Effect: Can simultaneously equip two weapons, and the effects of the two weapons stack (The two weapons include one-handed and two-handed weapons. When simultaneously equipping two weapons, two-handed weapons can be held singlehandedly, stats and control will not be affected, and the two weapons will not affect or interfere with each other.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>Staring at the Gemini Orb’s stats, Ling Chen looked at it for a whole 30 seconds.</p>
<p>These are the stats of a Mysterious God orb!? Before this he thought that the orb would inevitably be very powerful and so he already had enough mental preparation. But seeing this Gemini Orb’s stats with his own eyes, he still stared at it stunned for a long time. These stats aren’t just amazing, they’re practically insane!! Way stronger than what he thought it would be!</p>
<p>Simultaneously equipping two weapons, this kind of situation is not uncommon. A lot of virtual game world all have classes that can equip dual weapons, like dual sabers, dual sword, dual daggers… But, being able to equip 2 two-handed weapons at the same time is completely unheard of. The reason two-handed weapons are called two-handed weapons is because under the restrictions of the virtual game world’s rules the support and use of two hand is required to use them. They’re overall stats are also inevitably a lot more superior to single handed weapons of the same type… Being able to equip 2 two-handed weapons, moreover the usage of the two weapons do not interfere with each other. This means that 2 attacks can be launched at one time with the dual weapons, casting two of the same or different skill, completely the same as one person displaying the attack ability of 2 people… This is practically a godlike attribute!</p>
<p>Even scarier is that the stats of the simultaneously equipped weapons stack! This means that regardless if it’s the weapon equipped in the right hand or the left hand, when attacking they can both exert the combined stats, effect and even skills of the two weapons!!</p>
<p>This is practically…</p>
<p>This kind of effect made Ling Chen virtually unable to find any descriptive words to describe its powerfulness. Not only can can two attacks be launched at once, each attack also greatly surpasses the attack strength of a single handed weapon, the increase in ability is more than 1 fold! For instance, after he reaches LV10 he can equip Soaring Cloud in his left hand and Sand Blade in his right. Then he can use both hands together to cast Full Power Strike or Crescent Slash that have no cooldown time. At the same time, what he’ll be hold in his two hands will be two weapons that are the same as having the combined stats of Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud… A Gold and a Faerie, their stats after stacking will be one that surpasses Faerie!</p>
<p>And this, is all gifted by this little orb!</p>
<p>Gemini Orb… Gemini… Allowing one person, to be the equivalent of two people, two even stronger people!</p>
<p>Looking at the Gemini Orb’s stats over and over again, Ling Chen’s mood could not calm down for a long time.No wonder Qi Yue said that I would be about to be willing to accept Lunar Scourge’s negative effects, and no wonder Tao Tie said the the Gemini Orb would stimulate his desire to find the rest of the orbs. The ability of Lunar Scourge’s exclusive orbs are actually powerful to such a degree!</p>
<p>Ling Chen took a deep breath and then lifted his left hand, using the method of socketing normal energy crystals and bringing the Gemini Orb near Lunar Scourge’s third socket. The moment they made contact a silver stream of light flashed by, the Gemini Orb had already quickly shrunk. With the system notification of “Socketing Successful”, Lunar Scourge’s third hole released a silver glow.</p>
<p>“Ding… Gemini Orb successfully socketed, you can now simultaneously equip two weapons of any type, and the stats of the dual weapons will stack, when using them they will not affect or interfere with each other.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Lunar Scourge’s exclusive lunar skill unlocked.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was dazed… Socketing an exclusive orb will also be accompanied the unlocking of an exclusive skill!? This Luna Chain not only can be socketed with 15 orbs, it also has it own exclusive skills!?</p>
<p>He did impatiently look towards the newly unlocked lunar skill. Instead he called out Mind Saber and then Wolf Fang Blade… One two-handed sword, one one-handed sword, just like that were being casually held in both his hands at the same time. On his stat page, regardless if it was attack strength or each of the basic attributes, what was displayed was the combined values of the two swords!!</p>
<p>Author’s note:</p>
<p>[PS: I am a Libra, and so it has been determined that the Libra Orb will be the coolest, most amazing orb, do you guys have a problem with that, huh? Um… if you have any suggestions for the orb of your zodiac, you are welcome to leave a comment.]</p>
<p>So yeah, I think it would be cool if you guys also left a comment about what you would want the ability of your zodiac orb to be and what you think the effects of the zodiac orbs and saint orbs in the book will be.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“How is it little master, is the Gemini Orb’s ability to your satisfaction?” Soft ripples flowed out of her eyes like water as she said smilingly towards Ling Chen. She was very pleased with the change in his facial expression the moment he saw the Gemini Orb’s stats.</p>
<p>Ling Chen nods his head: “Truly very strong, it can even be said to be a bit overly powerful.”</p>
<p>“This is just the ability of one orb. Currently you are at the lowest ring of Forgotten Continent’s ability ladder. But even if it’s the current you, if you are able to find 5 of the above exclusive orbs it would be enough for you to become a force to be reckoned with. If you are able to find any of the Saint Orbs then your power would be enough to overlook the entire world. If you are able to collect all of the God Orbs and Saint Orbs, then even if the entire Moon God clan moves out against you they would be unable to do anything to you. At that time little master will be truly invincible. Little master, right now are you very eager to obtain the rest of the orbs?” Qi Yue said with a slight smile, in her smile there is a hint of unspeakable mysteriousness.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>He did not answer Qi Yue. Ling Chen is not an idiot, from Qi Yue’s slightly peculiar expression along with what Tao Tie said before, he vaguely detected something that made him faintly puzzled and uneasy. But what these things are he had no way of finding and clarifying them. If he can collect all of the Saint Orbs and God Orbs he will become invincible, even the Moon God clan would be nothing in his eyes. This kind of future and achievement is certainly what any being yearns for… But, this kind of thing occurring in a virtual game world is a little too absurd. Would this kind of situation really be allowed to appear in the Mystic Moon game settings? In the same respect, Lunar Scourge and things like the Gemini Orb are without a doubt equipment and orbs that completely break the balance of the game. Their existence is already slightly unusual.</p>
<p>Also, that deeply hidden unusualness is Tao Tie’s voice and eye expression, exactly what is it?</p>
<p>He lifted his left hand and looked at Lunar Scourge that now has the Gemini Orb, checking out the newly unlocked skill.</p>
<p>[Moon Shadow]: Lunar Scourge’s exclusive lunar skill, when cast it will release silver moonlight illuminating the target’s shadow, forcibly freezing all shadows under the moonlight, suppressing all movement of the shadow and its owner. Effect: All targets in a X meter radius will be forcibly stunned (X = Current Level) for 5 seconds. MP Consumption: 0. Cooldown Time: 60 secs.</p>
<p>Using the reflection of the moonlight, and then through fixating the shadow suppressing all of the target’s movements. This is actually an extremely peculiar stun skill! The stun time lasts for 5 seconds, it’s also an AoE stun skill that’s area increases with level! At the same time, this kind of method that achieves the goal of stunning through freezing the target’s shadow is absolute, it does not add an abnormal status. And so this kind of stun condition can even work on super bosses that are completely immune to all abnormal statuses!</p>
<p>A forced stun for 5 seconds, what is the meaning of this? Against players of the same power level, 5 seconds is enough to defeat the opponent while they are completely defenseless. Against opponents stronger than himself, 5 seconds is enough to reverse the situation. Against opponents that cannot be competed with, 5 seconds can give himself an abundant amount of time to run away. Moon Shadow’s effect is definitely not as simple as stunning, Ling Chen very clearly understands how powerful this skill actually is.</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge not only can equip 15 energy orbs, it even adds such a powerful skill, and from the looks of it there appears to be more than one. This kind of cheat item, no wonder it would bring about “Heaven’s Jealousy” and “Heaven’s Wrath”!</p>
<p>“Very good! Making the Gemini Orb return to Lunar Scourge has always been my greatest desire for these 10000 years. Because the arrival of this moment means that Lunar Scourge is about resurface in the world. Human, even though you surely possess a spirit that can considered terrifying, but your power, your strength is truly too weak. Even with the Gemini Orb you cannot defeat even the weakest martial artists on Forgotten continent. What you need to do is hide the Lunar Scourge on your body, and then increase your strength and find the rest of the God Orbs and Saint Orbs… And among this, there is also an even more important affair. That is to not allow the Moon God clan to discover any traces of the appearance of Lunar Scourge, or else you will definitely be destroyed and Lunar Scourge will once again suffer disaster. You must remember my words. A portion of Lunar Scourge’s strength originates from the strength and soul of my ancestor, I will not allow it to be destroyed, absolutely not!”</p>
<p>Tao Tie’s deep voice made Ling Chen lift his head. He thought for a bit and then slightly nodded his head.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, does this count as god level hidden quest?</p>
<p>Why is this kind of feeling not like a game world that seeks “balance” but instead like being in a movie with a strange setting.</p>
<p>How come after entering the Mystic Moon world, a lot of things that I’ve encountered are so different from the virtual game worlds that I know of.</p>
<p>Qi Yue glanced at Ling Chen, taking in the confusion in his eyes. In the depths of her eyes, a strange colour flashed across for a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>“The path towards collecting the other God Orbs and Saint Orbs will definitely be very difficult. It could take 100 years, 1000 years, or even a more distant time. But in possessing Lunar Scourge you need to fulfill this duty that must be carried. Because with every day that passes, there is an increased danger of being discovered by the Moon God clan. If when you are discovered you have still yet to find all of the God Orbs and Saint Orbs, then, your fate will only be death. I believe that you who possess such a gaze and is able to conquer Lunar Scourge, will not willingly be killed by any person. And all of this, I am unable to help you with. If I follow you after walking out of here, it will only increase the chances of Lunar Scourge being discovered. Not only that, after you leave here I will stay here for at least another 100 years. The Moon God clan knows my feelings towards Lunar Scourge. If I leave they will definitely find out and then find Lunar Scourge’s location through me.”</p>
<p>“Hee, big guy, before I thought that your appearance was a little scary, but now I suddenly feel that you’re actually pretty cute.” Qi Yue lifted her lips smiling.</p>
<p>Tao Tie’s deep voice came from all directions: “Every person has their own beliefs and persistence, beasts are the same. The reason I am willing to do such for Lunar Scourge, little girl, the most important reason, even you do not know.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Qi Yue blinked her eyes, her face revealing puzzlement.</p>
<p>Tao Tie did not speak with her again, his mind focused on Ling Chen. Under his two armpits two massive eyes simultaneously flickered an instant of black-green light. At the same time, Ling Chen’s body also flickered for an instant a same black-green glow. Ling Chen looked at his own body puzzled, but did not have any strange feelings for changes.</p>
<p>“Human, on your body I have imprinted a very faint spiritual mark. This spiritual mark will not be discovered by the gods of the Moon God clan. Its effect is to allow me to sense when you encounter a hopeless situation in which there is absolutely no hope. Under that kind of unavoidable circumstance, I will appear. This is the last thing that I can do to help you. Of course, I hope that this kind of circumstance never appears. And before this, I have something that requires your aid.”</p>
<p>“My help?” Ling Chen paused, with his current ability what could he do to help this powerful Mysterious God beast.</p>
<p>Under his gaze, Tao Tie’s mouth gradually opened. The instant that massive mouth opened a creepy feeling crawled up in his heart. What a terrifying mouth that is. Even though when opened it is only the size of a house, the feeling that it gives him is one where it can easily swallow an entire mountain. Two neat rows of teeth even sharper than knives made from steel reflected a cold light that made people’s hearts shiver.</p>
<p>Huu…</p>
<p>In a gust of sharp air a dark grey item flew out from his mouth, heading straight towards Ling Chen. After it was about to land on the ground, its speed abruptly lowered and then gently floated downwards as if being held in a bubble, landing in front of Ling Chen.</p>
<p>This is a grey, oval shaped item, about the size of a football/soccer ball. At first glance it actually seems like… an egg.</p>
<p>Opening such a big mouth and just spewing out this little thing… Aren’t you embarrassed!</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s amorous eyes slightly narrowed, watching this grey sphere: “Hey big guy, what is this? Could it be your…”</p>
<p>“No, it is not my descendant. This was entrusted to me after that miserable war by a great beast before it died. It seems to be its child, but also seems like it’s not. Because even though it has its aura, its descendants’ unhatched status is not like this. Before handing it over to me, it told me to not ask about its origin, especially not allowing me to tell anyone who it came from. It’s last wish is that it can successfully hatch and then peacefully live the rest of its life, not bearing any more responsibilities and duties. Time has already passed an unknown number of years and it has finally reached the edge of hatching.” Tao Tie slowly explained.</p>
<p>“You mean?”</p>
<p>“Very simple, even though the great beast that entrusted it to me wished that it could live a peaceful life, its origin and ability have determined that its life cannot be peaceful. This is an unchangeable fate. If I continue to keep it, that will only slowly wear away its talent. Take it with you, and then find a non-elemental energy orb and give it to it. It only needs that last bit of power and it will be able to successfully hatch. Even though I do not know what his hatched status will be like, but after being born even if it’s at the infant stage, it will still provide you with strong assistance. This assistance is not powerful attack ability. Where its strength lies, you will naturally know once it hatches… Maybe, it will surpass my expectations.</p>
<p>Ling Chen now completely understood that what this Tao Tie handed over to him is shockingly an egg that can give birth to a powerful beast… From a player’s perspective, this is a — Pet egg!!</p>
<p>Although, the premise is that it can hatch. And the last condition for it to hatch is that it requires a non-elemental energy orb. An energy orb, not a crystal! With respect to players, especially at the early stage, this condition is truly harsh to the max. Right now Ling Chen does have a non-elemental orb — the Gemini Orb, but even if he had a problem with his brain he would not use it to hatch the unknown pet egg.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>[Mysterious Egg]: An egg that is about to give birth to an unknown life form, its origin is unknown.</p>
<p>Ling Chen put away this egg. Being able to be called a “Great Beast” by Tao Tie, without even needing to think the origin of this egg must be extraordinary. The beast that it will hatch out will also definitely not be a regular beast. Looks like he needs to go use all kinds of methods to gain a non-elemental orb. But he understands in his heart that energy orbs this kind of thing will basically not appear at the early stage of the game. Because only super bosses of at least Faerie grade will drop energy orbs, and the drop rate is very low, a lot lower than even high grade equipment. The only energy orb that he obtained on his own, “Heartless Orb”, is from a low level Faerie beast, the process in the middle was unbelievably dangerous. And being able to drop an energy orb has to be ascribed to him soloing it while under-leveled. It is not all players that have his luck and ability to encounter and kill a Faerie beast. At the early stage of the game, Faerie beasts are simply undefeatable by players. Energy orbs are also valuable items that only very few players can obtain in the mid-late stages.</p>
<p>Wanting to obtain a non-elemental energy orb is really hard for the average people.</p>
<p>“I will hatch it out as soon as possible.” Ling Chen said. After some slight contemplation he lifts his head and asks: “Tao Tie, can I ask you a few questions?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen has too many questions that he wants to ask Tao Tie, but Tao Tie bluntly refused his request. He said with a heavy voice: “Do not ask me any questions, you who does not know anything is lucky. If you know too many unnecessary things, then your body, your mood, and your mind will all bear some heavy shackles. So, some things, it’s better if you don’t know too early. If you really want to know, then find and discover them yourself in the process of looking for the God Orbs and Saint Orbs. I know what you want to know, but even if I know the answer I will not tell you.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“Yo!” Qi Yue pursed her lips in discontent, saying with a beautiful smile: “You big guy, you’re really not cute. Entrusting such an important thing to my little master, and yet not even allowing him to ask a few simple questions. How hurt will this make my little master feel. Shouldn’t you compensate my little master with a little something?”</p>
<p>Just a simple demeanor and yet it is so exceedingly coquettish, a casual voice and yet so extremely sweet, making Ling Chen beside her feel for an instant that all the strength had left his body. Tao Tie was silent for a short while before opening his mouth and saying: “Okay, I Tao Tie never wish to be indebted to others, not to mention right now your ability is too weak, raising up a bit your ability isn’t a bad option either. Then, you have accepted my entrustment, you can propose one of your conditions, but this condition cannot include asking me some questions that you want to know the answer to, and is only limited to increasing your ability. I can increase your level or stats, and can also give you an amazing piece of equipment, I can also bestow upon you powerful skills. You, choose yourself.”</p>
<p>Giving away a pet egg of extraordinary origin for free, and even giving a bonus of being able to propose a condition…</p>
<p>Is this a big pile of pies falling from the sky!? (TL: Glossary)</p>
<p>Virtually without even thinking about it, Ling Chen responded: “Skills!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, very good, I admire your answer. Level and stats can be brought up on your own, high grade equipment can be obtained on your own. Only skills… That is what will always accompany you and will give you a lifetime of benefits. Then, do you need passive or active skills?”</p>
<p>“Passive.” Ling Chen still responded without any hesitation.</p>
<p>“Very good.”</p>
<p>After the sound of his voice ended, within Tao Tie’s two eyes two dots of black light suddenly flickered. After lasting for a couple seconds the light suddenly shot outwards heading straight for Ling Chen, ramming into his body.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body slightly tilted backwards, his body already being enveloped by a mass of black light, and then gradually seeping into his body. Once the light completely sunk into his body, a system notification rose up beside his ears.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have gained unique skills [Heaven Wind Technique], [Item Manipulation Technique].”</p>
<p>[Heaven Wind Technique]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV10. Sp to Upgrade to LV2: 400. Ancient battle technique, after practice it can greatly increase the ability to control any weapon. Effect: When using any weapon, damage dealt is increased by 5%. Effect does not stack with other weapon proficiency skills.</p>
<p>[Item Manipulation Technique]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV10. Sp to Upgrade to LV2: 400. Ancient battle technique, after practice equipment that surpasses your current level can be equipped. Effect: Ignores any piece of equipment’s level requirement by 1 level.</p>
<p>Such powerful skills!! Ling Chen almost yelled out in shock.</p>
<p>After all apprentice professions switch to their official professions, they will all have proficiency passive skills for their respective weapons, like “Sword Proficiency”, “Spear Proficiency”, etc. These passive skills will increase the attack ability and hit rate when using the respective weapon. When gaining the Gemini Orb Ling Chen even once thought with a spear and a sword and maybe other weapons, doesn’t that mean that when he changes profession that he’ll need to learn 2, or maybe even more weapon proficiency skills! That would unquestionably waste a large amount of SP. But this [Heaven Wind Technique] gifted by Tao Tie is able to directly increase the damage dealt for all weapons. Furthermore it already increases 5% higher at just LV1. Heaven Wind Technique’s max level is LV10, wonder how strong the effect will be when it reaches max level. But this skill is not without flaw… It does not increase hit rate and cannot stack with other weapon proficiency skills.</p>
<p>[Item Manipulation Technique] is a passive skill special to the point that nobody is able to be not surprised. With this skill Ling Chen is able to equip LV10 equipment right now. Regardless if it’s Soaring Cloud or Sand Blade he can equip them all! This skill’s highest level is LV10. At LV1 it can ignore the equipment level requirement by 1 level. Then, if this skill gets maxed, it can ignore at least 10 levels! At that time, he will be able to directly equip equipment of which the level requirement is 10 levels higher than his own! This effect is practically outrageous.</p>
<p>Of course, the pretense is that their levels reach a high level. And reaching a high level, requires a large amount of SP. Upgrading to LV2 require 400 (A/N: Lunar Scourge has something to say: The initial amount is 200!) SP each, upgrading to max level, without even needing to think you know that it is an astronomical number. The stronger the skill, the more difficult is is to upgrade.</p>
<p>“How is it, are you satisfied with these 2 skills?” Tao Tie’s voice sounded beside his ears.</p>
<p>“Very satisfied!” Ling Chen nods his head saying. Honestly speaking, regardless if it’s number or quality the skills that Tao Tie gave him all surpassed his expectations. These truly are skills gifted by a Mysterious God beast.</p>
<p>“Even though they cannot immediately provide you with strong assistance right now, their effects will always accompany you, allowing you to benefit from them for the rest of your life. Especially Heaven Wind Technique, it originates from a person that even the Heavens and Earth once feared. Maybe one day, you will attain, or even surpass his level. Then, remember everything that I’ve said, collect all of Lunar Scourge’s exclusive God Orbs and Saint Orbs within the shortest amount of time. At the same time do not forget to hatch the life that I’ve entrusted to you… You especially need to remember, do not let the Moon God clan discover that Lunar Scourge has resurfaced!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen nods his head, looking up and glancing at the surrounding stone wall… Ever since falling into this place, everything that he’s encountered has honestly been like a dream.</p>
<p>“Everything that I should’ve said I’ve already told you. What I can give you has also already been given. This underground space is very empty, besides what you’ve seen there is already nothing else. Right now, I will send you to the upper world. I know where you come from, and that you should be a human that comes from a different world. I believe that before too long you will leave this land and head towards Forgotten continent, and there, is the true beginning. Good luck, human that has conquered Lunar Scourge.”</p>
<p>While Tao Tie was speaking, a mass of black-green light had already enveloped Ling Chen’s body. That is the light of activating spatial transport.</p>
<p>“So eager to send us away? You’re still so heartless you big guy.” Qi Yue said laughingly.</p>
<p>“Because I’m like you, I wish more than anyone else that Lunar Scourge can resurface earlier. Little girl, for you, all these years of waiting have not been a waste. No one knows what the future holds, but at least a turning point has appeared. Take good hold of it. The fate of him and Lunar Scourge, will determine your fate. Do not forget your real identity, especially… don’t let the Succubus clan discover you too early. (TL: 夜魔族, not quite sure what this is yet. Term might change in the future when I figure out what they are.)</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s eyes narrowed, smiling faintly: “Big guy, I don’t need you to worry about my affairs. Then, I guess we’re leaving. If there’s a chance in the future, maybe we’ll come to visit you.”</p>
<p>“It is easy to leave this land, but almost impossible to come in. This point you should understand better than anyone else. You have intelligence that surpasses any life form, and an appearance that can enchant the entire world. Maybe I really don’t need to worry about you. Go you guys, I hope that in my lifetime I will be able to once more witness Lunar Scourge overlooking the entire world!”</p>
<p>At this moment the green-black coloured light reached an extreme intensity, and then completely vanished with a flicker, Ling Chen’s body also disappeared from here. Following his and Lunar Scourge’s departure, Qi Yue’s body also gradually dimmed, until she completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Spatial transfer, when the green light faded, the scenery in front of Ling Chen instantly lit-up. Staying in the dark underground space for so long, the abundant light and fresh air here made Ling Chen shut his eyes in comfort, and then quietly let out a sigh of relief. Falling down Wolf’s Cliff, not dying under the effect of the sapphire necklace, afterwards desperately fighting the Greedy Avarice Toad, winning after countless shaves with death, and gaining big booty. And then encountering Tao Tie, encountering Lunar Scourge and conquering it. And so, he gained an item suffering from heaven’s punishment that makes even gods afraid, he gained an energy orb with a very powerful ability, he gained a pet egg of extraordinary origin, and he gained two powerful passive skills.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything felt so unreal, like a dream.</p>
<p>Are these really scenes that should be appearing in a virtual game world?</p>
<p>The End… for today.</p>

<p>This place belongs to the southern edge of the Novice Village suburbs. Wild grass covers the ground and there are no signs of any humans or beasts. Evidently Tao Tie purposely transported them to this quiet place. Ling Chen spread out the Novice Village map, after determining his position he glanced at the time, saying in a low voice: “Qi Yue, come out.”</p>
<p>On his left wrist after Lunar Scourge flickered a black light, the figure of an exceedingly voluptuous woman clothed in a black dress appeared before him. Qi Yue smiled sweetly, swaying her delicate body while taking slow, gentle steps and walking towards him, carrying with her a breeze of fragrant air the gently blew past his face. Once more seeing her body and looks, Ling Chen still uncontrollably fell into a trance for a moment. Under the sunlight Qi Yue was even more exceedingly beautiful, her long, jet black hair freely draped behind her, reflecting a gorgeous sheen under the warm light. The reflecting light intertwined with the pitch-black dress on her body, making her snow white skin glow even more. At a single glance at her perfect jade-like body, not knowing whether it was on purpose or just a mistake, the top button her black robe was undone. Her unfastened collar exposed white snowy skin that lit upon any eye.</p>
<p>“Young master, I didn’t know you missed me so much. We just got out, and you already immediately called for me. You’re going to make my heart throb.” She smiled sweetly at Ling Chen’s brief state of trance, while her glistening almond shaped eyes carried a warm light. She leaped into his arms, displaying all her bewitching allure.</p>
<p>Ling Chen used the uttermost willpower he could gather to force his eyes off her. He had already strengthened his mind before he called Qi Yue out, but still no matter how many precautions he took, he could not win against her. Taking a long deep breath, he had to admit this woman’s seductive allure is the most deadly weapon against all men in this world. Even the oldest of men would have their lust rekindle like a burning flame in front of her. So how could he, a young man in his prime, ever hope to resist her charm.</p>
<p>“Tell me, what was the destiny that Tao Tie said was already planned for me?” he said with a stern voice as he tilted his head toward her. Tao Tie’s words had clearly planted seeds of doubt within himself, and all this time he was trying to figure out what those word really meant.</p>
<p>“Your destiny, that’s to become the enemy of the Moon God Clan of course . Don’t tell me that young master is afraid?” Qi Yue giggled as her almond eyes began to narrow.</p>
<p>Ling Chen lifted his eyebrows and shook his head: “What I want to hear is the truth, my instinct tells me that his words were definitely not that simple!”</p>
<p>“Simple!?” Qi Yue said as she open her petal-like lips, shock flashing across her sultry face: “The Moon God Clan is the this world’s strongest clan, even this very world was named after the Moon God Clan. They are the ones that are in control of everything in this world, to be their enemy means the same as to be against the heavens. How could that be called ‘simple’. If so, then what does the young master consider to be not ‘simple’?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen:”……”</p>
<p>Ling Chen had no word to reply. Even the chief of the Novice Village had told him before that the Moon God Clan was the strongest clan in the world of Shen Yue. Every plot of land within the world of Shen Yun was under the control of the Moon God Clan. And every human knew that even the lowest of the Moon God Clan was still high above them, sacred and involiable. To be the enemy of the Moon God Clan was equivalent of challenging the Mystic Moon world’s strongest force. There is nothing in the world that more difficult, more foolish, and more unimaginable than to challenge them. This was absolutely not a ‘simple’ destiny.</p>
<p>But why do I feel uncertain about this, why do I worry that it not this straightforward. There is still more about Lunar Scourge that they did not tell me….</p>
<p>“Alright, I will believe you for now….then, can you tell me your background. You say that you are not really a simple item spirit and that there are special reasons to why you have been sealed within the Lunar Scourge. Then, can you tell me your real identity. I do not want keep someone who I know nothing about around me.” Ling stated with a harsh look in his eyes.</p>
<p>Tao Tie said that Lunar Scourge waited in that underground space for ten thousand years, and this woman has always been with it….Then that means this woman had been alive for at least ten thousand years.</p>
<p>“I have already told you before that this is my secret.”</p>
<p>“Since you call me master, then you should follow my orders!” Ling Chen said as he wrinkled his forehead. He knew that underneath this woman’s beautiful appearance was something very dangerous. He very clearly remembers that one message Tao Tie told Qi Yue: “You hold a mind that surpasses all and beauty that bewitches this whole world….”</p>
<p>“Teeheehee…..” Qi Yue laughed as she covered her mouth after hearing Ling Chen’s words. She laughed like many flowers blooming as her large, snow white buxom bounced along with her laughter causing her enticing allure to spread again. Her voluptuous body along with her thin, slender waist created sensuous curves. “Young master, you really are too cute, so adorable that I just want to hug you right now. teeheeheehee….”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “！a#￥%……”</p>
<p>Carrying a soft, sweet fragrance, Qi Yue enchantingly smiled while walking to his side. Strutting all the sensuous curves of her body, she pointed towards his chest with an unblemished, thin, jade-like finger. Then slowly moving up, she slided her thin finger under his chin and pushed his face towards her with a teasing smile: “Young master, you are right, You are my master, no matter what you choose to do with me, I will not resist. So let me take tender care of you. I will be sure to let you feel more than just comfortable. I will send you to heaven and hell…After all this is my duty, right?”</p>
<p>With his face turned, all that was in Ling Chen’s sight was Qi Yue’s irresistible beauty, her snow white skin and seductive looks was one that would be peerless for centuries. As she carefully lifted her buxom, a pair of full and round jade-white breast shocked him. Her’s were much greater than the average, however they did not droop at all, they perked up high almost rippng the seams of her clothes.</p>
<p>Ling Chen felt his heart pulsate uncontrollably and his body instantly blaze to the point in which all his blood seemed to begin boiling. This was the first time in his whole life that the flame of his lust has ignited to such a pinnacle. This lust was enough to burn away restraint in any man, and it was in such a uncontrollable moment that Ling Chen had the desire to push her onto the floor, tear away all her clothes, and unleash this lustful flame onto her….</p>
<p>Using one strong hand to push Qi Yue away, Ling Chen stepped back and turned around. “Return to Lunar Scourge at once!! Immediately!!” he shouted in a cold voice.</p>
<p>Surprise flickered in Qi Yue’s eyes, but still she smiled lightly and softly said: “Of course I will follow Little Master’s orders. Then I will first go back to rest, but be sure to call whenever you remember me” Qi Yue’s sensuous body and captivating voice started to slowly disappear, ‘till it was all gone. And Ling Chen just stood there for a very long time, until his heart finally calmed down and he could finally breath a long, deep breath.</p>
<p>To be seduced by such a woman, surely is something that all men in this world would dream of. He believed that there are no normal men that could resist against her allure. Even he had almost lost all sense…</p>
<p>Before he had met Shui Ruo, he had touched many women, to the point in which he had already lost count. Sometimes it was for the sake of making his assassinations easier, sometimes it was just to release anger. But after meeting Shui Ruo, he had not touched a single women…he did not want to do anything that would betray her. No matter how hard it was over the years, only he knew.</p>
<p>The afternoon was coming, and Ling Chen took out his backpack and grabbed all the level ten equipment he had gotten from the forgotten cave… Silver Helmet, White Silver bracers, Sand Blade. Ling Chen equipped all of these items on to himself. Evey if he was still level nine, he had the Item Control Technique which allowed him to successfully equip these items. Then he took out the Heartless Orb and easily attached it to the first hole on Lunar Scourge.</p>

<p>Ling Chen couldn’t help but to feel excitement as he looked at his current status. Now he had one Faerie item, one Gold item, and two silver grade equips. This set of equipment was what normal users could never hope to have. He had the ability to dual wield with two-handed weapons in both his right and left hand, and when he stacked his weapons he could achieve an attack value of 281! And if he added Fire of Rage, he could even break 300!</p>
<p>Such high attack strength was something that even warrior players with the highest physical attack might not be able to reach at LV20! Don’t mention players of other professions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The effect of stacking the stats of two weapons is definitely not so simple as just stacking the attack strength. All added attributes, ability values, added abnormal statuses, and even skills are all stacked. Attacking with one of the two weapons is able to exert the combined stats of the two weapons. Attacking at the same time with both weapons… it can practically be considered as having the effect of simultaneously attacking with four weapons. The powerfulness of the Gemini Orb makes people unable but to be speechless.</p>
<p>Not only has attack strength risen sharply, hit rate has also reached 37. He is confident that with his current level and hit rate, there should not exist a creature in the Novice Village that can make his attacks “MISS”. The scariest is his critical hit rate — 22%! This is the shocking value endowed by the Heartless Orb, it can make even assassins that have the highest average crit. rate feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Once again verifying his current position, Ling Chen withdrew his two very dazzling weapons and started heading in the direction of the Novice Village. He initially wanted to obtain some information from Qi Yue but the result is that he not only didn’t gain any information, he was even messed around with. He even didn’t have the time to ask how to find to exclusive orbs of Lunar Scourge along with how to hide Lunar Scourge. He started to be a bit afraid of this woman… What he is afraid of is not her, instead he is afraid that he will not be able to control himself under her seductiveness and do some kind of thing that would betray Shui Ruo.</p>
<p>Returning to the Novice Village Ling Chen headed straight for the item store.</p>
<p>“Hello Boss Wang, do you have masks here?” Ling Chen frankly asked as he walked into the item store. Towards Wang Jie Ling Chen was slightly grateful. If not for the sapphire necklace and those special potions that he gave, he could not have survived after falling down the cliff, and especially could not have defeated the Greedy Giant Toad, which would not have yielded in the later gains.</p>
<p>“Oh, it is you young hero. It seems that it’s already been a decent amount of days that I haven’t seen you.” After seeing him, the initially listless Wang Ji immediately became enthusiastic: “I do have masks, but they do not need to be bought. I know that a lot of you heroes from another world have to take into consideration your own privacy and don’t want to show people your real faces. So if there is a need you can directly receive a free mask from me… Here, for you.”</p>
<p>Finishing speaking, Wang Ji handed a mask made of iron over to Ling Chen. This kind of mask can be found all over the place in the Novice Village. The reality is exactly as Wang Ji says, in the game a lot of people like to wear masks, not wanting others to see their true appearance… Ling Chen is also one of these people.</p>
<p>Ling Chen wore the iron mask on his face, it just perfectly covered his entire face. Even though it is made of iron, it is very thin and light. There is no uncomfortable feeling or sense of weight while wearing it. He was just about to leave when he heard Wang Ji continuing to say: “Speaking of masks, it is not a type of official equipment, its only usage is to use it to cover your face. But a few years ago I heard from the village chief that there are still masks with attributes that exist on Forgotten continent. The existence of such masks are very rare, each one is a priceless artifact. At the very least in my lifetime I have not had the fortune of seeing that kind of legendary mask.”</p>
<p>Masks with attributes… If a person can obtain one, doesn’t that mean that they will have an extra piece of battle equipment over the rest of the players!</p>
<p>Walking out of the item store, Ling Chen headed straight for the northern area of the Novice Village. Right now what he needs the most is to rise up to LV10, and then leave the Novice Village and head towards the capital city of Forgotten continent. That is the true place for a new beginning. Currently he is LV9, jumping up to LV9 from LV5 under the massive amount of exp given by a Faerie boss. He is certain that his current level should be the highest one in the entire China warzone at the moment, even though right now his leveling difficulty is two times the rest of the players. But he believes that he will still be the first person to reach LV10.</p>
<p>At the most northern area of the Novice Village is the territory of the highest level creatures in the Novice Village — the LV10 brown bear.</p>
<p>An hour later Ling Chan had already reached the edge of the brown bear territory. As he expected, right now the figures of other players can still not be seen here. The average levels of players right now should be around 7-8, they will not come here yet.</p>
<p>Finding the location Ling Chen directly went offline. Of course he wouldn’t forget to take care of his Shui Ruo.</p>
<p>When he came online again it was already 2:00 pm.</p>
<p>“Lord… it’s a Lord BOSS! Quick! Immediately call everyone over!! Get as many people as possible, come as fast as they can!”</p>
<p>“Black Flame’s people? Humph! What do you guys mean! We clearly discovered it first, do you guys want to steal it?”</p>
<p>“He, you guys discovered it? Then why don’t you guys go exterminate it? Does this Lord have your names on its body!?”</p>
<p>“You!!!”</p>
<p>Just coming online the sound of arguing travelled into Ling Chen’s ears. After listening to a couple lines he already had a general idea of what was happening. He looked towards the source of the voices, two sets of player groups were right in the middle of confronting each other there. One side had around 30 players and was lead by an archer raising an iron bow. The other side only had a dozen or so players, the leader is a person raising an iron shield. Their location is at the edge of the brown bear territory, and within the brown bear territory…</p>
<p>There is huge brown bear lazily sleeping, its entire body surrounded by a mass of gold light.</p>
<p>[Gold War Bear]: Type: Beast: Level: LV10, Grade: Lord BOSS, HP: 8000…</p>
<p>LV10 Lord BOSS, Gold War Bear!!</p>
<p>Initially, the territory of the LV10 brown bears is not a place that the current players would enter. Presumably it is the group of that shield guard that haphazardly walked past here and just happened to discover that a Lord BOSS had spawned here. After that, the group of that archer also came here. The chances of spawning a Lord BOSS are very low, yet its allure is incredibly huge. No matter at which Novice Village, the appearance of a Lord BOSS will always cause a relatively big commotion. Because a Lord BOSS represents the highest grade equipment, and large amounts of EXP and SP for the novice stage. And so actually spotting a newly spawned Lord BOSS here made the heartbeats of the two groups quicken in excitement. But, how is a LV10 Lord BOSS something that they can deal with. What they all did is go and call more of their companions at the first moment.</p>
<p>The shield guard carrying an iron shield had an overcast face, staring at the archer and saying coldly: “Black Flame, we have always kept to ourselves and not interfered with each other. The BOSS belongs to whoever discovers it, this is a rule that everyone knows, are you guys provoking us the Battle Alliance!”</p>
<p>“The BOSS belongs to whoever discovers it first? Hehe, what a joke. A couple days ago, that Gold Battle Wolf was discovered by us Black Flame first, and amongst those people that came to steal it, do you dare to say that there were not people from your Battle Alliance there! Don’t think that we will be afraid of you guys just because you guys are friendly with the Yan Huang Alliance, us Black Flame have never been afraid of anybody!” The archer said with a dark face.</p>
<p>Ling Chen who was standing far away suddenly lifted his head, his two eyes fixing upon that talking archer, his gaze landing upon that name above his head…</p>
<p>Black Flame Bow!!</p>
<p>It is the leader of that group that forced him down the cliff that day at Wolf’s Cliff.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s gaze instantly became ice cold.</p>
<p>“He, what a big mouth. Even a little chief of the Black Flame Alliance is able to be so arrogant to such a degree, Black Flame really is becoming more and more better.”</p>
<p>A cold, indifferent voice travelled from far to close, people followed the source of the voice and looked over. A man with a mediocre face, a large body frame and equipped overly plainly slowly walked over here. His entire body did not have any point that was worth making people pause their gaze, only that pair of eyes, as sharp as an eagle soaring in the skies.</p>
<p>“Alliance Chief! You’re here!” Seeing him appear, the shield guard immediately became overjoyed, quickly going up to greet him.</p>
<p>Initially seeing this big man, Black Flame Bow’s face revealed a deep colour of puzzlement. He was certain that he seemed to have seen this man somewhere before. Hearing how the shield guard addressed him, his face suddenly turned: “You… you are… Xiao Qiufeng!!”</p>
<p>Number 7 on China’s virtual reality world Heaven Ranking, known as the “Judge of Life and Death” and the “Cold Magistrate” — Xiao Qiufeng! (TL: The Chinese is “一剑断生死” which mean determining life and death with one sword/one sword attack, I can’t think of anything else and it’s not important at all, but if anyone has a better suggestion then that’s cool too.)</p>
<p>The Heaven Ranking and the Earth Ranking, any player that has been in a virtual game world knows about the existence of these two rankings. What they record is the list of of the most apex players in the China virtual game world. The Heaven Ranking has 10 positions, players that are listed within are the 10 strongest people publicly recognised by all of China’s players. Listed within the Earth Ranking are the 20 strongest players excluding the Heaven Ranking. The Heaven Ranking and the Earth Ranking are the most authoritative, even the most sacred lists in the China virtual game world. The names of each person listed are able to shake all of China. Being able to be among the top 30 amongst the hundreds of millions of players in China, you can imagine just how strong they are. Each of them not only possesses powerful strength, they also have amazing charisma, and are the heavy targets of guilds to rope in. If a guild is able to have a Heaven Ranking or Earth Ranking master, even a small, unknown guild would become famous overnight. Even if it’s those forces that already have immense power, they would definitely become a leader among the group. Especially the Heaven Ranking, every person on the list is a mythical figure in the eyes of the rest of the players, they are god-like existences in the eyes of the players. If any of them appear, it would cause a great stir.</p>
<p>And this man that looks incredibly ordinary, he is one of the apex players listed in the Heaven Ranking. At the same time, he is the highest leader of the Battle Alliance.</p>
<p>The China region has a total of 100000 Novice Villages, there are a total of 10 people on the Heaven Ranking. The chances of meeting a Heaven Ranking master in a Novice Village could be said to not be smaller… Black Flame Bow could never have thought that in this Novice Village, he would actually meet the number 7 “Cold Magistrate” on the Heaven Ranking.</p>
<p>When he called out the name “Xiao Qiufeng”, his feet also took a step back in a shiver. They have 30 people on their side, while the other side adding Xiao Qiufeng only has 13 people. But “Xiao Qiufeng” this name holds too much shock and threat, this kind of difference in numbers is unable to bring him any sense of safety, in his heart there was only a trembling that could not be suppressed.</p>
<p>It’s not that he’s a coward… There is not a player that would be so stupid as to be enemies with those freaks on the Heaven Ranking.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Heaven Ranking ranked number 7, “Cold Magistrate” Xiao Qiufeng. Rumours says that no one has ever seen him smile before. Everything about him looks overly plain, no matter where he goes he will not attract the attention of people, but anyone that recognises him will back away when they see him. Because, one second he could be silent and indifferent, and the next he could be moving to kill. People that he wants to kill, regardless of who they are, he will not have any hesitation. The names “Judge of Life and Death” and “Cold Magistrate” are not just because of his cold heartlessness, but more because he only ever needs “1 Strike” to kill. The Battle Alliance that he leads is also very impressive in the China virtual game world, known by all. Rumours says that behind Xiao Qiufeng is an incredibly large underworld force. His birth father is the highest authority of the largest underworld force in the northern region of China, the “Battle Alliance”. A considerable portion of the virtual game world’s Battle Alliance’s members also belong to the Battle Alliance in the real world. The majority of people are ruthless outlaws that aren’t afraid of death. So even though the size of the Battle Alliance isn’t too big, there is nobody that dares to mess with them.</p>
<p>The fear that Black Flame Bow has towards Xiao Qiufeng is definitely not fake. Him, a small chief of the Black Flame Alliance, usually doesn’t even have the qualifications to meet masters of the Heaven Ranking. Who knew that in the Novice Village, when they had clashed with the Battle Alliance, that he would actually meet this Cold Magistrate that made people tremble with fear. Not only is it just him, when hearing Xiao Qiufeng’s name all of the Black Flame players behind him all revealed an expression of fear, there was no longer a single person willing to take a step forward.</p>
<p>“You guys have 3 seconds, disappear from my vision.” Xia Qiufeng’s gaze fell upon the body of that Gold War Bear that is in the middle of sleeping. He did not even glance at the people of Black Flame, his voice indifferent and cold, as if shooing a group of insignificant flies.</p>
<p>Anyone that has heard of Xiao Qiufeng’s name knew that if he is unable to drive away the people, then the next second, he will kill them.</p>
<p>Black Flame Bow is a chief of the Black Flame Alliance, he also leads a large group of Black Flame Alliance’s players. Usually he is also a very prestigious figure, but when has he ever been looked down upon by anybody before. Even though he is afraid of Xiao Qiufeng, he is also holding back a fire of rage in his heart. He took a glance at the people behind him and bit his teeth… He knew that challenging Xiao Qiufeng is a very irrational act, going against him, in the future, he knows that he will not have a good time in Mystic Moon. But if today he tucks his tail between his legs and runs away, he will bring shame to the entire Black Flame Alliance. If the news travels through the Black Flame Alliance, he will become a joke, alliance chief will also become furious.</p>
<p>He knows that he cannot displease Xiao Qiufeng, and at this time he also cannot retreat. A layer of cold sweat appeared over his forehead, the muscles on his face trembled for a good while before he set his heart and stepped forward saying, “The Cold Magistrate arriving himself, of course we have to give face. Our leader has said many times that if we meet the Cold Magistrate that we must treat you with respect… Okay, we will not meddle with this Lord BOSS today. We will just stand here and witness the Cold Magistrate’s might, seeing how an expert from the Heaven Ranking deals with this Lord BOSS!”</p>
<p>Xiao Qiufeng’s expression immediately darkened with the leading shield guard of the Battle Alliance also revealing a face of anger. Even though on the surface it looks like Black Flame Bow is backing down, and even making a concession of absolutely not interfering and stealing the Gold Battle Bear, it seems that at the same time he has also laid a trap. Xiao Qiufeng may be on the Heaven Ranking and is an established apex master, but Mystic Moon has only opened for a couple of days. All players are still at the novice stage. At this stage, the levels, stats and equipment of players simply cannot be pulled apart. Even the strongest players will not have too great of an advantage. These ultimate experts may have an extremely strong combat awareness and incredibly outstanding maneuverability and control, but even at the novice stage they are only able to easily solo one or multiple players, but against dozens of players, they will find it incredibly difficult to deal with them.</p>
<p>Gold War Bear is a LV10 Lord BOSS. A Lord BOSS of this level requires at least over a hundred LV7-8 players for there to be a chance of winning. Even if Xiao Qiufeng is here, the people of the Battle Alliance here definitely do not have the ability to kill the Gold War Bear.</p>
<p>Don’t even think about the Gold War Bear. Even with the 30 people of the Black Flame Alliance, them adding Xiao Qiufeng to the fight still do not have the ability to win against it.</p>
<p>Even though Black Flame Bow wants to retreat, he put out the attitude of watching a play. If the Battle Alliance, including Xiao Qiufeng go to battle against the Gold War Bear, there is a 100% chance of suicide. There will not be any fluke or suspense in this. If they don’t fight the Gold War Bear, that instead will shows their cowardness and dirty Xiao Qiufeng’s name.</p>
<p>“Black Flame Bow, looks like you feel that you’re living too comfortably.” The leading shield guard of the Battle Alliance said with a gloomy face.</p>
<p>“Hehe, what do you mean? We’ve already given a lot of ground in respect for the Cold Magistrate and given this Lord BOSS to you guys. Do you guys need to be so aggressive? Is it that being rude and unreasonable is the way of the Battle Alliance!?” Since he’s already opposing them, Black Flame Bow also pulled down his face and started to speak increasingly rudely: “The Gold War Bear is right there, we will stand right here and enjoy the mighty figures of you, the Battle Alliance, exterminating that Lord BOSS. Incidentally I can also help you guys record the battle to allow other players to enjoy it. You guys have a peerless master number 7 on the Heaven Ranking… Don’t tell me that the almighty Cold Magistrate is unable to deal with even a small LV10 Lord BOSS.”</p>
<p>“You!!”</p>
<p>A Lord BOSS usually needed around tens of players, even over a hundred of the same level working together to destroy it. Those apex players on the Heaven Ranking all possess the strength to solo Lord bosses 10 levels higher than their own. But the premise is that their level, stats, equipment, professions and skills all mature.They all understand that the Xiao Qiufeng right now is unable to beat this Lord BOSS. They also don’t believe that there is currently a player that can solo a LV10 Lord BOSS… If you have to say that such a person exists, then that person can only be the sole SSS rank expert in the world — Eve.</p>
<p>“Very good.” Xia Qiufeng’s expression was still indifferent. From his face you can never see any obvious emotional fluctuations. He turned his gaze, focusing on Black Flame Bow’s face and slowly said: “I will remember what happened today.”</p>
<p>Black Flame Bow’s body shook, a deep chill rose up in his heart. Behind him were the members of Black Flame, so he knew he could not lose face here. Even though he has taken a step back, in the end he still has offended Xiao Qiufeng.</p>
<p>Both sides suddenly entered a stalemate. Black Flame Alliance’s people did not retreat, but frightened by Xiao Qiufeng’s reputation they did not dare to continue saying anything. The players of the Battle Alliance all had a gloomy face, but they also understood that with the difference in numbers, if they fought they would not have any advantage. To fight for a BOSS or for territory, there are always countless big and small conflicts between different groups, but this time was different… Because who the Black Flame Alliance is facing today, is the leader of the Battle Alliance, the number 7 Cold Magistrate on the Heaven Ranking.</p>
<p>This seemingly small conflict, was bound to influence the entire Battle Alliance and Black Flame Alliance.</p>
<p>And this silence, was broken by an outsider.</p>
<p>Ling Chen!</p>
<p>He finished listening to that laughable verbal confrontation between the two groups like listening to a monkey show, and then quietly walked over. The two groups engaged in verbal battle for half a day but did not start to fight each other, and none of the two groups went up to kill the Gold War Bear… Because they simply didn’t have the ability to kill the Gold War Bear. Even if they fought to the death they would not even be able to touch a hair of the Gold War Bear… Because right now, that is his prey!</p>
<p>Before Ling Chen was standing behind a stone and did not release any sounds so the two groups of people did not discover him. Right now suddenly seeing an outsider approaching, they all looked towards him at the same time and then felt their heart’s sink… They are all guarding this place waiting for players from their alliance to arrive. If the information of the appearance of this Lord BOSS is seen by other players and spread out, then before too long this place will be packed with a countless amount of players. At that time it will be incredibly difficult for them to take this Lord BOSS for themselves. The scene created from the spreading of the information of a Lord BOSS on Wolf’s Cliff before was still fresh in their memories… The ownership of that Gold Battle Wolf was eventually taken away by the Yan Huang Alliance who had the greatest power.</p>
<p>“You there! This is the territory of the Black Flame Alliance, if you don’t want to become the enemy of the Black Flame Alliance then leave immediately!” Black Flame Bow turned around facing Ling Chen and bellowed coldly. The name of the Black Flame Alliance is enough to intimidate the majority of players. Not many players dare to displease this kind of large guild that is famous throughout all of China.</p>
<p>Standing at the edge of the brown bear territory Ling Chen didn’t even give him a glance, his gaze stopping on the Gold War Bear for a short moment before walking forward and then heading full speed towards the sleeping Gold War Bear.</p>
<p>This action of his made everybody stunned, and then almost all start to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>“What does he want to do… He isn’t thinking of wanting to solo that Gold War Bear, right?”</p>
<p>“Is this guy an idiot? Is it that his brain has fried from the excitement of seeing a Lord BOSS?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that this is a noob that has never seen a Lord BOSS before? Even if you want to die you don’t need to be in such a rush.”</p>
<p>Seeing him charge up to the Lord BOSS by himself, no one went up to stop him, instead they all revealed an expression of ridicule. With the strength of the current players, facing a Lord BOSS by yourself is the same as suicide. They could practically already see the image of this person being slapped to death after waking up this Gold War Bear.</p>
<p>But, the image that they expected did not appear. What they saw was a scene that made them dumbfounded, shocked and even tremble.</p>
<p>“Fire of Rage!”</p>
<p>While running, Soaring Cloud and Sand Blade were called out by him at the same time. Being buffed with Fire of Rage that had reached max level, Ling Chen’s basic attack strength immediately jumped to 331.</p>
<p>“Soul Sacrifice!”</p>
<p>A layer of dim red light appeared over his body. His HP dropped down to 1 in an instant, simultaneously an enormous power suddenly poured out from the depths of his soul. This is his first time using this berserk technique that puts himself at the edge of death. Against this LV10 Lord BOSS, he wants to deal with it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Ling Chen glanced at his current attack strength… 993!!</p>
<p>An attack value that almost reached 1000, an attack value that players at the current stage wouldn’t even dream of! This is currently the most peak condition that Ling Chen can attain, and is also his most dangerous state. Under this condition, his HP will at most maintain at 1, and cannot be recovered with any methods!</p>
<p>At the same time as being buffed with Soul Sacrifice, Ling Chen had already charged in front of the Gold War Bear, Soaring Cloud and Sand Blade simultaneously using “Full Power Strike” and cutting towards the large body covered in a golden glow . “Full Power Strike” does not have any cooldown time or usage restrictions, so both weapons are able to release it at the same time.</p>
<p>-1480, -1433!</p>
<p>One attack… No, it’s two attacks dealing damage at once directly shaving off over ⅓ of the Gold War Bear’s HP. The snoring Gold War Bear was suddenly roused from its sleep, abruptly jumping up from the ground and releasing a loud roar of anger. And at this moment Ling Chen’s second attack suddenly arrived, left hand Sand Blade using “Full Power Strike”, right hand Soaring Cloud using “Shooting Soaring Cloud”…</p>
<p>An arced yellow sword aura and a silver shooting star simultaneously crossed through the Gold War Bear’s massive body. Bringing up a red coloured damage and a yellow coloured critical damage so big that even Ling Chen himself was shocked.</p>
<p>-1436! -5922!</p>
<p>The Gold War Bear’s thunderous roars abruptly ceased. It maintained its action of roaring angrily and fell down powerlessly. This powerful Lord BOSS didn’t even get a clear view of who its enemy was before it died.</p>
<p>Two attacks… The entire process only took 2 seconds.</p>
<p>The surroundings area instantly became deathly quiet. Those players standing at the edge of the brown bear territory, originally waiting to watch a show all opened their mouths wide, widening their eyes… Pairs and pairs of eyes popping out so far that they’re practically about to burst out of their eye sockets.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Mixed up the chapter. Now is the the start of the noob stomping. Whoo! One more day untile Dragonball Chou!! And then another for it to be subbed!! And then I’ll watch it!!</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully killed LV10 Lord BOSS ‘Gold War Bear’, Fame+100, SP+100.”</p>
<p>Within the deathlike silence, a series of inhalation started to sound up. At the same time as the cold air filled their lungs, they could even hear the sound of their hearts trembling.</p>
<p>The defense of a LV10 Lord BOSS is extremely strong, even the person with the highest attack amongst them isn’t guaranteed to pierce through its defense. And this person… each of his attacks were actually all 4-digit numbers! They were certain that they did not see wrong, those were indeed 4-digit damage values. Moreover what each attack brought up were all 2 damage values… That last critical hit… actually hit for almost 6000 damage!!</p>
<p>2 seconds, this person dealt out over 10000 damage… In just 2 seconds, this LV10 Lord BOSS fell at his feet!</p>
<p>The scenery that appeared within these 2 seconds made them simply unable to believe in their own eyes.</p>
<p>This is a person wearing a silver mask, his face cannot be seen and his name is hidden. But they are certain that this person is a player and not an NPC. Wearing a body of beastskin clothes, in his hand… His left hand and right hand were both unexpectedly holding a weapon. In the right hand is a spear flickering a silver light… That aura, could very likely be a silver equipment! In his left hand is a longsword flowing with a golden glow. From its shape it should be a two-handed sword, its aura…</p>
<p>That is a gold equipment!</p>
<p>Not only is he holding two weapons at the same time, one of them is even a gold equipment. Even in all of China there are only a handful of gold equipment right now.</p>
<p>If they knew that the spear in Ling Chen’s right hand is Soaring Cloud that is currently on the China weapon ranking list, who knows what their reactions would be.</p>
<p>The players of the Black Flame Alliance and the Battle Alliance all looked at each other, no one could say anything. Even the expressionless Xiao Qiufeng had an expression of shock, his eyes tightly staring at Ling Chen. He cannot believe what he saw, Mystic Moon has only opened for a couple of days, how can there be a player that possesses such terrifying attack strength! He is holding two weapons… and they are even two weapons of a different kind, a spear and a long sword, it should be that they’re both supposed to be held with both hands! What made him even more shocked is that attack that Ling Chen used to kill the Gold War Bear. He actually used the two weapons in his hands to each separately launch two different skills. One is “Full Power Strike” of apprentice warriors, he recognises it. The other is an attack that he’s never heard of that dealt almost 6000 damage, but this was not the most important thing. The most important thing is that he used his two hands to simultaneously launch two different skills!! And he did it so easily and casually, without pausing or awkwardness.</p>
<p>One cannot do two things at the same time, this is common knowledge. There are definitely very few people in this world that can do two different things wholeheartedly, like drawing a circle and a square at the same time. In the virtual game world, the activation of skills requires one to use their minds to control it, at the same time launching the skill also requires the corresponding body movements. Not talking about how abnormal of a phenomenon it is to wield 2 two handed weapons with both hands and simultaneously launching two skills at the same time… To achieve this, he needs to simultaneously control the activation of the two skills and also control the movements of his left and right limbs at the same time. And yet he is able to do this so casually — How terrifying is his mental control ability!</p>
<p>Who is this person… If this is a person on the Heaven Ranking I should be able to recognise him right away! But regardless if it’s the Heaven Ranking or the Earth Ranking, they both don’t seem to contain the existence of this person!</p>
<p>That spear in his hand… That aura is a lot stronger compared to a silver equipment. Wait a sec, that spear… Could it be Soaring Cloud on the equipment ranking list!?</p>
<p>“Did anyone film that?” Xiao Qiufeng asked in a low voice while staring at Ling Chen.</p>
<p>The shield guard beside him seemed to have just returned to his senses, saying with a trembling voice: “N… no, it was so quick, how could anyone have been able to film it down. This person… Who is this person… Is he really a player? That attack… 5… over 5000 damage… Am, am I seeing things.”</p>
<p>Xiao Qiufeng: “…”</p>
<p>Following the fall of the Gold War Bear, a large pile of gold coins and different kinds of items rained down from its body and fell beside its corpse. When that flash of golden light rose up everyone’s gaze focused at Ling Chen’s feet… There, is clearly an upper garment flashing a golden glow.</p>
<p>Gold equipment!!</p>
<p>The flashing golden aura practically blinded the eyes of all of the Black Flame Alliance and Battle Alliance players. At the current stage, even silver equipment is still something that only exists in legends. Gold equipment… that could even be called a mythical item. This is the first time that each of them has seen a Gold equipment with their own eyes. Even though their hearts are still rapidly pounding from that shocking scene, their gazes were already filled with a deep desire and greed, some were even drooling from their mouths.</p>
<p>“Gold… Gold equipment! It dropped a Gold equipment!” One of Black Flame Alliance’s players said with a shaky voice while wiping his drool.</p>
<p>“Shut up, it’s not like I don’t have eyes!” Black Flame Bow said while biting his teeth. He opened his eyes wide, staring at that piece of armor emitting a golden colour, his eyes filled with greed. But… that player beside the gold equipment, he is a monster that used only 2 seconds to deal with a Lord BOSS and can deal over 1000 damage with one attack!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen completely ignored the trembling and greedy gazes of these players, treating them entirely like they didn’t exist, taking his time to pick up this golden armor.</p>
<p>[Golden Stitched Garment]: Type: Upper Garment, Grade: Gold, Equipment Requirements: Any class LV10 or above. An outer garment ingrained with gorgeous gold stitching, possesses a mysterious power. Attributes: Defense+30, Strength+5, Agility+5, When attacked there is a 3% chance of reducing damage by 50%.</p>
<p>Very good!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen directly took off his Beastskin cloth and equipped this gold grade Golden Stitched Garment on his body. Instantly he felt his stats grow again. His current defense is entirely enough to make shield guards of the same level eat his dust.</p>
<p>Watching Ling Chen equip that gold equipment on his body, those players in the middle of a trance once again swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>At the current stage even if it’s a Lord BOSS, the chances of it dropping a gold equipment are still relatively small. The drop rate and the quality of drops after a BOSS is killed are not only related to the luck value of the person that killed it, but is also greatly related to the level of the person, the amount of people and etc. Generally speaking, the lower your level and the lower the number of people, the easier it is for high quality equipment to drop. This Gold War Bear was killed by Ling Chen alone in virtually an instant, dropping a gold equipment can be considered normal. Just like when he killed a LV10 Celestial BOSS at LV5 by himself in the underground space… What that triggered was a truly magnificent drop. All kinds of amazing items appeared, pretty much all of the items that could have been dropped by the Greedy Giant Toad were dropped.</p>
<p>The Gold War Bear dropped a total of 13 gold coins and 6 orange potions. Besides a Golden Stitched Garment, there is also a pair of Copper grade magic shoes for apprentice elemental mages. He took a casual glance at it and then put it into his bag. The very last is an earth yellow crystal shard.</p>
<p>Energy Crystal!!</p>
<p>[Elementary Defense Crystal]: Type: Energy Crystal, Grade: Elementary, Attribute: Earth, Effect: Defense+6%.</p>
<p>The Novice Village’s item shop only has beginner energy crystals, and they are particularly expensive. Even up until now it is hard for regular players to have saved up the gold to buy any beginner energy crystal. As for Ling Chen having an energy orb… well, not everybody is able to meet and exterminate a Celestial BOSS.</p>
<p>Directly socketing this elementary energy crystal into the second socket of Lunar Scourge, his defense once again increased. Ling Chen then went around the Gold War Bear’s body, walking towards Soaring Cloud that was stuck into the ground on an angle far away after “Shooting Soaring Cloud”. When he walked up to Soaring Cloud the effect of Soul Sacrifice also disappeared at that moment. Ling Chen casually drank an orange potion, returning his HP back to 201.</p>
<p>Every person clearly saw that the attack that dealt over 5000 damage in an instant was the last attack from throwing this spear out… Obviously, this should be a skill from the spear, a terrifying skill thats damage is greater than all currently known skills at this stage! And items that can have skills, at the very least need to be Celestial grade! And the only piece of equipment on the equipment ranking chart… is precisely a Celestial grade spear.</p>
<p>Terrifying attack strength, a terrifying skill… Could it be that this spear is that “Soaring Cloud” that has already become world famous!? And this person… is the owner of Soaring Cloud… Ling Tian.</p>
<p>“That spear, may be Soaring Cloud, that is a Celestial item!!” A Black Flame Alliance player said excitedly. Soaring Cloud, that very first, and only piece of Celestial equipment that shook the entire world when it appeared.</p>
<p>Black Flame Bow’s expression continuously shifted. Finally, he bit his teeth and shouted with a low voice: “Go!!!”</p>
<p>He witnessed with his own eyes this person’s terror. But the allure of a Celestial item was great to the point that people simply could not resist it! He took a look at his party with a whole 30 people, in the end still releasing this command that is destined to make him regret it.</p>
<p>Under his command, the players of the Black Flame Alliance were first dazed and then understood what he meant. They moved swiftly and all charged forward together. The moment that Ling Chen grasped Soaring Cloud and pulled it out, the 30 Black Flame Alliance players all had already tightly surrounded him, blocking all of his possible paths of retreat. The elemental mages in the back assumed the pose of chanting beginner magic, the archers also all lined up together and pull apart their bow strings. All kinds of different weapons flashed out, all pointing straight at Ling Chen.</p>
<p>That face of Battle Alliance’s shield guard changed, he hurriedly said: “Leader, they…”</p>
<p>“Don’t interfere.” Xia Qiufeng said expressionlessly. He narrowed his eyes, gradually saying in a low voice: “Greed, truly is the scariest thing, it can make people become even dumber than pigs. They’ve already forgotten that they themselves do not have the ability to defeat a LV10 Lord BOSS, yet now they are contriving against this person that practically insta-killed a Lord BOSS.”</p>
<p>“But, they have a whole 30 people. It’s very likely that the person has such terrifying attack strength because of his equipment… That spear could be Soaring Cloud on the weapon ranking chart, but his HP might be about the same as ours. If just a couple of these people hit him, it will kill him! If that person dies, he might drop that amazing equipment…”</p>
<p>The lead shield guard wanted to continue speaking but seeing Xiao Qiufeng’s cold gaze he hurriedly shut his mouth, not daring to speak anymore.</p>
<p>“You have two choices. Either you hand over the two weapons in your hands and that golden armor on you body and we will let you peacefully leave. Or you can wait for us to kill you and then go pick them up ourselves. Be sensible, us Black Flame Alliance taking a liking to your equipment is your honour!” Black Flame Bow said with a fierce face. What he thought was the same thing as Battle Alliance’s lead shield guard, so even though he was still deeply afraid of Ling Chen, in his heart when he said this, he still had a bit of confidence.</p>
<p>He doesn’t believe that his HP is as crazy as his attack and can take the attack of all of the 30 people that were present.</p>
<p>Ling Chen slowly held Soaring Cloud in his hand. Listening to Black Flame Bow’s words he did not respond, instead he slightly lifted his head and then lightly took a step forward…</p>
<p>Slash!!</p>
<p>Slash!!</p>
<p>Following that step that he took, a light yellow and a light silver arc simultaneously swept towards his two sides… Those are the “Crescent Slashs” launched at the same time by Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud.</p>
<p>Crescent Slash that had reached max level can envelop a 4 meter area in the attacking direction, and it can hit a total of 5 targets. Simultaneously releasing two Crescent Slashes towards his left and right, the enveloped area of attack is a whole 8 meters! Ling Chen may have only taken what looked like an ordinary little step, but it is exactly this little step that allowed his left and right Crescent Slashes to each sweep through the five people on both sides closely surrounding him…</p>
<p>-309, -602, -331, -312, -302, -311, -622, -308, -313, -608!</p>
<p>Two sword arcs, 10 damage values floating up at the same time.</p>
<p>The HP of 10 apprentice warriors and apprentice assassins that were swept by Ling Chen’s Crescent Slashes were instantly emptied. After a short pause they all fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Killing ten people in a step!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Those presumptuous words of Black Flame Bow had just ended, and none of them saw clearly what had happened. They only saw two flamboyant arcs of light suddenly sweep past the 10 people, and just like that, the 10 fell down.</p>
<p>10 people in an instant! What terrifying scene this is.</p>
<p>Dozens pairs of pupils sharply contracted at the same moment.</p>
<p>“Fast!” Xiao Qiufeng exclaimed in his heart. His profession is also apprentice warrior, the attack just now was clearly the basic skill of apprentice warriors, Crescent Slash. But those two Crescent Slashes just now were the most stunning that he’d ever seen… No one could see clearly his hand movements, like a flash of lightning the two Crescent Slashes had already been unleashed. This kind of hand movement speed made even him feel his heartbeat quicken. He didn’t know who could dodge his close range attacks with this kind of hand speed… At least he knew he cannot!</p>
<p>This person, exactly who is he!</p>
<p>Black Flame Bow had just finished shouting his threat and in the blink of an eye, 10 Black Flame Alliance players fell over. Black Flame Alliance’s players were all immediately stunned… Towards regular players, this short moment of blankness couldn’t be considered much, but for apex masters, one moment is enough to determine life and death. At the instant that they returned to their senses, Ling Chen once again to a step forward, his two hands striking out like lightning again, the seconds round of Crescent Slashes cutting towards both sides and sweeping over. At the Novice Village there is no judgement for crime value for killing players, so he was killing them without any worry… And even if there was, he would still not hold back at all.</p>
<p>Bam, bam, bam, bam…</p>
<p>The last 3 apprentice assassins were also killed with 1 hit. The 3 shield guards swept by the other Crescent Slash also entered a critical state. Only now did the Black Flame Alliance players, as if waking up from a dream, look at the corpses that had covered the ground in an instant. They felt numerous gusts of cold air traversing through their bodies, making them feel a series of chills from their skin to their organs.</p>
<p>Being hit at the tip of his toes by a falling corpse, the entire body of Black Flame Bow trembled as if suddenly woke up from a nightmare, “Shields… All shields go and block him! Archers and mages immediately concentrate your fire! Immediately!!” he hoarsely yelled while hurriedly retreated. Before he could react there were already a dozen bodies on the ground… This person… is he a player or a demon!!</p>
<p>Under his command the 6 shield guards in the group all crazily charged forward, charging at Ling Chen from different directions, attempting to use their bodies to block all of his positions of displacement. As long as they can temporarily restrict his movements, the concentrated attacks of the archers and mages will definitely be able to take his life within a second.</p>
<p>But, if Ling Chen was so easy to deal with, he would not be Ling Chen then. At a LV5 condition he is able to kill a LV10 Celestial BOSS. How would the current him think anything of these harmless trash… No matter how much trash there is, they are still trash!</p>
<p>When the shield guards charged over to Ling Chen’s body, he had already moved away rapidly, another two Crescent Slashes sweeping in both directions at the same time. A 4 meter attack area, before these shield guards could even get close to him they had all already been hit. The 3 shield guards from before in critical condition all fell down, and the HP of the other 3 shield guards were also almost instantly cleared… With Ling Chen’s attack strength, within these players, only shield guards with high HP and defence could just barely take one of his attacks and not die.</p>
<p>“Careful!” At the same time that Ling Chen exterminated the 3 shield guards, Xiao Qiufeng knit his eyebrows and almost shouted out with a low voice. When Ling Chen launches an attack his body will also have a brief moment of stillness, and it is exactly at this moment that the first attack wave of the 10 archers and mages suddenly arrived… 10 people launching an attack together and all focusing on Ling Chen, this kind of concentrated attack simply cannot be dodged.</p>
<p>Fwoosh, fwoosh…</p>
<p>The sound of flying arrows shot past the sides of everyone’s ear. Right when everyone thought that Ling Chen would be hit by at least over half of the arrows and elemental bullets, they all suddenly felt like the scenery in front of them blurr. The figure surrounded by arrows and elemental bullets produced an abnormal distortion and illusion, and then almost bizarrely moved three positions to the right while they are all absentminded.</p>
<p>All of the arrows and elemental bullets all passed through the location of their target and then powerlessly disappeared thereafter reaching the limit of their attack range. And the target of these arrows and elemental bullets… Ling Chen was standing there completely unharmed, on his body not a single damage value appeared.</p>
<p>None of these arrows and elemental bullets actually hit him!! The situation at that time, exactly how did he avoid it… The Battle Alliance players that witnessed this all let out a cry of disbelief in their hearts.</p>
<p>I actually couldn’t see his movements clearly… not at all! Xiao Qiufeng’s hands slightly clenched, his forehead also tightening. That scene just now gave him too much shock. Being able to be listed number 7 in the Heaven Ranking, his combat awareness is incredibly strong. This entire time he was tightly staring at all of Ling Chen’s movements… But even under this kind of focus, he actually didn’t see clearly exactly how Ling Chen had dodged so many arrows and magic attacks in an instant.</p>
<p>Evading the arrows and magic did not mean that Ling Chen is safe. The moment that he steadied himself, the last two apprentice warriors of Black Flame Alliance simultaneously attacked him from behind. After shifting positions, the bodies of regular people at this time should be unstable, and shouldn’t be able to rapidly changing positions again. These two attacks suddenly coming from behind are simply impossible to avoid.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>That sound of metal clashing made even Xiao Qiufeng’s heart jump with it.</p>
<p>The attacks of the two apprentice warriors did not land on Ling Chen’s body, instead Soaring Cloud had landed on the target that he had suddenly swung behind him. The silver body of the spear firmly held onto the two steel swords, making them unable to advance even an inch. While the two warriors were completely dazed, Ling Chen’s Sand Blade arrived following the turning of his body, a Crescent Slash sweeping into their bodies.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, insta-kill!</p>
<p>“P…Parry! And it’s even while his back was facing towards them, simultaneously parrying two weapons!” This time Xia Qiufeng finally could no longer maintain his composure, his usually very cold face right now revealed deep shock.</p>
<p>As an ultimate expert of the sword, Xia Qiufeng understands better than anyone else how hard it is to trigger “parry” for a weapon. Even people who have attained pinnacle control towards a weapons find it difficult to divert their attention in intense combat to grasp that instantaneous parry point. To purposely trigger parry with your back facing the attack is even harder. To parry two weapons while your back is facing them, that requires a countless amount of practice to be able to step on this kind of bullshit luck.</p>
<p>Is it luck, or coincidence?</p>
<p>With the separation of the iron mask, Xiao Qiufeng was unable to see the expression of that face under the mask. But, recalling his simple, casual and smooth movements like water, recalling that he can use two weapons to simultaneously activate two different skills or the same skill, his hand movements that are god knows how many times faster than regular players… The voice in his heart told him that the parry just now, seems… to not be a simple coincidence!</p>
<p>If it really isn’t a coincidence, then this person…</p>
<p>He is a monster!!</p>
<p>Exactly who is he!! Why have I never heard of any rumours regarding this person!</p>
<p>Next, is Ling Chen’s retaliating time. He turned around launching an attack, the two shield guards in critical state were all insta-killed. He then headed straight for the archers. The attack area of a Crescent Slash is already pretty large, simultaneously using 2 Crescent Slashes is entirely doubling the attack area, it can lock onto double the amount of targets. The archers were all standing together, as if waiting to go reincarnate together.</p>
<p>Ling Chen dashed forward, a Crescent Slash simultaneously sweeping towards the left and right bringing up 5 screams of despair. How could these brittle archers possibly withstand Ling Chen’s attack, they were all insta-killed. After the archers, are the completely trembling elemental mages. Seeing Ling Chen approach they all subconsciously turned around and ran away in horror. In just a couple seconds of time, a 30 people group only had the remainings of a couple of fragile magicians, who could withstand this kind of mental impact.</p>
<p>But, even if they regret it now, it is simply too late. Ling Chen moved like a gale of wind. Two different arcs of light rose up in front of him enveloping all of the 5 elemental mages within.</p>
<p>-328, -329, -325, -652, -318!</p>
<p>With the brittle health of apprentice mages, the amount of HP they can have at this level will not surpass 200. Ling Chen’s one attack was more than enough to make them die twice. The last Crescent Slash also made sure that all of the elemental mages are killed in action.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s movements finally stopped. He stood there, a sword and a spear in hand, the ground around him had one after another corpses sprawled in different directions along with all of the equipment that they dropped. In the Mystic Moon world, even if it’s the Novice Village, after death there are still the rules of level and equipment dropping.</p>
<p>The corpses lying on the ground totalled 29… Black Flame Alliance’s 30 player’s currently only had the remaining Black Flame Bow who was standing far away with his entire body trembling in fear.</p>
<p>This person… he is a monster!! The veins on Black Flame Bow’s two hands that were tightly holding onto his longbow pulsed. He felt that his entire heart had intensely curled up and was about to burst at any moment. 29 people were just like that cleanly swept away in the blink of an eye. Right now he still hasn’t completely recovered, he even wondered if everything that had just happened was real or not.</p>
<p>He could not see this person’s name, could not see his appearance… He even hasn’t heard him emit a single sound. Just like a silent, faceless grim reaper!</p>
<p>“You, you…” Black Flame Bow’s two legs were shivering, this is his first time being so afraid of a person in a game world. Because this person is more terrifying than any player, any BOSS that he has ever seen. His feet retreated, and the same time fleeing in fear while releasing a trembling shout: “Messing with Black Flame Alliance, you… You will definitely regret it!”</p>
<p>Watching Black Flame Bow fleeing in a panic, a hint of disdain flashed across Ling Chen’s eyes. He did not chase him, instead grabbing Soaring Cloud, a “Shooting Soaring Cloud” throwing forward.</p>
<p>Fwoosh!!</p>
<p>-1700!</p>
<p>The silver spear flashed by like a shooting star, piercing through the running away Black Flame Bow’s body, bringing up a yellow damage value.</p>
<p>Another critical hit! Having the Heartless Orb, the appearance of critical hits is starting to appear overly regularly.</p>
<p>Black Flame Bow who was in the middle of running was shot down and started to roll, after a couple of rolls on the ground he lay there without any more movements. After a short moment he turned into a white light and disappeared from there.</p>
<p>After flying outwards, Soaring Cloud pierced into the ground on an angle. Its position from Battle Alliance’s players was only a short 5 meter distance. Ling Chen moved his foot, leisurely walking towards Soaring Cloud. This distance between him and Soaring Cloud is 15 meters. And while he was walking towards Soaring Cloud, towards this Celestial item that’s allure was simply too great to resist and was right in front of them, not a single one of Battle Alliance’s players dared to attempt to approach Soaring Cloud. They all carried a gaze of fear, watching Ling Chen step by step get closer. None of them doubted that whoever dared to take half a step towards Soaring Cloud would be the next person to die by his hands. There would be no escape.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Picking up Soaring Cloud, Ling Chen put away his two weapons. Taking out the map of the Novice Village and glancing at it, he then started walking towards the north-western direction. Currently what he needs the most is to raise his level to LV10, he couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to anything else. If he stayed here there would definitely be wave after wave of people coming to disturb him — For example the Black Flame Alliance just now, right now he can only go look for the territory of other LV10 creatures.</p>
<p>“You are Ling Tian?” Seeing that he is about to leave, Xiao Qiufeng could no longer maintain silence, taking a step forward and asking.</p>
<p>He did not gain any response… Ling Chen’s footsteps didn’t even have any sort of pause, he didn’t even turn his head around, walking forward in a straight line. In fact, from the very beginning he never even glanced towards them, completely ignoring their existence.</p>
<p>“What an arrogant person!” The lead shield guard of the Battle Alliance said with a frown. The great Xiao Qiufeng taking the initiative to speak to him and yet he didn’t pay him any attention. More than just arrogant, in their eyes his arrogance practically had no limits.</p>
<p>“He has the qualifications to be arrogant.” After not gaining a response, Xiao Qiufeng did not continue to speak, silently watching him leave and then letting out a muffled exclamation: “The vast China truly is filled with crouching tigers and hidden dragons. Every year the Heaven Ranking and Earth Ranking will always change, but those few people ranked at the very top almost never change… But this time, a big change might occur to the Heaven Ranking. (TL: Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 卧虎藏龙, the movie generally used as a description of a place saying that it is filled with people of talent. These people of talent can be on the surface or hidden. Hence the crouching and hiding.)</p>
<p>The shield guard was startled and then immediately said unconvinced: “Humph, he only stepped on some kind of dogshit luck and gained a Celestial item, that’s it. If leader had the same equipment destroying him would be easy as pie. His arrogance can only be at this time, when the Heaven Ranking and Earth Ranking experts all start to develop there will be no place for him to be arrogant!” (TL: Stepping on dogshit luck, getting very lucky… I don’t know, there’s most likely some kind of story for this.)</p>
<p>“…” Xiao Qiufeng shook his head: “He is more than just having powerful equipment. Maybe he… is a person even scarier than [Yan Huang Alliance]’s ‘Sword Emperor’ and [The Dark Night]’s ‘Death God’.</p>
<p>Remembering those completely unseeable movements that he used to evade the concentrated arrows and magic attacks, and that backwards parry against the attacks of those two warriors in that kind of dangerous situation… Also that faint feeling that he emitted that made his heart feel an inexplicable chill… Xiao Qiufeng’s heart was entirely unable to calm down, this is definitely not a persons whose strength simply depends on his equipment… Then again, without extremely powerful strength, how could he obtain this kind of equipment that at the novice stage could be considered a cheat.</p>
<p>This person… exactly who is he!</p>
<p>“E…Even scarier than ‘Sword Emperor’ and “Death God’? Th, th… that’s not possible right. They are the world recognised only two SS rank experts in China.” The shield guard said unable to believe Xia Qiufeng’s word.</p>
<p>“Brother!!”</p>
<p>A series of crisp cries came from behind. Hearing this voice Xiao Qiufeng’s rigid expression eased down, turning around and looking towards that girl girl jogging over.</p>
<p>The girl is 16, 17 years of age, wearing a slightly tight light red apprentice elemental mage robe on her body, outlining her thin waist and perky breasts, showcasing her curvaceous body. What was clearly just an ordinary mage robe, worn on her body had an elegant and refined feeling. Only 16, 17 years of age, but she had clearly developed early, a sexy figure with amazing curves, bright delicate rosy lips, a perfect, straight, delicate nose, long, curled black eyelashes, an unmatched beauty with a stunningness that could throw the world into disorder. Matched with her smooth fair skin and vibrant beauty she had a unique aura of liveliness and a youthful charm.</p>
<p>“Princess.” The arrival of this girl made the eye’s of everyone light up, but then immediately lower their heads and respectfully greet her. Because she is the only daughter of the leader of the Battle Alliance in reality, Battle Alliance’s princess that has gathered the love of everyone since she was little, and also the little sister of the game world’s Battle Alliance’s leader Xiao Qiufeng. Incredibly luckily, this pair of brother and sister were actually placed in the same novice village at the novice stage.</p>
<p>“Didn’t they say that a Lord BOSS appeared? Where is it where is it?” The girl jogged before Xia Qiufeng, lifting her head and looking around the surroundings, her beautiful face filled with excitement… Seemingly never having thought of the scariness of a Lord BOSS.</p>
<p>“Already dead.” Xiao Qiufeng pointed at the corpse of the Gold War Bear that hadn’t disappeared yet.</p>
<p>“Ah? Already dead!?” The girl’s soft lips widened, releasing a series of exclamations: “Woah!! Brother! You guys are really too amazing! Actually dealing with the Lord BOSS so quickly! Truly my most amazing big brother! Oh right right, did it drop anything good, is there anything suitable for me to use. The staff that I’m using is still really basic!”</p>
<p>Xiao Qiufeng: “… We didn’t kill it, it was someone else.”</p>
<p>“Someone else?” The girl paused for a moment, “Is it that someone else stole its ownership… Is it that the other side had more people? Or else how could they beat big brother.”</p>
<p>Xiao Qiufeng shook his head saying with a sigh: “It’s not like that. The reality is that we didn’t even move, that Lord BOSS was killed by a person… just one person, and it was practically an insta-kill.</p>
<p>“Ah?” The girl widened her eyes, her face filled with disbelief. How could there be a Lord BOSS that could be insta-killed by a person.</p>
<p>“This is something that you wouldn’t believe unless you saw it with your own eyes. Even though this person’s name has never been heard of before, but from the weapon ranking list and his current mannerism, it doesn’t seem like he will maintain a low profile. If it’s like this then you will know who he is very soon. Qi-Qi, you said this time you don’t want to join Battle Alliance, what’s going on?” Xiao Qiufeng asked with a frown.</p>
<p>The girl called “Qi-Qi” narrowed a pair of beautiful eyes with long, curved eyelashes saying very seriously: “I’ve already promised Mengxin jie-jie to join her “Heart’s Dream” studio!”</p>
<p>Xiao Qiufeng had a short moment of silence before opening his mouth saying: “You should also know that Yun Mengxin has absolutely no hope of winning the bet with her father. Garnering a fortune within 2 years that can match the current Yun family, this is simply fool’s talk. Not to mention her father has even purposely spread out this news, causing everybody to know about it. The Long family also already knows about it, Yun Mengxin will also definitely be isolated and without help because of this. She probably knows herself that there is simply no hope. This insignificantly weak struggle of her is only just that pitiable “intolerance” in her heart. There is absolutely no meaning in you helping her.”</p>
<p>Xia Qi pursed her lips saying defiantly: “I don’t care, I have to help Mengxin jie-jie!”</p>
<p>“I will not interfere with you. But you need to be clear that even if you are there, Battle Alliance will not intervene and help.” Xiao Qiufeng said with a serious expression.</p>
<p>Xiao Qi pursed her lips, holding her arms and saying: “Brother, I’m not an insensible person, of course I won’t allow Battle Alliance to stand at the opposite side of the Yan Huang Alliance. Me helping Mengxin jie-jie is my own personal affair, it has nothing to do with Battle Alliance.”</p>
<p>Xiao Qiufeng: “…”</p>
<p>“Actually we all know that Mengxin jie-jie has no hope of succeeding. But, we will not give up! We all like Mengxin jie-jie, even if we know that it is impossible to succeed we still need to have the courage to fight back and not give up. So, we will use our method to continue working hard! We girls don’t want to be the victims of family benefit! Not only is it just me that thinks like this and is doing so… Su-Su and Mu jie will also join our side!” Xiao Qi gripped tight her little fists, biting her lips and saying firmly.</p>
<p>“Su-Su? Su family’s princess? That Mu jie-jie, could it be…” A hint of surprise flashed across Xiao Qiufeng’s face. He’s seen Yun Menxin before, he believes that she has the ability to steal the souls of men, with that person’s background being so infatuated with her can be considered a normal thing. But who knew that her charm was also so great amongst women. My little sister is willing to leave the Battle Alliance to help her, joining that little studio that is destined to have no future… Even Su family’s eldest daughter and the person call “Mu jie-jie” by Xiao Qi also…</p>
<p>Mu Bingyao — She is the “Ice Heart Demon” ranked 5th on the Heaven Ranking!</p>
<p>But… What they need to face, is the entire Yan Huang Alliance! Because that person, is the leader of the entire world’s biggest guild — the Yan Huang Alliance’s number one seat!</p>

<p>……………………</p>
<p>[Little Raccoon]: Type: Beast, Level: LV10, HP: 310, A type of mammal that belongs to the raccoon species, possesses a very developed foot sense, it is accustomed to using its front paws to hunt and attack. Hates gan tsui mian. (TL: 干脆面, gan tsui mian, dried crisp noodles. In China there is something called Little Raccoon Dried Crisp Noodles，小浣熊干脆面 that was apparently crazy popular in schools in the 90s because there were collectible cards of the 108 outlaws from Water Margin, Shui Hu Zhuan.)</p>
<p>On the soft grass a bunch of little raccoons leisurely walked around. They didn’t even have any reaction when Ling Chen walked into their territory, clearly not the attack on sight type of creatures. Ling Chen scanned the surroundings, not seeing the existence of other players he called out his two weapons and charged straight up, cutting towards the little raccoons.</p>
<p>“Fire of Rage!”</p>
<p>Shing! Shing!!</p>
<p>-358, -356, -718…</p>
<p>He charged straight at the most concentrated area of raccoons, a Crescent Slash to the left and right, simultaneously killing four little raccoons. With his current attack strength, under the effect of Fire of Rage he can directly oneshot a little raccoon without even a critical hit with a one hand attack. Both hands together, every round of attack caused a small group of little raccoons to fall down. The temperament of little raccoons is gentle, belonging to the type of creatures that only attacks when attacked, it will not automatically attack if no one attacks it. Therefore against Ling Chen that can insta-kill them, every little raccoon that died didn’t even have the chance to attack.</p>
<p>Just like this, his two hands simultaneously released Crescent Slashes, quickly clearing the HP of one after another little raccoons, he really didn’t feel any pressure at all. The territory of these little raccoons is truly an amazing farming ground, the area is vast and the spawn time is not slow… But the speed that Ling Chen cleared these little raccoons was honestly too shocking. Every dozen minutes Ling Chen’s movements would be forced to stop, waiting for the next wave of little raccoons to appear.</p>
<p>While the majority of players were forming parties and farming LV7 black rabbits or LV8 goblins, who would have thought that there is actually a person going to the territory of LV10 creatures and wreaking havoc by himself, and his efficiency is scarily shocking. One person, practically taking an entire farming map for himself. Under the negative effects of “Heaven’s Jealousy”, Ling Chen’s levelling difficulty was double of other players. But he has the ability to one shot LV10 creatures, has two weapons and has max level skills… His LV9 experience bar was still rising at a relatively rapid speed. (TL: That LV8 goblin is really random)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Not long after Ling Chen killed the Gold War Bear, Mystic Moon’s Chinese forum had a very eye-catching post:</p>
<p>“We saw that Ling Tian that has that “Soaring Cloud” on the weapon ranking list!! He is right in the No. 49554 Novice Village! Not only does he have Soaring Cloud, he also has a bunch of other Gold equipment! 5 minutes ago, the territory of the LV10 brown bears spawned a LV10 Lord BOSS. It was practically insta-killed by him! That attack dealt over 5000 damage!! Absolutely true! He should still be there right now, everybody go kill him and get Faerie and Gold equipment!!”</p>
<p>And then, are the reply posts…</p>
<p>“Insta-killing a LV10 Lord BOSS? Dealing 5000 damage? The fuck, can you at least have some IQ when you try to trick people, did you eat too much shit and choke on it!”</p>
<p>“Hello OP, can I ask which mental hospital you are from? Is it that you forgot to take your medicine today.”</p>
<p>“A bunch of Gold equipment… You think Gold equipment is bak-choi!!” (TL: Saying something is bak-choi or some other vegetable is saying that it is very common.”</p>
<p>“You’ve seen Ling Tian, Ptui, and I’ve seen you’re little sister. Insta-killing a LV10 Lord BOSS, Ptui, and I insta-killed your father. Dealing 5000 damage? Your mom, it’s bad enough that you’re coming here to show off your IQ, you also want to treat us as a retard like yourself?”</p>
<p>“OP’s ID belongs to Black Flame Alliance. No need to think about it, meeting Ling Tian might be real. They definitely wanted to take his equipment but then failed like miserable shits, so they’re using this kind of crappy idea to drag hatred towards Ling Tian. Black Flame Alliance only has this bit of ability… Although speaking of it why did they find a person with such a low IQ to make a post. Even saying things like insta-killing a Lord BOSS and dealing 5000 damage, Okay, my guess is also that he ate too much shit and choked on it.”</p>
<p>“Yuan Fang, how do you see this?”</p>
<p>“Yuan Fang thinks that this person’s ID was hacked, or else they would not release such a retarded speech. But we cannot exclude the possibility that it is this person’s psychosis acting up.” (TL: Psychosis)</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>This post was indeed posted by those insta-killed Black Flame Alliance players. Ling Chen’s scariness made them not have the balls to go mess with him again. After all, there are 100000 Novice Village’s, them having a couple dozen of people in the same Novice Village is already a relatively large scale, them going again is just suicide. Thus they wanted to use this kind of method to incite more people to go trouble him… But the result made them want to cry, not only does no one believe them, instead it even brought about a slew of ridicule and cursing.</p>
<p>Thinking back about it, if they didn’t experience and see it for themselves, they too wouldn’t believe that someone can insta-kill a Lord BOSS at the current stage and deal 5000 damage. If someone said so, they would also not believe it. And would even treat them like a lunatic. Even if they wanted to rebut, they were simply powerless because the killing of the Lord BOSS occurred in just the blink of an eye, they could not have been able to film it on time. The following attack by them was also dealt with like a gust of wind sweeping through falling leaves. They couldn’t even keep their lives, who would have the time to film.</p>
<p>The Battle Alliance player’s who were there and saw this post would also only maintain silence.</p>
<p>…………………..</p>
<p>“Ling Chen! Was there a conflict between you and Black Flame Alliance?” Yun Feng’s voice sounded from the communication device of Ling Chen who was in the middle of murdering little raccoons.</p>
<p>“Ya.” Ling Chen casually swung his hand, another 3 little raccoons falling in front of him. He then looked at his experience bar that had increased a bit. When he had just obtained Lunar Scourge, it’s negative effects made him very much want to take it off. But now, he realises how foolish his thoughts were at the time. The EXP that he needs to rise a level is double of other players, and levelling speed will also be half of the rest of the players; But one Gemini Orb made his levelling efficiency far more than double. His current levelling rate completely surpassed his state before obtaining Lunar Scourge.</p>
<p>“I see! Ha, you don’t know, Black Flame Alliance that group of idiots just released a post to pull hatred towards you. Saying that you have a body of equipment that can insta-kill a LV10 Lord BOSS, and can deal 5000 damage with one attack, hahahaha, I laughed my ass off. Even if they want to incite some greedy people to go mess with you they didn’t need to be so retarded by saying such retarded statements. Insta-killing a Lord BOSS, dealing 5000 damage, it’d be strange if people actually believed it, hahahaha. Black Flame Alliance is a big guild, at its peak condition it has hundreds of thousands members, but the IQ of the person that released this post is really worrying.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“I need to continue farming so don’t bother me for now.” Before Yun Feng could finish speaking Ling Chen had already cut off the connection, and then continuing his pace of murdering little raccoons. Continuing to stay in the same map and restlessly killing until the evening before disconnecting.</p>
<p>The instant that he left the Mystic Moon world, Lunar Scourge vanished from his wrist in a slightly flickering black light. But Ling Chen himself did not witness this scene.</p>
<p>The night veil lowering, after Ling Shui Ruo peacefully fell asleep, Ling Chen once again entered the world of Mystic Moon, appearing in the territory of the little raccoons. At the first moment he charged at the little raccoons that had already spawned across the entire area. With his current condition, there is no reason to not become the first person to leave the Novice Village.</p>
<p>The little raccoon territory that had finally calmed down once again sounded with a series of pitiful whimpers when little raccoons died. Lasting for a very long long time, Ling Chen’s experience bar also rose up bit by bit under the rapid deaths of the little raccoons. From 50% to 60%, and then to 80%… 90%… 95%…</p>
<p>From LV9 to LV10 is a relatively difficult process, the EXP required is more than the total experience required to level from LV1 to LV9. Ling Chen himself didn’t even realise how shocking his current levelling speed is… This is even under the negative impact of Lunar Scourge.</p>
<p>When Ling Chen’s experience reached 99% and was only a step away from LV10, a white light flashed by in the center of the little raccoon territory and a big raccoon double the size of regular raccoons spawned. It waved its front paws in a frenzy, it’s eyes releasing a fierce light, completely lacking of the gentleness of regular little raccoons.</p>
<p>[Big Raccoon]: Type: Beast, Level: LV10, Grade: 3 Star Elite, HP: 2500. Mutation of the little raccoon, has a large body and violent nature, will automatically attack any outside beings. Need to be careful of its sharp claws.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s gaze locked onto its body, he glanced at his current experience value, his eyes narrowing… I will use you, as a magnificent end to my time in the Novice Village!</p>
<p>“Fire of Rage!”</p>
<p>“Soul Sacrifice!”</p>
<p>“Shooting Soaring Cloud!!”</p>
<p>Under Fire of Rage and Soul Sacrifice, Ling Chen’s attack strength had risen to a point that made people tremble. Raising up Soaring Cloud, following the movement of Ling Chen’s body, it shot towards the newly spawned big raccoon.</p>
<p>Gwoosh!!</p>
<p>-2853!</p>
<p>Soaring Cloud pierced through the chest of the big raccoon and came out from its back, piercing into the soft grassland on an angle, a red damage value gradually fading over the big raccoon’s head…</p>
<p>300% damage, 15 meter flying distance, absolute hit… Shooting Soaring Cloud was undoubtedly the most powerful attack skill that Ling Chen currently possessed.</p>
<p>One attack, directly clearing all of its HP. Before even having a chance to get a clear look of this world the newly spawned big raccoon’s body stiffened, and then fell to the ground in a long whimpering sound.</p>
<p>“Ding, You have successfully killed LV10 3 star elite ‘Big Raccoon’, Fame+30, SP+30.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV10, HP+10, MP+10, gained 5 AP.</p>
<p>Under the sweet sound of the system notification, Ling Chen’s level finally reached LV10. But even if he levelled up, under the effect of “Soul Sacrifice” his HP did not recover, from this the extreme overbearingness of this skill can be seen. Ling Chen let out a long breath, walking to the big raccoon’s corpse hr picked up the only piece of equipment that it dropped.</p>
<p>[Silver Boots]: Type: Boot, Grade: Silver, Equipment Requirements: Any profession LV10 or above. Boots forged from silver, flickers a mysterious silver glow, Attributes: Defense+10, Strength+5, Agility+5, Movement Speed+10.</p>
<p>One shotting will without doubt increase that probability of dropping high grade equipment. This 3 star elite actually directly dropped a Silver equipment, this made Ling Chen a bit pleasantly surprised for a bit and then equip the Silver Boots without any hesitation. Like this, besides his upper garment and rings, all of the equipment on his body is at least silver grade. This is something that other player’s couldn’t even dream of.</p>
<p>Still placing all of the AP gained from levelling up into strength, like this even without any buffs, his basic attack strength has already surpassed 300! An extremely terrifying number.</p>
<p>Glancing at his attributes in satisfaction, Ling Chen left the little raccoon territory and headed straight for the Novice Village.</p>
<p>“Hello Chief, please send me to Forgotten continent.” Ling Chen came in front of the Village Chief and said straight to the point. Maybe the better choice is that he remains in the Novice Village for a period of time to look for some hidden elements, but in contrast he still chose to immediately leave the Novice Village, because the very first person to leave the Novice Village would very likely receive some special rewards.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s you young hero. Hm? You want to head towards Forgotten continent? You need to know that you need to reach LV10 to have the qualifications to head there… Wait, you… You’re actually already LV10!!” Suddenly seeing Ling Chen’s level the chief cried out in surprise. According to his calculations, the fastest these other world humans can leave the Novice Village is 2-3 days later.</p>
<p>“It really is too astonishing, actually reaching LV10 so quickly. You are definitely a very amazing hero.” The chief complimented saying. “Forgotten continent, that is a place that makes people cherish the memory of it. Right now you do indeed possess the qualifications to head towards Forgotten continent, there you will have a new beginning and official class. Although, before that, there is something that I need to tell you. Until now, of the entire Mystic Moon world’s outer islands there is still not yet an other world human like you who has left. If you leave now, you will become the first other world hero to leave the Novice Village!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“I did not expect such a hero to actually appear in the place that I stay, it really makes me proud and thrilled. Then, before you leave, I have something that needs to be given to you, this item can only be given to the first person to leave the Novice Village.”</p>
<p>Finishing speaking, the village chief took out a round item the size of a palm… That is clear an insignia.</p>
<p>Chinese meme lesson time. About the Yuan Fang thing I’ve discovered what it is. You might remember that Yuan Fang appeared in that reaction chapter for Soaring Cloud (CH35), Yuan Fang is a Chinese meme originating from a tv series call 神探狄仁杰 （Detective Dee). Just think of Dee as Sherlock and Yuan Fang as a Watson that can kick your ass. A common thing that Dee asks Yuan Fang is “Yuan Fang, what do you think?” and Yuan Fang’s general response is always stuff like “Yuan Fang thinks that there is something strange about this. There must be a big secret behind this.” So a general, useless no shit captain obvious response. And this is your Chinese meme lesson for today.)</p>
<p>(R: … don’t compare them to Sherlock and Watson pls)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Here, take this. This is a badge symbolizing courage and honor, and only you are qualifed to have it. It will bring you great luck if you equip it,” said the chief as he handed the badge to Ling Chen.</p>
<p>[Proof of Courage]: Type: Badge, Grade: None, Equipment Requirements: The first to leave Novice Village, cannot be traded, and will disappear if thrown away. Gifted to the first player to leave the Novice Village as a marker of honor, Attributes: Luck+1, Comprehension+1.</p>
<p>So it was a badge…and it even adds Luck and Comprehension!</p>
<p>Although it’s not impossible to raise Luck and Comprehension, it is still a very difficult thing to do. Even increasing them by one is difficult because they are innate attributes. They will not change with one’s level or job class, and normal equipment will definitely not add to innate attributes. Luck and Comprehension will only improve with unique rewards that are only obtained by completing ‘special tasks’. However the chances of getting a ‘special task’ are very small, and the majority of the players will never get such an opportunity, even if they do, they still might not be able to complete the task.</p>
<p>For instance, this badge that adds one to both Luck and Comprehension, is something that solely the first player to leave the Novice Village can obtain.</p>
<p>“Thank you Chief,” Ling Chen politely replied as he took the badge and equipped it. However, he was still confused….it is said that this badge is only awarded to the first player to leave the Novice Village, but he has technically not yet left the Novice Village. Nevertheless the chief has already given the badge to me…is he not afraid of me just suddenly deciding to not go?</p>
<p>“Ha, ha, you truly deserve this badge. And yes, the place that you will be transferred to will be one of the main five cities of the Forgotten Continent, the Dragon City. When you get there, you should go meet the city chief and when he sees your badge he might be willing to give you some special tasks. So, do you want to leave for the Forgotten Continent right now? This is external region, it is not on the same area of the Forgotten Continent. So if you chose to leave here, then you will never be able to come back. It is best for you to complete any unfinished tasks you have here before leaving. I believe that even if you chose to go tomorrow, you will still be the first to leave Novice Village,” said the smiling chief.</p>
<p>After thinking for bit, Ling Chen asked: “chief, after hearing you talk about the Forgotten Continent, is it alright for me to ask a few question about that place?”</p>
<p>Nostalgia reflected upon the chief’s face as he started to state: “Yes, I have been to the Forgotten Continent when I was young, and I have completed my lifelong wish of traveling across it, but some things that happened in my later years has made me inclined to come here. You are the first to leave here, so ask whatever you want. I am very willing to answer all your questions.”</p>
<p>Nodding his head, Ling Chen asked: “What kind of place is the Dragon city?”</p>
<p>“The Dragon City is to the East of the Forgotten Continent, it is one of the five main cities of the Forgotten Continent. The five main cities are the Azure Dragon city of the east, the White Tiger city of west, the Vermilion Bird city of the south, the Black Tortoise city of the north, and the Forgotten city at the center. The land of the Forgotten Continent is extremely vast, and along with the five main cities, there are countless other cities, towns, and villages scatters across the land like stars in the night sky. And of course all of this is human territory. The power of humans is not very substantial, their strength is no where near that the the Beast clan, and it can not even be compared to the Ocean clan. But humans are able to obtain a land that is as vast as the Forgotten Continent in the world of Mythic Moon is because of two reasons: one, the human intelligence, and two, the protection of the Moon God Clan. And because of this reason, humans have developed an eternally unwavering faith in the Moon God Clan. After all, it is only due to the existence of the Moon God Clan which can oppress the ancient demons. Young one, you who come from a another world may not be able to understand our faith in the Moon God Clan, but when you get to the Forgotten Continent, or anywhere outside, do not say anything that would disrespect the Moon God Clan. And don’t do anything that would offend the Moon God Clan. Or else you will be dislikes and you may be ostracized.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “….”</p>
<p>Unintentionally, he took a brief look at the Luna Chain on his wrist. Tao Tie told him that to wear the Lune Chain was the same as to become the sworn enemy of the Moon God Clan. This was a fact that he can never hope to change.</p>
<p>But to become an enemy of the Moon God Clan was equivalent as to becoming the enemy of all of the Forgotten Continent!</p>
<p>The chief continued speak with an unchanging face: “The Dragon city that you will sent to is the most comfortable city of the Forgotten Continent, the people there are very passionate and friendly. The monsters in that area are also very weak, I believe you will definitely like it there. The Dragon city is rumored to be protected by the mysterious god Azure Dragon, which is part of the legendary mysterious god beast, so there are few things in this world that can threaten the peace of the Dragon city. And the other four cities also have the protection of their legendary guardians that they are named after. The Tiger city has the mysterious god White Tiger, the Bird city has the mysterious god Vermilion Bird, the Tortoise city has the mysterious god Black Tortoise, the central Forgotten city is protected by the strongest of the five saint destroyers of the Forgotten Continent—–the Kirin!”</p>
<p>“Five Saint Destroyer….There are five saint destroyers on the Forgotten Continent?” Ling Chen said with shock in his voice.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the chief responded while nodding his head: “saint destroyers are not only the strongest on the Forgotten Continent, they are at the top ranks of this world as well. The power held by these five saint destroyers can not be rivaled by any.”</p>
<p>“Who are the five?”</p>
<p>“One is the Kirin, it is one the first creatures said to be born in Mythic Moon, it symbolizes prosperity and protection, and it holds the strongest holy powers in this world. The other guardians of the four cities, Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, all have to obey its orders. It is also the most peaceful of the five saint destroyers. Rumor states that it is somewhere within the Forgotten City, but no one has seen it yet. Two is the Jinwu(Golden Crow), which is also called the sun crow, legend states that it is a divine creature birthed by the the sun high in the heavens. It can controls solar flame that is strong enough to incinerate all in this world. It holds the most calamitous abilities in the five sacred beast, but it also has a very fragile lifeforce. At the same time, it is the most fear nemesis of the monsters left by the ancient demon gods. The ten mysterious god beast will all tremble before it. However, there are precarious legends that state that the Jinwu’s root fire has already been extinguished many moons ago, and thus has disappeared in this world. Three is the Void Dragon God, it is part of the strongest species of beast on the Forgotten continent….it is at the top of the dragon clan. Not only does it bear the might that can destroy this land, but it also holds the power of calling upon the whole dragon clan. Even the Moon God Clan does not dare to disrespect it. Four is the divine guardian of the Moon God Clan—the Eight-wing Heaven Tiger. In the past it was the mount of the fierce Moon God, even though it is a beast, it has the same status as the three goddesses of the Moon God Clan Order, Destiny, and Freedom. Rumor has it that with just one roar, it can cause the skies to collapse and the land to split. Five is the king of the Ocean Clan—the Oceanic Rage Shark, it holds a colossal sized body and strength that can not be rivaled. Everything that is in or above the sea is under its control. There is no creature that can cause any threat to its might of the sea. If it is angered, then the whole ocean will turn.”</p>
<p>The chief took a short breath after introducing the five sacred beast of the Forgotten continent, and started again: “ The Kirin, the Golden Crow, the Void Dragon God , the Eight-wing Heaven Tiger, and the Oceanic Rage Shark are the strongest beasts of the Forgotten Continent and the sea surrounding it. They hold indomitable strength and everlasting lives. Their appearance was made possible by many unknown forces, growths, and evolutions. Expect for the Golden Crow, the other four sacred beast should still exist in this world, but the chance of encountering any one of them is extraordinary rare.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen meticulously memorized the names of the five sacred beast and all the other information, then asked: “Do the three goddess of the Moon God Clan also hold the power of Saint Destroyer?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered the chief as he nodded his head, “The Order goddess, the Freedom goddess, and the Destiny goddess also hold the top tiers of Saint Destroyer. Although they hold the same appearance as humans, they have already far surpassed human levels. After all the humans’ pinnacle stops at Mysterious God, and no matter how hard a human works they will never even touch a Saint Destroyer. However to get to the level of Mysterious God is already an almost impossible task for humans to complete. Since hundreds of thousands of years have passed, there has only been two or three that have reached the Mysterious God tier in human history. The goddesses bear a bloodline and strength that differs from the human. But it is not only just them, their Moon God messengers also hold powers of the Mysterious God—no, they surpass the Mysterious God level, and can be place in the middle of Mysterious God and Saint Destroyer. Ha, ha, you might feel surprised, but this is all true. The Moon God Clan is indeed omnipotent.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen signed a breath of cold air….The Saint Destroyer strength of the goddesses of the Moon God Clan, even their messengers have strengths that are at least of Mysterious God tier. This was such an almighty strength, in their eyes his power is perhaps even less than that of an ant.</p>
<p>But he who possesses the Lunar Scourge, is fated to become the enemy of the Moon God Clan….</p>
<p>“They could be considered the strongest of human,” Ling Chen inattentively soliloquized.</p>
<p>“Yes, if you view them as humans, then they are indeed the strongest of humans. Humans look up to and worship them, and they shoulder the preservation of all humans within the Forgotten Continent. If humans ever encounter any calamities, they will never abandon them. However they also will never interfere with disputes or wars that happen between humans. From within the ‘humans’, only the Night Demon Clan can oppose them. But the Night Demon Clan never involve themselves in any human activities, their only enemy is the Moon God Clan. It’s almost as if they hold a great vengeance that can never be alleviated towards the Moon God Clan. The Night Demon Clan are very enigmatic, no one knows where they are and why they hate the Moon God Clan. Although we have never seen proof of their existence, we know that they have regularly attacked the Moon God Clan. Thus all humans on the Forgotten Continent and the whole of the Moon God Clan view them as their nemesis. The humans of the Night Demon Clan are also very strong, and everytime they attack they bring great trouble to the Moon God Clan. But still they have never really caused any substantial threat to the Moon God Clan. And there exist no one else in this world that can cause any threat to the Moon God Clan, because that is an inconceivable thing to do….”</p>
<p>Suddenly the chief’s voice slowed, as if he had just remembered something else as a terrible disturbance flickered upon his face. He took a long breath as his voice began to deepen: “If I had to say that there was ever a human that could threaten the Moon God Clan, then there can only be…..Shura!”</p>
<p>“Shura?” Ling Chen said curiously.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Shura, is a devotion towards the ultimate strength that makes one give up all of their spirit, faith, and emotion in order to enter the way of ‘killing’. Once a human becomes a Shura, they will obtain a terrifying strength that makes them merciless and violent, caring only about bloodshed. Many moons ago, humans knew little about the Shura, so any legends back then concerning the Shura were treated as mere fantasy. Until ten thousand years ago when the first real Shura appeared.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…..”</p>
<p>“Legend has it that he borrowed the strength of an ancient item to enter the path of the Shura. However no one knows why exactly he was willing to give up everything in order to become a Shura. Some say that it was due to hate, and others say that he simply wanted to become stronger….but whatever the reason, a true Shura appeared. His appearance in Forgotten Continent was only for a brief time….but he killed one tenth of all the living beings on the Forgotten Continent.”</p>
<p>“Wh….What!?” Ling Chen replied with a great jolt.</p>
<p>Ling Chen does not know exactly how vast the land of the Forgotten Continent was, but the fact that it is able to hold several hundred million players means that it was definitely not small. There has to be countless humans, beasts, demons, and other living being on such an enormous land. And their numbers have to counted by the billions.</p>
<p>But just one Shura….killed one tenth of all the living beings on the Forgotten Continent….what a frightening number this is.</p>
<p>“You didn’t mishear me, it was indeed one tenth. This terrifying number is almost unbelieveable, such a number would send chills down anyone’s spine. One could not possibly imagine how horrifying the situation at that time could possibly have been without experiencing it themselves…. according to the legends, wherever the Shura passed became a living hell. Because of his emergence, the Forgotten Continent became a sea of corpses and all living being lived their lives terrified of him. And out of all those he killed, there also included thirty Oracles.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “ ! ! ! ! !”</p>
<p>Thirty Oracles…who hold power greater than the Mysterious God Grade! ?</p>
<p>“But in end, his strength and his violent ways lead to divine punishment. Numerous lightning stuck down from the heavens in hopes of destroying his body. At the same time, the three goddesses of the Moon God Clan united with the Void Dragon God to stop him….It is said that the battle lasted for three days and three nights. And at the sacrifice of one tenth of the land of the Forgotten Continent, they finally managed to destroy the ancient item that helped him to enter Shura’s path. However even though they managed to become the victors, the three goddesses were gravely injured and the Void Dragon God had to rest for a thousand years before healing….If they did not have heaven’s lightnings aiding them, even if they had united, they would not have won and would not have destroyed the Shura.”</p>
<p>After saying this, the Chief’s face was veiled in anguish as he stared at Ling Chen with a blank look in his eyes. But then he smiled and shook his head as he started again: “Ah, I really am getting older, now I can’t even keep my mouth under control. I am not supposed to tell you this. The Forgotten Continent has always been trying to hide this history and let the people forget the calamity of the Shura that happened ten thousand years ago. And now, there are few that know of this, even the Moon God Clan has declared that the Shura will never appear on the Forgotten Continent again. You don’t have to take in all that I just said.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded his head, but the word ‘Shura” is now deeply carved into his mind.</p>
<p>One human ravaged one tenth of all living things on the Forgotten Continent. One human under the attack of a myriad of lightnings from the heavens managed to battle the Void Dragon God and the three goddesses of the Moon God Clan alone. This level of merciless, violence, strength, and prestige…..</p>
<p>The name ‘Shura”, was not completely unfamiliar to Ling Chen. Right now in his bag, he held a piece of the sword used by the ‘Shura” that the Chief speaks of—- Shura Emperor Sword’s Broken Piece! And within the description of Shura Emperor Sword’s Broken Piece there was also one who became the incarnation of a Shura, the “Red Mystical Sword King, whose only reason for living was to slaughter, massacring the lives of countless beings, causing the world to fall into chaos. In the end bringing onto himself the punishment of the heavens, befalling the combined judgement of Saint Destroyer beast Void Dragon God and the three goddesses Fate, Order, Liberty, in the end dying under the hands of the 3 goddesses.” And after hearing the Chief speak about Shura , his heart trembled, because after understanding the strength of the three goddesses, he now clearly knew how terrifying of a task it was to battle the goddesses alone—–and the fact that he now held one piece of the sword used made his heart tremble more than ever before.</p>
<p>“I have unintentionally said so much, but anyway, young brave one, do you have any more questions? If you do not, then allow me to send you to the Forgotten Constituent,” said the Chief.</p>
<p>“I want to ask….besides the three goddesses and the guardian beast, how many more Oracles does the Moon God Clan have? I am only trying to fulfill my curiosity,” asked Ling Chen.</p>
<p>The Chief looked at him strangely and thought for a bit before replying: “It seems as if you care a lot of the Moon God Clan, ha ha, but that is not a bizarre thing. The Moon God Clan has around two hundred high leveled divine messengers, and they have all been sent all around the Forgotten Continent in order to maintain order. There is one Oracle in the Forgotten Continent that we have named the Forgotten Goddess. She may even be in the sky above us and looking at us talk right now. Ha,ha,ha,ha….and there are also many other lower grade Oracles that I do not know of.”</p>
<p>Two hundred high leveled Oracles….such a number made Ling Chen gasp, this was such an overwhelming strength. No wonder the Moon God Clan has the qualifications to control the entire Mystic Moon world…. any one of the Oracles have already reached the Mysterious God level. And it is indisputable that the three goddesses who stand at the top of the Moon God Clan have the capability to regime over all living beings.</p>
<p>Yet that Shura….using just the strength of a mere human to resist not only the three goddesses but also and the Void Dragon God….what a formidable human he must have been.</p>
<p>“Then how many more Mysterious God level beasts are there on the Forgotten Continent?” Ling Chen continued to ask. He wanted to understand exactly how powerful the Forgotten Continent was.</p>
<p>The Chief thought for while and answered: “The land of Forgotten Continent is extremely vast, so no one can be certain of how many Mysterious God level beast there are. After all it is very rare for a Mysterious God level beast to appear, so even without counting the ten ancient demons beasts, the Forgotten Continent should only have a number that is somewhere in the tens, including the guardian beasts that everyone knows of such as the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tiger along with the ten ancient demon beasts then there should be over twenty.”</p>
<p>“You speak of the ten ancient demon beasts, but what exactly is their history?” Ling Chen asked.</p>
<p>“The ten beasts appeared in ancient times where the leader of the Devil Clan raised ten of the greatest demons. But after the the Devil Clan was defeated, the ten ancient demon beasts concealed themselves into unknown parts of the Forgotten Continent and have never appeared again. They each are of the Mysterious God level, and the lands they have occupied are forbidden lands that no human dares to step in. The ten ancient demon beasts include: One, the Sky Demon Beast, it is the strongest one out of the ten and it holds a massive body with eight pairs of black feathered wings. It is rumored that it’s strength has surpassed Mysterious God level and near the Saint Destroyer level. Two is the Earth Demon Beast, legend states it hides under the highest mountain of the Forgotten Continent. It holds the power of the earth and its ability to use the earth to conceal itself can be rivaled by none. Three is the Tyrant Demon Beast who possesses the shape of a wolf. It holds a very violent behavior and likes to stay in dark environments because it is strongest under darkness. Four is the Shadow Demon Beast who bears the strongest dark powers and has always existed in the shadows. Five is the Flame Demon Beast who has the powerful ability to control devastating fires and lives a sea of flames. Although it’s fire ability is less than that of the Golden Crow, it the one of the ten ancient demon beasts that is least afraid of the Golden Crow. Six is the Rage Demon Beast, who is rumored to gather hatred from the souls of the dead. It is not afraid to light or dark powers, but it’s strength is unstable and varies from weak to strong. Sometimes it’s stronger than the Sky Demon Beast, and other times it will drop to the Heaven’s End level. Seven is the Wind Demon Beast, who was born from hurricane winds, and hold extremely strong wind type abilities, enabling it to freely travel across the skies and the lands. Eight is the Ice Demon Beast who develop from the freezing polar ice. With just the wave of one hand, it can freeze everything within a thousand miles. It should be somewhere in the glaciers of the far north. Nine is the War Demon Beast, it is the one that loves to battle the most out of the ten. It’s personality is also the most frenzied of the ten, because the only thing it desires is more strength. Ten is the Light Demon Beast who is the most placid of the Demon Beast. It is the weakest in terms of attacks, but it is also the one with the strongest defense, life, and recovery ability out of the ten. It likes to live under in the deep seas, and should be in somewhere on the ocean’s floor. These ten ancient demon beasts do not fear the Moon God Clan, because as long as they do not cause any great evils then the Moon God Clan will not disturb them. But at the same time, they are extremely afraid of the Golden Crow, and have not come out for all these years because they tremble at the possibility that the Golden Crow might still be alive somewhere on the Forgotten Continent. If you don’t include the Golden Crow, then there is nothing else they fear, because if all ten united their strengths, it would be an easy thing for them to defeat a Saint Destroyer. Thus, because of this reason, even the Saint Destroyers do not want to disturb them. Young one, you must remember to avoid traveling to the extreme lands of the Forgotten Continent, because those places may be where the Demon Beast rest.”</p>
<p>The Chief of Novice Village took extra care to explain this to Ling Chen because he saw great potential in the first player to leave Novice Village. And Ling Chen also faithfully memorized what the Chief told him before asking: “Chief, have you ever heard of an item called Lunar Scourge?”</p>
<p>“Lunar Scourge?” replied the confused Chief, but after thinking for while, he stated: “I guess I still do not know enough about this world. This is the first time I have ever heard of this item. Young one, where did you learn of such a thing?”</p>
<p>Although this Chief lived in the Novice Village, it was clear that he very knowledgeable. He had travel across this world and knew of many things that normal people would never know of. So if he had heard of the Lunar Scourge then it only means that this item has indeed been forgotten. After all, ten thousand years has passed and many generations have came and went, it was definitely enough time to forget a lot of things. Ling Chen shook his head as he said: “I was just randomly asking. Thank you Chief, for telling me so much. I do not have anymore questions, please send me to the Forgotten Continent.”</p>
<p>The Chief smiled while nodding his head: “Then let me send you now. I believe that as the first player to leave Noive Village, you will become a great figure in the Forgotten Continent. So please work hard young one….and please stand still.”</p>
<p>As the Chief finished speaking, he raised his hands, and a circle of white light dropped from the sky and floated above Ling Chen’s head.</p>
<p>At this time, in the northeast corner of Novice village, the tattered door of the broken house that the Chief advised not to go near opened, and the smelly old man in torn clothes walked out. Suddenly he felt a shock and turned his head, placing a pair of cloudy eyes onto Ling Chen…. and onto Lunar Scourge that hanged on his wrist.</p>
<p>His whole body began to trembl and he started to yell as he ran as fast as he could towards Ling Chen. The surrounding players all were all surprised as they hurried to dodge him.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The strange old man in the novice village n° 49554, with a slap dealing 90000 damage created a big sensation among all players. From that moment, no players dared to come near the little hut and stayed away from the old man. At the time he went crazy, every player fled for their lives. The chief who was preparing to transfer and Ling Chen in front of him also heard the strange roar of the crazy old man, simultaneously looking towards him… discovering that this crazy old man was actually charging towards them.</p>
<p>“Sigh, acting crazy again? I don’t know about the origin of this crazy old man, he stayed here longer than me, did something agitate him. Oh… He looks like he is coming towards you. I will send you away quickly, he’s extremely scary when he goes crazy.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Finishing speaking the chief hurriedly quickened the casting, Ling Chen’s body is covered by a white light and disappeared from the place.</p>
<p>PooF…</p>
<p>The crazy old man threw himself fiercely to the place where Ling Chen was, he stared blankly at the empty ground in front of him, a few seconds later, he roared desperately like a monster, slapping his hands frantically on the ground, every time his hands touch the ground, a thunder like noise resounded, digging on the hard ground a pit of a few meters deep.</p>
<p>All the players faraway, looked with terror at the crazy NPC. The chief is also confused at the sudden change, he escaped quickly. In his memories, the old man is usually calm, as long people don’t provoke him, he won’t provoke them, he acted crazy from times to times, but he was never this hysterical.</p>
<p>“Ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!”</p>
<p>The old man cries became increasingly mad, his roaring voice shook the village and caused aching to the eardrums. His body rolled on the ground, struggling, flapping as if he was in great pain. At the same time… following the rolling of his body, an orb the size of a ping pong ball emitting a faint white light fell from his body, slowly rolling to the side.</p>
<p>The players eyes immediately focused on that orb.</p>
<p>The old man stop rolling, he howled loudly, leaping like a wolf towards the rolling orb, keeping it tightly in his body, he protected it as if it was more important than his life…</p>
<p>“Ding… you have arrived at Azure Dragon City”</p>
<p>“Ding… You are the first player to exit the novice village, you have earned the rewards of +200 fame, +200 Skills points, the event has been recorded in the World Hall Of Fame, the system will inform all players from the world, do you want to hide your personal information?”</p>
<p>When the transporting light disappeared, in front of Ling Chen is a different space,his first feeling is the air is different, he looked up and a sound resounded near his ear, the usual crisp tone of the system.</p>
<p>“No need!” Ling Chen answer directly without thinking. The first one outside the novice village, sure enough there is a world announcement.</p>
<p>At the end of his reponses, a deafening announcement resounded throughout the world.</p>
<p>“Ding… Worldwide announcement. The first player of “Mystic Moon” to leave the novice village has already emerged, the China region player “Ling Tian”. This event has been recorded in the World Hall of Fame, Ling Tian has received +200 fame, +200 SP and a badge as rewards. We hope for the players to keep working hard, to go outside of the novice village, into the New World.”</p>
<p>WoW….</p>
<p>After the end of the announcement, there was a brief silence, then a huge uproar broke out.</p>
<p>Only 5 days has passed from the opening of “Mystic Moon”, at the best the beginning of the 5th day… and right now, someone has already reached level 10 and left the novice village. He only needs less than 5 days to reach level 10.</p>
<p>Surprise, jealousy, disbelief ……</p>
<p>All the players in the Chinese server are in shock, they can’t stop their heart pounding from excitement and pride. Although China has the highest numbers of players, in the history of Virtual Reality games to today,the first one to leave the novice village, there aren’t any Chinese. In other words, today is the first time a in the virtual game world, becoming the first one to receive this honor in China, this is also a brutal slap to the other countries’ players that constantly use this matter to laugh at China.</p>
<p>A burst of cheers and praise erupted all around China, after the first announcement the media began to spread the news to every corner of China. From this moment the Chinese players all remembered the name of ‘Ling Tian’. He brought surprise to the Chinese server to be the first one to kill a Celestial, but this time it is not only surprise, it’s a historic moment and a big glory!</p>
<p>From this moment, the players in China server there is no one who doesn’t know the name “Ling Tian”.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are many players that stood completely dumfounded. Especially those who stand on the top of the level ranking, everyone was increasing their level, they were confident in leaving the novice village first. However, looking at their current level, they couldn’t believe someone had already reached level 10.</p>
<p>Ling Tian… The first person in the world to get a Celestial item.</p>
<p>To reach level 10 so quickly, he must relied on the Celestial item! The attribute of a Celestial equipment must be extremely powerful, his grinding speed is obviously more efficient than the others… This is the only reason of how he can level up so fast!</p>
<p>Ling Chen knows the announcement caused a large uproar in the world, he is just too lazy to care about it, he turns his eyes away, look around the place where he landed. A few meters not far from him, he sees a stone surrounded by light, the stone must be the resurrection place. The resurrection stone is where you can design the resurrection point, after death people can be transported directly here. He is standing in a huge square, extremely vast, however there are only a small number of NPCs moving about. The feeling the NPCs here gave him was completely different from those few at the Novice Village, their dress up was like people from two worlds. Far away, he can see various types of orderly and beautiful buildings, Ling Chen almost has the feeling of living in a modern city.</p>
<p>First things first, he needed to change classes. Ling Chen looked around for a little, selecting a NPC and walking towards him, asking him where he can change class. Suddenly, “Lunar Scourge” flickered a black light, the figure of a voluptuous woman appeared before him, he was forced to stop.</p>
<p>Qi Yue.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say before that without my command you cannot randomly come out?” Ling Chen said helplessly. He knows it clearly, though this witch called him “little master”, she wouldn’t listen to his words.</p>
<p>But this time Ling Chen is surprised, the usual bewitching smile that can make people go crazy didn’t appear on her face, she looks sluggish, after a pause letting out a whisper: “It’s strange… In my dream I seemed to have sensed a Saint Orb…or am I mistaken?”</p>
<p>“A Saint orb?” Hearing the light whisper from Ling Chen, her eyelids jumps slightly.</p>
<p>Qi Yue didn’t speak, she stayed silent for a moment, she was trying hard to search for something, but gave up, her beautiful face turned towards Ling Chen, with her bewitching smile: “ There is nothing, young master, I was in deep sleep, and dreaming, after all I really want to find the Saint orb, that’s all …”</p>
<p>“Forgotten Continent”, Ling Chen holding back his excitement, replied faintly.</p>
<p>“Oh~~” Qi Yue eyes are slightly brightened, she twisted her feminine waist, looking at every direction: “What a beautiful place, those building are really pretty…10000 years, the Forgotten Continent is still Forgotten Continent, but it is not that Forgotten Continent in my memories. Looks like I need to refamiliarize myself with this place…. Little master, take me around this place, okay?”</p>
<p>“Go back inside Lunar Scourge immediately!!, Ling Chen grinded his teeth, giving the order without hesitation. If he takes this witch walking around in Azure Dragon City, think about it, wherever they went, they will draw gazes of men and even woman, if those males NPCs lose control under Qi Yue’’s charm, the consequence will be unthinkable. To go shopping around with Qi Yue… that is absolutely unacceptable!</p>
<p>Her curved lips outlined a wronged expression, even the heart of a stone cold person would melt with just a glance. Qi Yue plaintively said in grievance: “Okay, I’ll just obediently listen to little masters words, I’ll return to that dark place now… But, this place is Forgotten continent, it is no longer the outer islands, so I need to first help little master hide Lunar Scourge’s appearance and aura.”</p>
<p>Qi Yue gently moved her feet, walking in front of Ling Chen, extending a slender, soft snow-white hand and waving over Ling Chen’s left wrist. Immediately, the faint black light released by Lunar Scourge completely disappeared, even it’s appearance quickly blurred in his vision, changing. Soon it actually turned into the shape of a regular black bracelet.</p>
<p>“Okay, like this there should no problems.” Looking at Lunar Scourge’s appearance in satisfaction, Qi Yue gave a tiny smile.</p>
<p>Ling Chen was slightly surprised… This witch, she can actually change Lunar Scourge’s outer appearance! Only… is this change a real change, or just a visual cover up?</p>
<p>“Like this, you’re certain it won’t be discovered?” Ling Chen said.</p>
<p>“The lifespan of the Moon God clan’s 3 goddesses is extremely long, for them 10000 years is just a short flash. But the oracles are different. Their lifespan is at the longest just a couple thousand years. So amongst the Moon God clan the only one’s that have actually seen Lunar Scourge are only the 3 goddesses. They are superior beings that do not live in this worldly world, how could they step foot on Forgotten continent this small place, they especially won’t pay attention to a little otherworld human. So this kind of simple disguise is already enough. As for its aura, it should be even less of a problem. Even if the 3 goddesses come themselves, if they don’t purposely inspect it then it will not be discovered… But they are the 3 great goddesses, how could they go and pay attention to the ‘low grade luna chain’ of a little human like you.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“This kind of method of concealment isn’t perfect either. If little master uses the power of Lunar Scourge its original form will appear, and if it receives an overly powerful attack the illusion will also disappear. Although little master can relax, Lunar Scourge is not so easily detected by the Moon God clan because right now they don’t even know that Lunar Scourge still exists in this world. Moreover a hundred thousand years have already passed, maybe they’ve even forgotten about this evil item that they personally ‘destroyed’. After all, something that no longer ‘exists’ does not need to be remembered. Hee…”</p>
<p>Qi Yue started to smile, a hint of hard to detect darkness flitted across her smiling face that was like a beautiful flower. But it did not escape from Ling Chen’s eyes…</p>
<p>This witch, seems to have some kind of massive grudge with the Moon God clan. Is it because the Moon God clan wants to destroy Lunar Scourge?</p>
<p>“What do I have to do to find the rest of the exclusive orbs?” Ling Chen asked. The primary reason that Ling Chen desires to find the rest of the exclusive orbs is not for Lunar Scourge, but because the powerfulness of the Gemini Orb filled him with incredibly strong curiosity and desire towards the rest of the orbs. After all, with the powerfulness of the Gemini Orb the other orbs are definitely of the same level of strength, and the Saint Orbs will be even stronger beyond imagination. The great temptation that they carried was something that nobody would be able to resist… including Ling Chen.</p>
<p>“Very simple…” Qi Yue’s response made Ling Chen dazed for a moment, but then her following words made his face almost turn black: “Travel across every corner of Forgotten continent, including the surrounding waters. Lunar Scourge’s exclusive orbs will not leave Forgotten continent. If you search every place on Forgotten continent, of course you’ll be able to find them all.”</p>
<p>“You… That’s just rubbish!!” Ling Chen said while biting his teeth.</p>
<p>“But besides this, I don’t have any other ideas either.” Qi Yue pursed her lips smiling, seemingly very satisfied towards that expression filled with black lines on Ling Chen’s face: “Although, if you get particularly close to a God Orb or a Saint Orb, I might be able to sense it. But don’t have too much hope little master, a condition for me to sense the existence of an exclusive orb is that its power needs to be in an active state, in the middle of actively or passively releasing its power. Or else unless you get within a 10 meter radius of it, I will still not be able to sense it, little master, work hard. My future is entirely on you. Right now Lunar Scourge’s power is incomplete, so I have to stay in that dark place for long periods of time. The amount of time I can come out like this everyday is only 10 minutes, if you can find all of the orbs I’ll be be able to completely leave Lunar Scourge. At that time I will forever be little masters little servant, serving little master day and night, whatever little master wants to do to me is okay.”</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s voice stimulated Ling Chen’s mind like a series of electrical currents, making his entire body feel numb and forcibly igniting his flames of desire, the more it burned the stronger it became. Only until now did he understand why this witch constantly remained in Lunar Scourge… Turns out that she can only manifest outside of Lunar Scourge for 10 minutes a day. And it seems like she is sleeping most of the time in Lunar Scourge…</p>
<p>“If it’s like this then hurry up and return to Lunar Scourge!” Ling Chen said while holding his breath, avoiding her eyes that were like water and her enchantingly mesmerizing face… Thank god, thank god she can only stay outside for a max of 10 minutes a day. If she is constantly in front of me, then I really… will have a time where I won’t be able to resist.</p>
<p>The witch that can shorten people’s lives finally returned to Lunar Scourge. Ling Chen took a couples of breaths to calm down his heart before running forwards while taking in his surroundings. After only going the distance of a couple steps, another system notification sounded throughout every corner of the world.</p>
<p>“Ding… World announcement. The second person to leave the Novice Village has emerged, it is America Warzone player ‘Eve’. This event has been recorded into the World Hall of Fame, player ‘Eve’ has gained 100 Fame and 100 SP reward. Hope that all the players may continue to work hard and leave the Novice Village earlier, stepping into a new beginning.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s footsteps immediately stopped.</p>
<p>“Eve”…” He said this name under his breath, his eyes flashing and then continuing to move his feet walking forward.</p>
<p>The most important reason that he was able to reach LV10 so quickly and leave the Novice Village is that he killed a LV10 Faerie beast, making him jump 4 levels and reaching a level height that other players were unable to match from an unremarkable level, also pulling apart a long distance from those top players. If he did not encounter the Greedy Giant Toad and instead farmed regularly, with the amount of time he spends online it would take a lot more days to reach LV10.</p>
<p>And right now, it’s not even 3 minutes from when he left the Novice Village. You can pretty much say that him and Eve both left the Novice Village at the same time, a difference of 3 minutes really can’t be considered a difference — Ling Chen encountered a very fortuitous experience to lead far ahead of the rest of the players, and this Eve…</p>
<p>“Even though I don’t want to meet you again, but between us… there will still be a battle in the end. Or maybe, you’ve already guessed that ‘Ling Tian’ is me.” Ling Chen lightly muttered to himself.</p>
<p>This notification sound brought to Ling Chen a brief moment of sentiment, but what it brought to the world’s players instead was deep shock. Because they suddenly realised that… there is actually someone that moved ahead of “Eve”!!</p>
<p>This is something that no one could do ever since “Eve” appeared in the virtual game world.</p>
<p>A god-like existence among players, the only SSS rank player recognized in the word. A never before defeated or surpassed woman.</p>
<p>This Ling Tian… a never before heard of name, who exactly is he! Him being able to lead ahead of Eve, is it simply a moment of chance and luck, or does he truly possess that kind of strength…</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>Finding an NPC and asking where the class change location is, Ling Chen headed forward. The class change hall is not too far away from the center of the plaza, along the way you need to pass by Azure Dragon City’s biggest commercial street. Ling Chen did not continue moving forward, instead first strolling around the commercial street for some time.</p>
<p>“Boss Cang, I’d like to expand my bag.” Ling Chen said to that storehouse boss that looked even more like a pig than a pig when he walked into the central storehouse of Azure Dragon City.</p>
<p>With business coming a smile immediately spread across the storehouse boss’s face, his two already overly small eyes almost being buried by the fat on his face: “Oh… Could it be that you are a hero from an alternate world that we’ve heard about? Expansion to 100 spaces is 100 gold, expansion to 150 spaces is 300 gold, expansion to 200 spaces is 1000 gold.”</p>
<p>The space in a player’s initial inventory is 50 spaces, this is about just enough to use at the novice stage, but once you reach the capital city it is entirely not enough. But for players at the current stage this expansion fee is undoubtedly an astronomical number, although right now Ling Chen has a massive sum of 1798 gold. He did not hesitate, directly handing over 1000 gold.</p>
<p>Getting the 1000 gold coins, the storehouse boss’s two little eyes instantly lit up like lightbulbs. He hurriedly put away the gold coins, his mouth repeatedly muttering: “Holy crap, rich guy, wealthy, rich kid…”</p>
<p>A beam of light flickered across Ling Chen body, soon after Ling Chen gained the notification that his inventory had already been expanded to 200 spaces. The storehouse boss said smilingly: “All right, hero from another world, your inventory space has already been successfully expanded to the current space limit, come find me again when you reach LV50. At that time you’ll only need 3000 gold coins to expand to 300 spaces. Usually if you have any important items you can deposit them here, 20% discount and no extra fees, dear~~”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “！@#￥%…”</p>
<p>Azure Dragon City’s weapon shop is also filled with White equipment, even an Iron equipment cannot be found. In the item shop is displayed a bunch of items that cannot be bought at the Novice Village, like higher grade potions and energy crystals.</p>
<p>[Green Potion]: Intermediate HP recovery potion, after use instantly recovers 800 HP, Cooldown Time: 5 secs, Price, 2 silver.</p>
<p>[Cyan Potion]: Advanced HP recovery potion, after use instantly recovers 1500 HP, Cooldown Time: 5 secs, Price, 5 silver.</p>
<p>[Deep Blue Potion]: Intermediate MP recovery potion, after use instantly recovers 200 MP, Cooldown Time: 5 secs, Price, 1 silver.</p>
<p>[Purple Potion]: Advanced MP recovery potion, after use instantly recovers 400 MP, Cooldown Time: 5 secs, Price, 5 silver.</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>[Elementary Strength Crystal]: Type: Energy Crystal: Grade: Elementary, Attribute: Fire, Effect: Physical Attack Strength+6%. Price: 200 gold.</p>
<p>[Elementary Magic Crystal]: Type: Energy Crystal: Grade: Elementary, Attribute: Water, Effect: Magic Attack Strength+6%. Price: 200 gold.</p>
<p>[Elementary Health Crystal]: Type: Energy Crystal: Grade: Elementary, Attribute: Water, Effect: HP+6%. Price: 200 gold.</p>
<p>[Elementary Dodge Crystal]: …</p>
<p>[Elementary Hit Crystal]: ..</p>
<p>[Elementary Speed Crystal]: …</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>The effect of elementary crystals is double of beginner crystals, but the price is 10 times of beginner crystals. And the highest grade crystals sold here are elementary, there is not even a shadow of intermediate energy crystals.</p>
<p>“Cough cough, hello young hero, if you have a luna chain the crystals can endow you with additional strength. The stronger your luna chain, the greater the help that they can give you. If one day you surpass LV50, you will be able to head to Forgotten City at the heart of the continent. There you can buy higher grade energy crystals. Of course, when killing monsters there is also a certain probability of higher grade crystals appearing.” The middle aged item store boss said kindly.</p>
<p>An increase of 6% to an attribute is a relatively strong increase in strength, moreover his Lunar Scourge has a whole 12 sockets, of them 9 can be socketed with crystals and orbs of any grade. If he buys 9 different energy crystals and sockets them, his strength will increase greatly. Ling Chen looked at the 800 gold coins that remained after expanding his inventory, hesitating for a while, in the end he did not buy a single one. Walking out of the item store he headed straight for Azure Dragon City’s class change hall. In his knowledge, learning skills after changing classes seems to require gold coins to buy skill books from the trainer, and it could be a relatively big expense, there’s a need to first hold onto these gold coins.</p>
<p>Author’s note: [What will the MCs profession be? Why don’t you guys guess… warrior? Guess again…]]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Due to the massive number of players in the China region, Azure Dragon City’s class change hall is also particularly big. And at this time, this massive class change hall is extremely empty, deserted to the point that it’s a little unbearable to look at. A space as big as several soccer/football fields only has that small handful of people… Ling Chen scanned the place with his eyes, in total there are 7 people… Just right the 7 class trainers corresponding to the 7 classes — warrior, shield guard, archer, elementalist, priest, assassin and summoner.</p>
<p>Closest to the hall entrance is the warrior class trainer, his age looks around 40-50 and his appearance does have a bit of a mentor’s look. When Ling Chen walked over he was in the middle of lying crookedly on the chair, in a listless, half-dead state. The corners of his lips… If there were no problems with Ling Chen’s eyes, seemed to be hanging a pile of saliva! His mouth is even quietly muttering: “Sigh, according to my incomplete calculations, those humans from another world need at least two more days to get here, allegedly the chicks from that world are each one more prettier than the other, their bodies are especially… Hehe, at that time how should I use my status to tease with them… Although how can I spend these two boring days…”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…” (The hell!)</p>
<p>“Cough cough, hello teacher.” Ling Chen was unable to help but to speak out and interrupt this middle aged uncle’s fantasizing.</p>
<p>The half-asleep state warrior trainer only discovered that someone was already standing in front of him when Ling Chen spoke. He widened his eyes and then jumped up from the seat like his butt had been pricked by needles, his perverted expression immediately becoming solemn and serious. He used a lightning fast speed to wipe away the saliva at his lips, adjusting his expression and saying with an amiable face: “Hello young man, this is the class change hall for otherworld humans, non-alternate world humans are not suitable to be here… Hm? Wait a sec, isn’t this place restricted so that only alternate world humans can enter… Could it be… Holy shit, you are an alternate world human… also a so called ‘player’!?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” When Ling Chen responded the muscles on his face twitching. Is this a class trainer or an oscar actor, the speed and quality of his expression change is practically over god level. Although, he is a trainer, an expression of disdain can definitely not be shown. Good NPCs cannot be displeased.</p>
<p>A series of ripples appeared in the warrior trainer’s heart… Holy crap! There’s already a player arriving here so quickly! Arriving here two days earlier than we predicted! Those couple of old guys are right, in an alternate world with billions of people, how can there not be some anomalies… aka the so called geniuses! This person should be the first person to arrive here, the first amongst billions of people… If he isn’t a genius then who is! The first person to reach here came to me, he clearly wants to become a warrior! Oh man my little heart, how much face will I have when I tell people. Those old guy’s will probably be so jealous of me.</p>
<p>“Cough cough!” The warrior trainer slowly nodded his head towards Ling Chen, his face very serious: “Hello hero from another world, welcome to Azure Dragon City, may the Moon God bless you. You are the first player to arrive here, being able to arrive here so quickly really made me surprised. Looks like you must be a hero with incredibly high talent. Looking at your attire, right now you should be an apprentice warrior, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ling Chen briefly replied saying. Isn’t this bullshit, if I wasn’t an apprentice warrior why would I come to find you!</p>
<p>“Very good.” The warrior trainer continued to nod his head seriously: “Warriors are the most powerful profession on Forgotten continent, we warriors have the strongest close combat ability and relatively strong defense ability. On the battlefield, we are always the brave ones charging at the very front. Without us warriors, even the largest parties would be lackluster. Being able to be the first one to arrive here proves that you have strong talent and strength. Picking the warrior class also proves that you have good eyesight…</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…” (The fuck…)</p>
<p>“I can help you to become a true warrior. The elementary warrior class does not have any branches, they can freely use sabers, swords, spears, axes, halberds and other weapons of the sort. These weapons can all freely use all of the skills of elementary warriors. But I recommend you to pick one of the weapons to continue developing, because after the second class change of warriors different branches will appear based on the weapon used, so only becoming proficient with one type of weapon is the best choice and can also save large amounts of SP. Then, of the warrior’s weapons, sword/saber type weapons have the most balanced stats, spear/halberd type weapons have a large attack area, their attack strength is high but attack speed is low, axe/mace type weapons have the strongest attack and can also stun when attacking but after the use of a skill a longer opening will be revealed. So you have to think clearly about what weapon to pick. Then, do you want to become a true warrior right now?”</p>
<p>After finishing speaking the warrior trainer stared at Ling Chen with a solemn face, as if afraid that Ling Chen wouldn’t agree he also immediately added a line: “Because you are the first apprentice warrior to come here, after becoming an official warrior all the skills that you learn from me can all be free. I can also help you upgrade the proficiency skill of the weapon you pick to LV2.”</p>
<p>There’s even incentives! This for Ling Chen of course couldn’t be better, he nodded his head saying: “Thank you teacher, please make me a true warrior.”</p>
<p>“Very good.” The warrior trainer nodded his head in satisfaction: “May the Moon God bless you, you are about to become a mighty warrior. Then allow me to first see your trainee skills. If when you have any skills that can reach max level, your corresponding official warrior skill will directly upgrade to LV2. Come, show me your skills.”</p>
<p>When any trainee skill is able to reach max level, the corresponding official warrior skill will directly upgrade to LV2? Ling Chen Chen first paused for a moment and then immediately understood… Right now he has 3 trainee skills. Single target [Full Power Strike], AOE [Crescent Slash], and a buff skill that increases attack strength [Fire of Rage]. In other words, whichever of these 3 skills is able to reach max level, the corresponding single target, aoe and buff skill of the official class will directly reach LV2!</p>
<p>Without hesitating Ling Chen immediately called out his skill page and displayed all of the skills in front of the warrior trainer.</p>
<p>The warrior trainer’s gaze fell upon Ling Chen’s skill page. Just taking a glance his face already revealed an expression of shock: “You actually unlocked Fire of Rage’s skill… This only unlocks after the apprentice warrior’s two basic skills both reach max level, not bad not bad, you truly are a genius… Wait!! You you you you you… Your Fire of Rage is actually already max level too!!”</p>
<p>“All of your trainee skills are actually max level!!” The warrior trainer’s eyes widened, his gaze returned to Ling Chen’s face with a “Fwoosh”, his expression excited and thrilled like seeing a naked beauty: “Genius… Genius!! You alternate world humans have only arrived at this world for not even 5 days… Not even 5 day’s time. Not only have you unlocked Fire of Rage, all of your trainee skill’s actually all reached max level! Young hero… You can be said to be the most amazing genius that I have ever seen. I believe that in the future you will become a great warrior! I… I’ve decided, after you change classes I will use all of my strength to directly upgrade all of your official warrior skills yo LV3. You are a true genius, maybe in the future you will be the pride of Forgotten continent’s warriors! You have the qualifications to gain this kind of honor!!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>After being excited, the warrior trainer returned his gaze back to Ling Chen’s skill page, confirming again that the trainee skills that he saw had all reached max level. When he accidently continued looking downwards, his entire body suddenly shook, his body leaning forward, his eyes nearly popping out.</p>
<p>“H…Heaven Wind Technique… Item Manipulation Technique… Th th th th th this…” The dignified image that the warrior trainer originally held up completely disappeared, swallowing a mouthful of saliva and even starting to stammer while speaking: “Aren’t these… ancient battle techniques that are said to have disappeared 10000 years ago!!!”</p>
<p>The warrior trainer blankly stared at the two ancient battle techniques that only existed in legends and were only known by very few people, unable to believe in his eyes. After the names are effect descriptions, this is not just having the same names, their effects are also the exact same as in the legends! Only after a long time did he return to his senses, shifting his gaze in shock and wanting to ask Ling Chen where he gained these two ancient battle techniques. But when he turned his head, his gaze once again accidently fell upon Ling Chen’s final skill [Soul Sacrifice].</p>
<p>Instantly the entire body of this middle aged uncle trembled as if being stuck by lightning, completely freezing there. The expression on his face was exaggerated to the point that it could not be described, that wide open mouth made Ling Chen believe that shoving in a buck-toothed rabbit wasn’t even a problem.</p>
<p>“That, mister teacher, is there a problem?” The warrior trainer maintained his dumbfounded action for a whole 5 seconds and still did not return to his senses, like he had suddenly been petrified. Ling Chen was forced to speak out, tentatively asking.</p>
<p>Under Ling Chen’s voice the warrior trainer’s entire body shook, only then returning to his senses. His eyes continuously looked at [Soul Sacrifice], verifying again and again that there was not a problem with his eyes, and then abruptly turning around yelling out loud: “You bunch of old dogs… Hurry up and get over here, get over here immediately!!”</p>
<p>The other 6 class trainers who were originally also idling about and half-asleep all had the daylights scared out of them from this thunderous roar, two of them even fell from their chairs.</p>
<p>“Damn you, did you get raped or what!”</p>
<p>“Fuck! Shut up! I was in the middle of dating a pretty chick in my dream, she was scared away by your voice!”</p>
<p>“What the hell are you yelling about! If it’s not something that I’m interested in, I’m going to rip you apart!!”</p>
<p>Six similarly aged older people walked over cursing, that line up and image made Ling Chen not know what to think — Is this exactly a group of class trainers or a group of street thugs.</p>
<p>The warrior trainer did not speak, extending his hand and pointing at [Soul Sacrifice] on Ling Chen’s skill page, the gaze of the six class trainers simultaneously fell upon it.</p>
<p>Immediately, the world fell silent.</p>
<p>Ling Chen looked at the 6 pairs of eyes and mouths that had opened wide in an instant, if their heights were lower their jaws would be able to directly hit the ground.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Um… Is there a problem?” That exaggerated to the extreme expression of theirs made Ling Chen unable but to think of some things. [Soul Sacrifice] this skill is a skill that he unlocked himself after that dire battle against the Greedy Giant Toad. It is an extremely dangerous impasse skill that after use puts the user at edge of death, but its effect can also be said to be incomparably terrifying. At just LV2 it can already instantly increase attack strength by 3 times the original… Those short 15 seconds that are endlessly close to death, will derive the possibility to create a miracle and turn the tides of battle.</p>
<p>This dangerous and scary skill evoked such an exaggerated reaction from these class trainers, is that within this skill it is also hiding something else?</p>
<p>“I say you guys, don’t be so pathetic please!! You’re all freaking acting like you lost your souls! The guy’s an alternate world hero coming here to change classes, this behaviour of you guys is shameful!” Seeing the 6 trainers all become sluggish like they had suddenly died, the warrior trainer immediately let out a series of roars… Completely forgetting that when he saw [Soul Sacrifice] he was also incredibly excited.</p>
<p>The warrior trainer’s voice was unusually loud, making Ling Chen almost unable to resist taking a step back. Although this voice also made the 6 class trainers return to their senses. They did not care about the spit that the warrior trainer had sprayed all over their faces, each of them staring straight at Ling Chen’s face as if looking at a creature that came from space, making Ling Chen’s hair stand on end. Hearing the warrior trainer call him an otherworld hero that came here to change classes, each of those shocked gazes all transformed into a fanaticism that made Ling Chen nervous.</p>
<p>The first one to burst out loud was the shield guard trainer. He took a step forward, his face filled with excitement and longing standing before Ling Chen, that expression was like Big Big Wolf that starved for 800 years suddenly seeing Pleasant Goat: “Kid… Ah no, hero from another world. That you can possess [Soul Sacrifice] this skill proves that you have a very huge spiritual force… With such talent, how can you waste it on warrior this garbage class that could not be more garbage. Come… become a shield guard.!! You who possesses a powerful spiritual force, after becoming a shield guard you will have the strongest guardian faith and guardian will, this is the most needed talent to become the ultimate shield guard! I believe that you who has such talent will definitely become Forgotten continent’s strongest shield guard! That’s right, shield guard is the profession that suits you the most! As long as you change your class to shield guard, I can convert your strength attribute into constitution, and will directly upgrade all of your shield guard class skills all to LV3! Young man, do not hesitate… After becoming a shield guard, you will absolutely not regret your decision.” (TL: Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf, a very popular childrens cartoon, very very popular.)</p>
<p>“Piss off!! Stupid shield guards don’t have any attack ability, that’s simply stifling this genius… No, it’s godly talent!” The shield guard trainer that hadn’t even finished yelling was slapped away, a trainer wearing a green robe charged to Ling Chen’s face, his two eyes shining like lightbulbs: “Young man! You are tall, handsome and stately, very similar to the me in the past. The instant I saw you I knew that you were a natural born archer… Sure enough the reality is exactly like so! You have such powerful spiritual force, you can detect everything in an extremely short amount of time, homing in on the target and never missing an arrow, shooting with great precision… Those warriors, shield guards and whatnot would already have become beehives before they could even get close. Not becoming an archer is practically a waste of God’s gift. There’s nothing to think about, become Forgotten continent’s most powerful profession, the archer! As long as you are willing to become an archer, I can convert all of your strength attribute into agility, and will also directly upgrade all of your archer profession skills all to LV5! That’s right, you did not hear wrong, it’s upgrading all of your skills to LV5! Moving is better than being moved, hurry up and pick up the phone… Uh no, hurry up and become an archer, as long as you say a word…”</p>
<p>“Screw off to the side! Cough cough, young man, you must not listen to their blind sweet-talking, believe me, your most suitable profession is an assassin. With huge spiritual force, assassins can turn into the most terrifying death gods of the darkness, able to maintain the most acute senses in any environment, seeing through everything! At the same time as long as you don’t want, nobody will be able to discover your whereabouts, this is the ultimate level pursued by assassins! With your talent, you’ll definitely be able to become a top-class assassin in a short period of time, at that time killing and robbing, being sneaky, getting chicks and acting cool, will all be ever successful…. Hey hey hey, what’s that expression. Don’t hesitate anymore, let me turn you into an assassin right now, I will also directly upgrade all of you assassin skills all to LV10 for free…”</p>
<p>“All of you shut up!! You guys are harming him, do you understand!! Cough cough, young man, look at my eyes. That’s right, this kindly gaze of mine proves that I am a great priest. What does a powerful priest need the most? That’s right, it’s spiritual force! As long as you have strong spiritual force, you’ll be able to make the most perfect judgements on the battlefield, healing at the most precise moments. With your talent, I believe that healing efficiency can reach the legendary 90%… No, it’s 95% and above!! Believe me, you will become the world’s most powerful priest, becoming world famous. At that time there will be countless players who want to challenge powerful bosses coming to plead for your protection… Become a great priest. As long as you nod your head and agree, I will directly add to you an extra 500 MP, and will also upgrade all of your priest skills all to max level, max level!!”</p>
<p>“Fuck!! Such monstrous talent and you actually want him to go be a healer! I think your head’s been clipped by a door! Ah, young man, don’t listen to them, elementalist is the most correct choice for you. With such powerful spiritual force talent, if you become an elementalist, your chanting speed for magic could even be multiple times faster than other people! Magic that you release will also release an even stronger power. At that time, you will become the most terrifying destruction machine, you’d just need to casually wave your hands, and whatever warriors, shield guards, archers, assassins, priests, you can kill as many as you want… In front of your powerful magic they will all be nothing. Ya, I believe that your decision will definitely be very wise. Come, become a powerful elementalist. I will add an extra 1000 MP to you, and will also directly upgrade all of your elementalist skills all to max level… Oh, and I will also give a full set of LV15 Silver equipment!! Do you still have a reason to hesitate!!”</p>
<p>“Max level… giving additional stats… giving a set of equipment… Are you bunch of old dogs crazy!! Have you guys forgotten the trainer rules and work ethic that we should comply with? You guys are honestly too outrageous! Each of you guys not even wanting face anymore, isn’t it just a person with strong spiritual talent. Young man, don’t mind them! Actually, the profession that you are most suitable for is summoner! Other beginner summoners will reach their spiritual limit after summoning at most 3 summoned beasts, but with your spiritual force maybe you’ll be able to summon 5, or even 8, 10! And you’ll also be able to summon powerful beings that other people wouldn’t be able to summon. At that time, you yourself will be equivalent to the strength of a dozen people, who cares what classes the opponents are you don’t need to put them in your eyes. Cough cough cough cough… Don’t hesitate, please don’t hesitate, believe me, this is your most correct choice!! As long as you choose to become a summoner right now, whatever max level skill and giving a set of Silver equipment is all a piece of cake, I will also give you an unique summoner skill book… Oh right, I also have a daughter, 18 years of age this year, she is a gorgeous beauty and is also a LV50 light summoner, she is still not wed yet…”</p>
<p>“Bullshit! You shameless person, he’s clearly most suited to be a shield guard!!”</p>
<p>“Screw off!! He has to become an archer!!”</p>
<p>“All of you fuck off, he’s most suited to be an elementalist!”</p>
<p>“… Assassin!!”</p>
<p>“Shield Guard!!”</p>
<p>“Summoner!!”</p>
<p>“Priest!!”</p>
<p>“Shield guard!!”</p>
<p>“Assassin!!!”</p>
<p>…………………..</p>
<p>…………………..</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “！@#￥%……”</p>
<p>The six trainers were like vendors at a market working hard to promote their classes to Ling Chen and giving all kinds of incentives, arguing with each other red in the face, just missing actually fighting. And the voices of these 6 guys were each one louder than the other, the vibrations making Ling Chen’s eardrums hum and almost unable to resist turning around and running. Although he also came to understand why these trainers would be so moved… An important condition of unlocking Soul Sacrifice is possessing powerful spiritual force. At the time when Ling Chen fought the Greedy Giant Toad, he lasted for a whole 9 hours under extremely high mental pressure. This is a terrifying mental fortitude that normal people can definitely not possess, and because of it he automatically unlocked [Soul Sacrifice] after defeating the Greedy Giant Toad. These class trainers evidently all know [Soul Sacrifice] this skill and know that a person that possesses [Soul Sacrifice] definitely has extremely high spiritual strength. And for every profession, stats can be increased, equipment can be changed, skills can be learned… but spiritual strength, that is the most important talent that is hard to change. With powerful spiritual strength, regardless if it’s warriors, shield guards, archers, assassins, elementalists, priests and summoners, the strength of the professions can all be brought out to the limit. That is to say no matter what class they change to, they will be able to easily become an apex master of this class.</p>
<p>As a result, these class trainers were all fighting over him, if they continue to argue they might actually start to fight.</p>
<p>The warrior trainer that hadn’t spoken the whole time stood there his face green at one moment and white at another, the muscles of his face were especially twitching like he’d pulled a muscle. Finally, he could no longer bear it, a loud roar releasing from his mouth: “All of you shut up!!!!!!”</p>
<p>Like thunder that came from nowhere, that loud voice shook the entire class change hall making the dust on the ceiling fall down. Ling Chen was directly shocked dizzy, the 6 class trainers all finally all stopped, each of them stretching their necks and staring at him.</p>
<p>“What the fuck are you old fools fighting about!!”</p>
<p>“Fuck!! I’m telling you, even though he came to become a warrior but don’t you think of hogging him…”</p>
<p>“Hogging him my ass, even if he wants to become a warrior right now I won’t let him!!” The warrior trainer roared.</p>
<p>After saying this the other 6 class trainers were all dazed there, even Ling Chen was dazed.</p>
<p>The warrior trainer rubbed his throat that was sore from yelling, turning his face looking towards Ling Chen, saying with a serious face: “Young man, being able to unlock [Soul Sacrifice] says that you have extremely terrifying spiritual force. But, you definitely do know what this skill means, right?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen slightly nodded his head, quietly awaiting his explanation.</p>
<p>The class trainer explained with a severe countenance: “The people that know this skill right now are very few. Besides us there should only be those people who are at the peak of strength or authority that know. Because the last time this skill appeared is 10000 years ago, and after that, there was never again the appearance of this skill. Which is to say, since the death of that person from 10000 years ago, you are the first person whose spiritual force was strong enough to unlock [Soul Sacrifice], at least on Forgotten continent it is like so. That’s why we would be so excited.”</p>
<p>The other 6 class trainers all nodded their heads.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The first person in 10000 years?</p>
<p>Towards this reality, Ling Chen was curious but not shocked.</p>
<p>He knows very clearly how powerful his spiritual strength is. That is a level that unlimitedly surpasses regular beings… His spiritual ability was also tempered through countless times of mental torture for an unknown period of time that humans are unable to bear. How can it be compared to and imagined by regular life forms.</p>
<p>His indifference made the 7 class trainers all quite surprised. In their knowledge, hearing that they are the first person in 10000 years regular people should all be jumping with excitement. The warrior trainer continued saying: “Well, looks like you also know that you possess powerful spiritual ability… No, being able to unlock [Soul Sacrifice] your spiritual ability is more than just strong, it’s practically already monstrous to the point that it’s hard to describe. People that don’t know what [Soul Sacrifice] means is one thing, if this matter is discovered by those of power who know of [Soul Sacrifice], they will behave as excited and shocked as us. Forgotten Continent has hundreds of millions of humans, but in all these years humans that have been able to reach Mysterious God level strength are incredibly few. Just like right now, there are only three people on Forgotten Continent that have the power of Mysterious God. And people that have been able to reach Saint Destroyer, throughout all of history there has never been a single person… Although this number has to exclude the ‘Moon God Clan’ those ‘gods’ that have surpassed the level of ‘human’, along with 10000 years ago that ‘Shura’ that made even the heavens and earth tremble.</p>
<p>Shura… They also know of Shura.</p>
<p>Wait… They said that the last person to unlock [Soul Sacrifice] was 10000 years ago. Could it be, that person is…</p>
<p>“And the last person to unlock [Soul Sacrifice], is humanity’s number 1 master from 10000 years ago, ‘Red Flame Sword King’, who is also the Shura that I just mentioned.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to know what Shura means. Because this name should not appear again in the future, you knowing the origin of this name will only pointlessly increase fear. You only need to know that he was Forgotten Continent’s number 1 human master at the time. He was initially a human, but after become a Shura he was no longer a human, because Shura is a level that surpasses humans… A terrifying being that surpasses even the level of ‘gods’ and ‘devils’. This kind of being is not tolerated by the world, once he appears he will suffer heaven’s wrath. His result is also complete annihilation, disappearing without even leaving an ash. And he, is 10000 years ago that person who unlocked [Soul Sacrifice]. Me telling you this stuff is to let you know that the reason humans are unable to reach Saint Destroyer, and even have an incredibly hard time reaching Mysterious God, is not because the lifespan of humans is too short and are unable to climb to the top, but because the limit of the spiritual strength that humans possess makes humans unable to break through to the limit that their spirits can bear. The bodies and intrinsic of the Moon God clan are exactly the same as humans, but the reason they they are ‘gods’ is simply because they have one thing different from humans. That is that they are gifted with massive spiritual force! Under massive spiritual force, the speed that their strength increases and the limits that they can reach cannot be matched by humans. And you… that you can unlock [Soul Sacrifice] proves that you are like Red Flame Sword King, a terrifying anomaly amongst humans. The limit that you can reach will surpass the area of normal humans. In other words, if you are willing to work hard, one day you might be able to reach a height that surpasses Mysterious God!!”</p>
<p>The other class trainers all followed nodding their heads. This is also why they were so worked up wanting Ling Chen to change to the class that they possess, even not hesitating to go against the rules, using any means possible. Everything was like how the warrior trainer said, if he works hard enough and then has enough good luck, he might be able to become the first person to reach Saint Destroyer besides Red Flame Sword King that descended into the “Shura’s path”! Just thinking that this kind of person is the class that they belong to and that it was also them that personally changed his class, this is undoubtedly an unbelievable honour.</p>
<p>“Wait a sec, old man warrior, you saying all this crap, are you thinking…”</p>
<p>The warrior trainer’s eyes flashed, gradually saying: “You old fools were only busy fighting over this genius, have you guys forgotten… a person possessing such terrifying talent yet changing into a regular class, isn’t that too much injustice towards his talent!”</p>
<p>The other 6 class trainers were all instantly silent, and then all revealing an ashamed expression: “Okay, you’re right, we were too worked up, it’s virtually a waste if he changes to a regular class.”</p>
<p>The warrior trainer nodded his head, his eyes staring straight at Ling Chen whose expression was a bit stunned, saying: “After a bit, come with me to a place… a place call The Hall of Heroic Spirits.”</p>
<p>“Like I thought, there is indeed no one else that is more qualified than him to enter The Hall of Heroic Souls.” The shield guard trainer followed saying.</p>
<p>Hall of Heroic Souls? Newly arriving at Azure Dragon City Ling Chen naturally would not know what kind of place this is. But, from the conversation of these class trainers he understood… These 7 class trainers no longer planned to change his class to one of the 7 main professions. Instead they want him to change to a — Hidden profession!!</p>
<p>Hidden professions, these are touched upon in every virtual game world, at the same time it is also what all players dream of. The reason the hidden professions are called hidden, is because this type of class is listed outside of the 7 main classes. Nobody knows where these classes are or how to change to them. Hidden classes are not necessarily stronger than regular classes, but they all have their own special features and are all very rare. To change to a hidden profession requires enough luck and opportunity, of course you also need powerful strength. Usually hidden professions are all gained through some hidden quests of hell-like difficulty. Those few hidden classes hidden within the virtual game world are practically the dreams of all players that they desperately search for… But in previous virtual game worlds, there are only those handful of people out of China’s hundreds of millions of players that could change to a hidden profession. And these people are either the Heaven Ranking and Earth Ranking experts with powerful strength, or big shots in powerful guilds with vast resources.</p>
<p>And right now, these class trainers clearly want to change his profession to a hidden profession different from the 7 main regular classes!</p>
<p>Saying that he wasn’t excited would be a lie… In previous virtual game worlds, Ling Chen also tried to search for those legendary hidden classes but always ended up empty-handed. If hidden classes were so easy to find how could they deserve to be called hidden classes. The value of hidden professions is not just because of their huge potential, but even more because they are incredibly rare.</p>
<p>“What kind of place is The Hall of Heroic Souls?” Ling Chen asked.</p>
<p>“1900 years ago, a peerless master appeared on Forgotten Continent, he is the human whose strength has been recognized to be the closest to Saint Destroyer in human history (PS: Shura is automatically excluded out of humans). He was called ‘War God’ by the people at that time, he was obsessed with martial arts and loved to fight, he travelled throughout the entire world never meeting a worthy opponent. Even right now, as long as they are a martial artist nobody does not know the name of ‘War God’. And after him there has also been not been another person qualified to be crowned with the name ‘War God’. But even if he is War God, he also has the time where his lifespan ends. 1000 years ago, his life was about to end, but he was unwilling for his power to disappear with his body. And so he built “The Hall of Heroic Souls’ in his hometown Azure Dragon City and left his power within it. If someone is able to pass the trials that he left behind, that person will be able to obtain the recognition of the power that he left behind, thus obtaining the inheritance of ‘War God’. After ‘War God’’s death, the name of “The Hall of Heroic Spirits’ also travelled across the world. From then on,, many peerless masters followed ‘War God’’s steps when their lives were about to end, leaving their last remnants of power within The Hall of Heroic Spirits. Whoever is able to pass their trials will be able to obtain the inheritance of the respective power, thereby changing to the respective powerful profession.”</p>
<p>The assassin trainer picked up from the warrior trainer saying: “The Hall of Heroic Souls can be said to be Azure Dragon City’s most sacred place. There is not a single martial artist on Forgotten Continent that does not know its name. Every year there are an innumerable number of martial artists wanting to enter The Hall of Heroic Souls longing to attain the inheritance of the masters’ power. But, The Hall of Heroic Souls is not a place that you can enter just because you want to. To enter The Hall of Heroic Souls you need to satisfy at least 3 conditions — One, you must not have a sinful heart, this is a must: Two, your level has to be lower than LV15. Because if your level is too high and the strength of your own class matures, even if you are recognized after adding the new profession its strength will be weakened due to the rejection of the initial class: Number three, you need to have high enough talent, or else even if you entered it would be a pure waste of time. In addition, according to the rules of The Hall of Heroic Spirits, one person only has one chance in their lifetime to accept The Hall of Heroic Spirits’ trials. After one chance, regardless if you succeed or not you will not be allowed to enter again. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded his head.</p>
<p>Listening to these trainers, within that “Hall of Heroic Spirits” there are many inheritances of strength left behind by peerless masters of their time. In other words, inside there are many powers that can help people to change to a hidden profession… That is to say, there are many hidden professions within!!</p>
<p>If this place is discovered by other players, they’ll all charge over like crazy.</p>
<p>Seemingly seeing through Ling Chen’s thoughts, the warrior trainer said: “The Hall of Heroic Spirits is a sacred place, it is absolutely not a place that a person can enter because they want to. It’s not that you otherworld humans have not been given the qualification to enter, it’s just that the only way to enter is to have extremely high talent and be chosen by us, thereby being brought into the Hall of Heroic Souls. Allegedly, there will be a couple hundred million of you guys entering Forgotten Continent, but I believe that those that will have the qualifications to enter will not surpass 1 in 50 million. In other words, even if you guys all arrive, people that will have the qualifications to be recognized by us and enter within will not surpass 10 people. You need to know, the power level of Forgotten Continent’s humans greatly surpasses you players. But in the 1000 years after the Hall of Heroic Souls was established, there have only been a total of 9 people that have obtained one of the inheritances within. In other words it averages every 100 years for just one person to succeed, and these 9 people later all became masters whose names shook the world.”</p>
<p>“Explaining this much you should also understand now. Right now let me take you to the Hall of Heroic Souls. Not speaking of [Soul Sacrifice], being the first to arrive here amongst hundreds of millions of players, with just this one point you have the qualifications to enter the Hall of Heroic Souls, follow me.”</p>
<p>Finishing speaking, the warrior trainer did not delay anymore, beckoning towards Ling Chen and then moving his feet walking towards the direction of the hall entrance. Theoretically there will not be players coming to change class in these two days, so he didn’t need to worry about the problem of “leaving his post”.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Hey! What are you bunch of old dogs following for!” Taking only two steps the warrior trainer discovered that behind him wasn’t just Ling Chen following, but also the other 6 class trainers.</p>
<p>“Of course we’re going to see together! Who said that only you can go. Besides right now it’s impossible for any other players to come here, leaving isn’t a problem.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>In the end, it was the 7 class trainers together bringing Ling Chen heading straight for the Hall of Heroic Spirits. Ling Chen is probably the only person amongst players that can gain such an honour. After all the 7 class trainers all developed relatively big interest towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>The Hall of Heroic Spirits is located at a quiet area, not too far away from the Lord’s hall. Just getting close Ling Chen felt an unspeakable aura of heaviness and austerity. When getting near to here, the class trainers that were all joking around on the way here all zipped their lips, their faces all exposing a serious and solemn expression. When standing in front of the Hall of Heroic Souls. their expressions became even more serious, even being mixed with slight nervousness.</p>
<p>Compared to Azure Dragon City’s many buildings that could be called extravagant, the Hall of Heroic Spirits is old and unremarkable, it’s size is also a lot smaller than Ling Chen had predicted. Looking over, the figures of other people cannot be seen around here, the atmosphere is also a bit overly deserted and silent. The class trainers said that this is Azure Dragon City’s most sacred place and that regular people are not allowed to get close, looks like it is indeed so.</p>
<p>“This is the place.” Outside the hall entrance, the warrior trainer stopped his footsteps and said quietly towards Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Just finishing speaking, the tightly closed hall doors suddenly slightly opened. A man clothed entirely in black, his gaze like an eagle’s slowly walked out, coldly saying: “What are you guys doing here.”</p>
<p>When he talked, without needing to purposely make any movements, a pressing aura blew over. This aura also told Ling Chen that this person should be the Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian, a person whose strength is powerful to the point that it is terrifying… And how could the strength of a person who is qualified to guard Azure Dragon City’s most sacred place not be strong.</p>
<p>“He is the first otherworld human to arrive at Azure Dragon City, he has the qualifications to enter the Hall of Heroic Souls. You can test his qualifications right now.” The warrior trainer shifted aside his body, pointing at Ling Chen while speaking to him.</p>
<p>“No need, since you guys brought him, you, come in.” The black-clothed middle aged person was unexpectedly straightforward, using his eyes to stare straight at Ling Chen for a moment.</p>
<p>Towards his straightforwardness, the 7 main class trainers did not feel surprised. Because they have been given spaces to suggest at most 10 players to enter the Hall of Heroic Souls. Being able to be selected by them, the testing of talent is basically unnecessary.</p>
<p>“Go ahead… Inside there are many powerful forces left behind by previous masters, with your spiritual ability, it is enough for you to gain the recognition of any power. And then you’ll be able to obtain the inheritance for the respective power, changing into an even more powerful class… But remember, you absolutely must not pick that one in the very middle…”</p>
<p>“Enter now.” The black clothed middle aged person said with a frown, seemingly rather discontent towards their dawdling.</p>
<p>Ling Chen glanced at the warrior trainer in uncertainty, randomly nodding his head and walking up the stairs. Standing at the entrance of the Hall of Heroic Souls, he directly stepped inside after slightly pausing outside.</p>
<p>“Only he alone can go in, you guys are not allowed to enter.” His cold gaze sweeping across the 7 class trainers, the black clothed middle aged person expressionlessly left behind this sentence, and then turned around walking into the Hall of Heroic Souls. Following, in a heavy sound the entrance door for the Hall of Heroic Souls tightly closed.</p>
<p>“What should we do?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean what do we do? Wait here of course! Didn’t we follow over to see exactly whose inheritance that youngster can obtain. Do you want to go back?”</p>
<p>“To hell with going back! There won’t be anyone else coming to change classes in the next two days, you think everyone is as monstrous that that guy just now.”</p>
<p>“What kind of power inheritance do you guys feel that he’ll pick?”</p>
<p>“Does that even need to be said, of course it’ll be a warrior type!”</p>
<p>“Bullshit! Such high spiritual talent, it should evidently be an archer type!”</p>
<p>“Fuck off! He’ll definitely pick an elementalist type!”</p>
<p>“What the hell are you guys arguing about! Whether or not he can obtain a power inheritance is still unknown.”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to worry about this. With his spiritual strength that can unlock [Soul Sacrifice], meeting him the powers those past masters left behind will definitely approach him on their own, they’ll probably even beg him to inherit them.”</p>
<p>“But, what if he isn’t thinking straight and chooses that one in the middle?”</p>
<p>Once this line was said, all of the class trainers immediately became silent.</p>
<p>“Cough cough, there’s no need to worry about this. Just now I specially warned him telling him not to touch the one in the very middle, he should have an idea in his heart.” The warrior trainer said with a face of assurance.</p>
<p>“That’s good.” The other class trainers all immediately breathed a sigh of relief. In their knowledge, with Ling Chen’s terrifying spiritual ability, obtaining the recognition of those powerful forces should virtually be as easy as pie. When the time comes it probably won’t be Ling Chen going to search for powers that will approve of him, but instead those powers scrambling to compete for his approval, only that one in the middle… That is the strongest power, but also the power that is impossible for Ling Chen to obtain approval of. Because that power is not just a test of spirit, there are also trials of strength. That test of strength is very difficult… or it can be said to be cruel to the extreme. Since the appearance of the Hall of Heroic Souls, there has not been a single person that could pass. Before when they saw Ling Chen’s skill page, they also saw Ling Chen’s stats. With his current level and strength, it is simply impossible for him to pass that strength trial… not a single sliver of chance.</p>
<p>Inside the Hall of Heroic Souls.</p>
<p>The moment the entrance door closed, the overly silent atmosphere made Ling Chen practically have a feeling of walking into the Hall of Yanwang. Looking across, the Hall of Heroic Spirits is very big, but it is also overly spacious. Right now besides him and the expressionless black clothed middle aged person beside him, there are no other living things inside this hall that is as big as half a soccer field. The ground is a cold marble floor, the walls have no grains, on top is also a plain, unadorned flat ceiling… The only thing in the entire hall that can make people look at it, is that row of dim pillars in front. (TL: Yanwang, Chinese god of death so to speak, but think of him more as a judge.)</p>
<p>Is it that the powers left behind by those past masters that they mentioned, are in those pillars. This hall doesn’t seem to have any other things.</p>
<p>“Stand in front, and then let them automatically sense your strength. If your talent can gain any power’s approval, the respective pillar will glow. If not, that says that your talent is not enough to gain the approval of any of the powers, you can only head back. Go up… Although, don’t have too much hope. The origins of these powers are all at the very least Heaven End level masters. Being approved by them is definitely not something that average talent can achieve. There are countless people on Forgotten Continent with high talent, but in 1000 years there have only been 15 people that could gain the approval of these powers!”</p>
<p>Finishing speaking, the black clothed middle aged person stopped talking, a pair of dead fish eyes indifferently staring at his movements.</p>
<p>15 people? Didn’t those class trainers say there were only a total of 9 people? Ling Chen was slightly confused for a moment but did not say anything, moving his feet and walking forward, walking to the front of the pillars… Scanning across, there are a total of 11 pillars here, hidden within are inevitably the powers left behind by 11 of Forgotten Continent’s peerless masters before they died. The thickness of these pillars are all essentially the same… Only that pillar in the very middle, it’s thickness is at least triple of the rest of the pillars. Standing proudly in the middle like the bright moon encircled by stars.</p>
<p>He remembers that before entering, the warrior trainer told him that he must not pick the pillar in the very middle, is he talking about this one…</p>
<p>“Stand on that white tile.” A cold voice came from behind him.</p>
<p>Not too far in front of Ling Chen, there is a one meter square tile presenting a dazzling pure white color. Ling Chen walked over, standing on top of it. Immediately, he felt multiple auras travel over from different directions, all locking onto his body.</p>
<p>This kind of feeling… are the 11 powers testing me…</p>
<p>“Relax your mind, when standing on top of this tile, these powers left behind by masters will all go to inspect your talent. If your talent is enough to gain approval, then the respective pillar will light up and you will be able to obtain that power’s inheritance.”</p>
<p>The black clothed middle aged person had just finished talking when a sudden “Zheng” sound travelled to his ears. The pillar at the very left suddenly released a light red glow. Ling Chen’s gaze immediately shifted over to that pillar… My talent has gained its approval?”</p>
<p>The black clothed middle aged person’s face revealed a hard to cover astonishment. He simply didn’t think that this human who comes from another world that did not make him feel anything special about him and whose aura was instead pitifully weak would actually gain the approval of one of the powers! It needs to be known that in these past dozens of years, there have been countless people with extremely high talent from Azure Dragon City and even from Forgotten City, but no none could trigger resonance!</p>
<p>He started to re-examine this young man, at the same time unable but to speak out complimenting: “Very good! Congratulations! Looks like you possess shocking talent, actually gaining the recognition of the power left behind by a master!”</p>
<p>This middle aged person’s expression and voice all eased up a lot, because any person that had the qualifications to obtain one of the strength inheritances, later on all became world famous masters, no exceptions! Because the talent of people that can gain the recognition of the powers left behind in the Hall of Heroic Souls is very frightening, being able to become a peerless master is not too surprising. This person that can obtain recognition, maybe… No, it’s definitely, In the future he will definitely be a figure whose name will move the world!</p>
<p>Zheng…</p>
<p>The black clothed middle aged person had just finished speaking when a second pillar also lit up in a series of low noises, shining a pale white colour.</p>
<p>“Wh… What!?” The black clothed middle aged person’s face suddenly revealed an utterly shocked expression. Even his eyes instantly widened a bit…</p>
<p>“T… Two! You actually gained the recognition of two pillars at the same time!” The black clothed middle aged person yelled out in shock, even taking a few steps closer to confirm if he saw wrong.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Zheng…</p>
<p>Almost right after the second pillar, a third pillar also suddenly lit up, what it released was a light blue glow.</p>
<p>The black clothed middle aged person’s entire body froze, his eyes once again widening a bit more: “Th… Three… This, this is impossible!! Since the appearance of the Hall of Heroic Souls… there have only been 4 peerless geniuses who once simultaneously gained the recognition of two pillars, but there has never been a person who gained the recognition of three pillars… These powers are all different, how can there be a person who simultaneously possesses extremely high talent in three different kinds of power…”</p>
<p>Zheng… Zheng…</p>
<p>During the black clothed middle aged person’s mutterings of disbelief, a fourth and fifth pillar brightened at the same time, respectively releasing a light grey glow and a light purple glow.</p>
<p>The black clothed middle aged person was completely stunned, in his trembling gaze flashed 5 different colour… 5 colours that he could not believe.</p>
<p>Zheng… Zheng… Zheng… Zheng… Zheng…… Zheng…</p>
<p>Yet, the shock and disbelief that he bore did not stop there, in his pupils that had widened to the extreme, a sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth… and finally, even the eleventh pillar in the very middle, also flashed a light white colour.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>All eleven pillars were glowing vibrantly, covering this once darkened Hall of Heroic Spirits in a luminous light. These lights did not shine very intensely, but this glow completely astonished the middle aged man clothed in black. He could not believe his eyes.</p>
<p>The eleven pillars that symbolized the strongest of the Forgotten Continent were lit….all of them were lit! This meant that the man in front of him also obtained the acknowledgement of being worthy of all the heroes in this hall!</p>
<p>This abrupt situation made the middle age man unable to believe everything that was happening before his very own eyes.</p>
<p>“This….this is impossible…..even one with great talent, will only get the confirmation of one pillar, two at the very most, but all of these pillars are acknowledging him….Is his talent really at such a frightening level!” mumbled the black cloaked middle age man.</p>
<p>When he saw the first pillar glow, he was surprised, when he saw the second pillar light, he was shocked, and upon seeing the third, fourth, fifth…. and all the rest of the pillars all gleam brightly, there was only one thought left in his mind….He had to within a dream. An impractical dream, a dream that was so left far from reality that it could only be ludicrous. But his subconscious voice was telling him….that he was not dreaming.</p>
<p>The glow from the eleven pillars did not stop, in fact their light began to intensify, then they started glistening by fading and brightening in various patterns. The first pillar that gleamed quickly led the second pillar to glimmer as well, and soon all the pillars started glinting and the patterns of their glow accelerated….almost as if they were trying to capture Ling Chen’s attention, and lead him to chose themselves.</p>
<p>This was a scene that was never seen nor heard of before. The black cloaked middle aged man could not believe that he was not dreaming, because he has been guarding Hall of Heroic Spirits for decades, yet he could not find any words that could describe the situation before him.</p>
<p>But this situation was one that the Class Trainers predicted, because Ling Chen holds the skill of ‘Soul Sacrifice’. It meant that his spirit held enormous strength, this strength was one that all classes would greatly desire…..these pillars all yearned for such a person to succeed their class, because he would be able to utilize their abilities to the pinnacle….Just like how they throw away their pride to fight for him to chose their class. If the black cloaked middle aged man knew about how Ling Chen had already activated ‘Soul Sacrifice” beforehand, then he would not been this shocked.</p>
<p>“You….what is your name!” He asked with quivering as he stood behind Ling Chen and tried to calm himself down. In the past, he treated all that came into the Hall of Heroic Spirits coldly, no matter who it may be. He had never asked anyone their name or history before, this was the first time he instinctively asked the name of a challenger to the Hall of Heroic Spirits.</p>
<p>“Ling Tian” answered Ling Chen.</p>
<p>“Ling Tian…..” repeated the middle aged man who began to memorize this name as he took a deep breath, pointing towards the front stating: “As you have seen, all of the pillars had lit….. meaning that your talent has been acknowledged by all. But they have not only acknowledged you, they also seem to desire to be chosen by you….This is the first time that this has ever occurred since the Hall of Heroic Spirits was built. What you hold can be said to be the greatest talent that the Forgotten Continent has ever seen, there is almost no one that can be rival you.”</p>
<p>The analysis given by the middle aged man was the highest evaluation that could be given, and it was the greatest appraisal that he had given, even his voice was clearly shaking.</p>
<p>“Now, you can go forward….and determin the pillar that best suits you, or you can chose a strength that you like best….but remember you can only chose one, and you can only have one chance to succeed that one strength.” said the black cloaked middle aged man. But deep in his mind he still could not believe that such a situation was authentic, all this time it had always been the pillars who chose the heroes, and to be selected by any one of these pillars was the ultimate honor and great glory…..but now there is a person who had the power to freely decide which strength he desired. If this reality was not unfolding itself before his very eyes, no matter who told him about it, he would not have believed it.</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded his head as he proceeded closer towards the right, towards the glowing light red pillar.</p>
<p>“But be cautious, do not chose to the one in the middle….you have to remember this!” echoed the voice of the stern middle aged man behind Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s footsteps began to slow….even he doesn’t want me to touch the pillar in the middle, the warrior class trainer also told me this, what exactly is the middle pillar hiding?</p>
<p>But without asking much, Ling Chen walked up towards the first pillar and stood before it as he read the information concerning this strength within the red glow.</p>
<p>[Red Lotus Warrior]: This comes from the greatest warrior of the long lost Forbidden City, the ‘Red Lotus Sword God’. When one inherits this strength, their class will be changed to the “Red Lotus Warrior—Red Lotus Hero—Red Lotus King—? ? ? ?”. One will wield a sword with both their hands as their weapon, and their sword dance will ignite the red lotus karmatic fire. One will hold an attack power that is much greater than the average warrior’s, and one will also have fire abilities that the average warrior will never obtain, one’s strength will overwhelm all, and one is able to dance a sea of red lotus karmatic fire that is just as frightening as hell.</p>
<p>As Ling Chen stood in front of the first pillar, it’s red light gleamed brightly, craving him to chose itself and inherit its abilities onto him. Ling Chen stood in front of it for three whole minutes, before walking towards the second pillar.</p>
<p>The second pillar, glistened with a silvery white light.</p>
<p>[The Sky Court Archer]: This comes from the best archer of the Forgotten Continent, the hermit of the Sky Court, after one inherited this, their class will be changed into “Sky Court Archer—Holy Sky Court Archer—Sublime Sky Court Archer—? ? ? ?”. One will use the bow and arrow as weapons, every arrow that comes from the Sky Court Archer holds formidable power, no matter the distance or the strength will exceed normal archers greatly,and just one arrow will pierce the skies, and thousand arrows will drown the sea.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “……”</p>
<p>After a few minutes of silence, Ling Chen began to move towards the third pillar.</p>
<p>[Ice Poison Assassin]: This comes from the fearsome ‘Ice Demon Ghost” of the Forgotten Continent, after inheriting this one’s class will be be changed into “Ice Poison Assassin—Dark Ice Killer—Black Ice Poison Shadow—? ? ? ?”. One can use the short sword as their weapon, or they can chose to not use any weapons. One can use ice to attack anyone and limit their movements, as well as use poison to kill without warning. This skill is as frightening as the greatest venomous snakes of the grasslands.</p>
<p>The Fourth Pillar:</p>
<p>[Sword Spirit of the Dream Shadow]: This comes from the long lost “Absolute Sword of the Dream Shadow”, after inheriting one’s class will be changed into “ Sword Spirit of the Dream Shadow— Sword Soul of the Dream Shadow—-Sword Saint of the Dream Shadow—? ? ? ?”. One will hold dual swords as their weapon, one can chose to have a single sword in one hand or use dual swords in both hands. If one holds the same swords in both hands, then the might of the swords will be brought to the apex and when the swords dance together, they will be peerless.</p>
<p>“Ah?” The class description of the fourth pillar caught Ling Chen’s interest. This class allows you to wield two swords at the same time, counting his Gemini Orb, this was the second time he has seen the possibility for one to use dual two-handed weapons. Even if the strength of this class cannot be compared to the Gemini Orb….the Gemini Orb does not only allow one to use two weapons, but it also stacks the strengths of both weapons and that attribute allows it to far surpass the strength of this class….however that only proves that the Gemini Orb possesses an extraordinary capability, because this class is already much stronger than the normal classes, but if it could stack two weapons then it’s power would be much greater.</p>
<p>The fifth pillar….</p>
<p>[Elven Priest]: This comes from the number XXX “Elf Queen” of the Elf Clan that resides in the mysterious Elven Forest, after inheriting one’s class will be changed into “Elven Priest—Elven Chaplain—Elven Prophet—? ? ? ?”. One’s body will be circled in beautiful light of the Elves and one will hold strong healing and assisting abilities. One will also have the power to to control nature to attack their enemies, and those that inherit this will class will be welcome by the Elf Clan if they ever chose to enter the Elf Forest.</p>
<p>After the fifth pillar, there stood the biggest pillar in the middle, but Ling Chen did not stop, he passed this middle pillar and went straight to the sixth pillar, then the seventh pillar, the eighth pillar, the ninth pillar, and the tenth pillar.</p>
<p>Every pillar held a powerful class with great powers, each with their special attributes. There was no denying the fact that these classes all came the strongest heroes and these classes exceed normal hidden classes. Although normal hidden class were indeed stronger than the mundane classes, they do not surpass the mundanes one by a lot, there are even ones that are weaker than the mundane classes. However these classes surpassed the mundane ones by a whole other tier, no matter which one of these classes that one picked, one will still be able to become stronger than the mundane.</p>
<p>If all this information was leaked, then who knows who sort of mayhem will be caused by the all the players.</p>
<p>“Have you decided which one to pick?” asked the black cloaked middle aged man, seeing that Ling Chen has finished looking at all the pillars.</p>
<p>Ling Chen shook his head, walked up to the middle pillar: “There is still the last one left!”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to see that pillar, because you should not pick that one,” answered the middle aged man. But as he spoke, Ling Chen had already went up to the middle pillar, and was reading the information. Even though the pillar glowed, there was no information coming out of the pillar.</p>
<p>“Why can’t I pick this one?” asked Ling Chen: “If it is glowing that means that it wants me to inherit its powers right.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it has acknowledged your talent….however that only means you have talent.” answered the middle aged man with a stern face: “But in order to inherit this class, you need not only talent, but also you need it to acknowledge your strength. Even if you really want to inherit this power then you will have to go through a test of strength….Even if you hold frightening talent, that is merely just talent. You have only been in this world for a few days, no matter how much talent you have, your strength is no where enough to pass the test. The test made by the one who originally held this power is much harder than anything you can imagine. It is impossible to pass the test with the power you hold right now….you do not even hold a single thread or hair of chance!”</p>
<p>“Is the test really that frightening?” asked Ling Chen as he wrinkled his brows.</p>
<p>“I do not know, and there is no one that really knows.” replied the middle aged man shaking his head, “A thousand years have passed since the Hall of Heroic Spirits was created, there has been fifteen people who have received the acknowledgement of one or two of the pillars, but there are only nine that have inherited the powers and left this hall. Do you know why?”</p>
<p>“…..because six have challenged the test of the middle pillar?”said Ling Chen.</p>
<p>“Correct, these six were all acknowledged by the middle pillar, there were even two great geniuses that received the acknowledgement of two pillars. But because they chased after the strength of the middle pillar, they all attempted the test…..the six of them all far exceeded you. But….”</p>
<p>“They all failed?”</p>
<p>“No….they all died. Six living people were sent into this hell-like test, but the only thing that was sent out, was their dead bodies.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…..”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“They all… died?” Ling Chen said shocked.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” The middle-aged person slowly nodded his head: “The person who left behind this power is ‘War God’ who built this Hall of Heroic Souls. He is the publically accepted person who was closest to Saint Destroyer level strength in Forgotten Continent’s history, and is also the only person to be crowned with the title of ‘War God’. He was unbeatable and obsessed with the martial path. In his philosophy, one needs to experience true life and death ordeals to become an apex master. War God’s power is the first power to be left within the Hall of Heroic Spirits, but existing for 1000 years no one has been able to inherit it. Within 1000 years, a total of 6 people have gained its recognition, but they all died in the strength trial. Maybe, it is simply an impossible task to pass that trial targeted towards strength in a condition where level is lower that LV15.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged person’s expression was solemn, saying seriously: “Believe me, those 6 people were all geniuses among geniuses. They were born on Forgotten Continent, their beginning power level was already far superior to yours. When they accepted the trial, their strength was already a lot greater than yours. But the result is they all died… I know, you humans from another world will not truly die in this world. After death you will revive right away, only your strength will drop, that’s it. But, you need to know, every person only has one chance to enter the Hall of Heroic Souls. If you fail, even though you’ve gained the acknowledgment of all of the other powers, you will not have the right to inherit any single one of them. You are a true genius, if you succeed any of the other 10 powers you will be able to exert their strength to the greatest, do not make the choice that should not be made.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded his head in silence. The middle-aged person in black also let out a small sigh of relief… He was honestly afraid what Ling Chen would not think straight and pick the pillar in the middle. His talent is extremely shocking, but his strength… Going in the result will only be death.</p>
<p>Ling Chen shifted to the left a couple steps, seemingly wanting to once again ponder about the information of these powers. After taking three steps he abruptly stopped, his gaze returning to the middle pillar and stopping on it… After a long time, he opened his mouth saying: “The power in this pillar, is it the strongest?”</p>
<p>The thickness of the middle pillar is two, three times that of the other pillars.</p>
<p>“War God’s power is naturally far more superior than the others, although…”</p>
<p>“Okay, I choose this one in the middle!” Ling Chen turned around, using his finger to point at the pillar in the middle and saying expressionlessly.</p>
<p>“You…” the black clothed middle-aged man fiercely frowned: “Did you not listen to what I said!! I can very responsibly tell you that if you pick it, you will have no chance of passing in the test of strength., you might even die not even half way through the test! Even though you can revive after death, but, you will no longer have another chance to enter the Hall of Heroic Souls to accept the inheritances of the other powers!”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Ling Chn slightly nodded his head: “But, you also let me know that the power in this middle pillar is the strongest! And I, only chase after the strongest! No matter how scary the trial is, I still need to attempt it!”</p>
<p>“…” The black clothed middle-aged man slightly nodded his head, his eagle-like eyes focusing on his face: “Should I admire your decisiveness, or should I laugh at you overconfidence.”</p>
<p>“Even if I fail, all I lose is just a level, I will not regret. And if I give up because of the “danger” and “impossibility” that you mentioned, then I will look down on myself. In my entire life, how many time I’ve already turned the “impossible” into “reality”, you do not know!” Ling Chen slowly said. His determined voice and expression also told the middle-aged person, this decision of his will not change.</p>
<p>The black clothed middle-aged person looked at him with his eyebrows furrowed, staying silent for a long time, and then suddenly letting out a long sigh… Not sure if he was admiring Ling Chen’s courage and faith, or sighing about how another amazing genius was about to be stifled in the War God’s test.</p>
<p>“Since this is you choice, then it’s up to you.” The black clothed person said: “Your talent has already gained its recognition. If you want to accept the trial of strength then walk forward, place your hand on the pillar and then close your eyes… It will automatically send you to the mysterious test ground. And afterwards regardless if you succeed or fail, after sufficient time it will then send you back out. Go ahead.”</p>
<p>His expression was like already seeing the scene of Ling Chen returning in failure, and also made Ling Chen understand even better how scary the War God’s trial is. He glanced at the middle pillar, saying: “Before this, can I first go stock up. I pretty much have no potions left on me to use.”</p>
<p>The black clothed middle-aged person’s eye slightly flashed, after a little while he said: “According to the Hall of Heroic Souls’ rules, people that come attempting to receive power inheritances can only enter once in their lifetime. After they leave here they are not allowed to enter a second time… But, given your talent I’ll break the rules for you once… You have half an hour’s time.”</p>
<p>“Okay!!” Ling Chen slightly nodded his head, charging straight in the direction of the doors, and then pushing open the hall doors, quickly leaving.</p>
<p>Seeing Ling Chen’s figure disappear in his vision, the black clothed middle-aged man’s expression regained its coldness, his coldness carrying a slight sense of disappointment: “Being acknowledged by 11 powers at the same time, unprecedented. His talent can be said to be unprecedented, if this matter travels out it will be enough to shake all of Forgotten Continent. But he had to choose the War God’s test… Is he young and impetuous, haughty and rash, or… He actually has enough confidence…”</p>
<p>The moment the Hall of Heroic Souls’ door opened, the 7 class trainers who were standing at the entrance whispering to each all concentrated their eyes on Ling Chen’s body. They all widened their eyes, surprised at why he came out so quickly. But before they could say anything, they saw Ling Chen run away with a “Fwoosh” like a gust of wind, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>The seven class trainers were instantly dumbfounded, all of them looking at each other, not knowing what happened.</p>
<p>Ling Chen sprinted along the way charging straight to the item shop. Spending 20 gold buying 200 yellow potions, and then spending 30 gold buying 300 dark blue potions. After thinking for a bit, he then continued to buy another 100 dark blue potions. In the initial stage where gold coins are extremely scarce, there really aren’t that many people who dare to buy so many magic potions like him. 200 of these potions only took up one space in the inventory. Afterwards, he spent another 10 gold buying 10 town-teleport scrolls. Looking at his remaining gold coins, he bit his teeth and took them all out, buying an elementary strength crystal (Attack+6%), an elementary speed crystal (Movement Speed+6%), an elementary critical crystal (Critical Rate+2%), and an elementary pierce crystal (Pierce Rate+4%).</p>
<p>After throwing out 800 gold coins, his originally massive stash now only remained a few 30 something gold coins.</p>
<p>Taking a spin around the item shop and other surrounding shops, after not finding anything else that can assist him in battle he looked at the time and sprinted in the direction of the Hall of Heroic Souls.</p>
<p>“Yo!!! Kid did you…”</p>
<p>Fwoosh!</p>
<p>Bam!!</p>
<p>The 7 class trainers looked at him running over from a distance, not even finishing yelling out half a sentence Ling Chen had already darted past them like a gust of wind, closing the door on the way after entering the Hall of Heroic Souls. The 7 main class trainers who were ignored where once again dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“Have you really decided?” Seeing Ling Chen return, the black clothed middle-aged person asked unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>“Ya, I’ve decided. I’m heading over right now.” While speaking, Ling Chen arrived at the front of the middle pillar. He then extended his hand pressing towards the glowing pillar.</p>
<p>“Wait first.” The black clothed middle-aged person suddenly spoke out stopping him. Ling Chen’s movement stopped, turning around and looking towards him.</p>
<p>“Maybe my way of thinking is too reserved, maybe I should look forward to a certain possibility, or rather the appearance of a miracle, instead of trying to stop you.” The black clothed middle-aged man walked to his front, his gaze dark and quiet. Extending his hand he handed over a small package to Ling Chen: “Take this, your talent is enough to move the heavens and earth. And the talent that you possess, or maybe it shouldn’t be called talent… That should have been gained after undergoing effort or training that normal people are unable to imagine. If it’s like this, then maybe you really do have the chance to create a miracle. So, I hope that you can return in success… These things, I hope that they can be of assistance to you.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen lifted his eyes looking at him, taking over the package and slightly nodding his head saying: “Thank you.”</p>
<p>He then turned around, standing in front of the pillar, extending his right hand and placing it on the pillar.</p>
<p>Immediately, a mass of silver light released from the middle pillar, enveloping Ling Chen’s body. The next second, it carried Ling Chen disappearing from the Hall of Heroic Souls.</p>
<p>The scenery in front of Ling Chen’s eyes rapidly changed. When he opened his eyes, his gaze came in contact with only darkness, a strong smell of rot rushing at his nose.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have arrived at the hidden map ‘War God’s Trial Ground’.”</p>
<p>The overly strong odour of rotting made Ling Chen forced to hold his breath, shifting his gaze he looked around where he was right now. This is an incredibly old stone room, the smell of rot proves that no one has came here for who knows how many years. Rotten objects littered the ground and the walls. Besides this, the only item in this stone room is that stone statue in the innermost section of the room, along with the metal chest connected to the stone statue.</p>
<p>Hm? Chest?</p>
<p>Moving his feet Ling Chen walked towards that metal chest, and then tentatively extended his hand towards it. And right when his hand was about to touch the metal chest, a sound suddenly came from the stone statue in front.</p>
<p>“Very good… Finally another person has come here.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s movements immediately stopped. He took a step back, lightly saying: “Who are you?”</p>
<p>But the voice beside his ears did not pay attention to what he was saying, continuing to say: “Being able to come here says that your talent has already gained the approval of the power I left behind, you already possess half the qualifications to succeed my strength… But it is also only just half. If you want to obtain the inheritance of my strength, then walk to the end of this space and obtain the only key in this space to open the chest that you see. But in this space there exist many dangers that are sufficient to endanger your life. If you do not have enough courage, boldness and awareness, then stop your footsteps. As long as you stay in this room for over ten minutes, the power that I left behind will naturally send you away.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Aaaaand I’m back. Here’s a Chinese saying for people interested. “How can one settle the world without a flat chest, how can one gather the will of the people without a large bosom” (胸不贫何以平天下，乳不巨何以聚人心)… Cough cough, I just thought this was funny. Used in discussions of big vs small/flat. The words for settle and flat are pronounced the same and the words for large and gather are pronounced the same so this saying is a play on words. Um… enjoy the chapter…</p>
<p>The aged voice beside Ling Chen’s ears stopped, and also made him understand that this is the voice that War God left in this trial ground. The people that come here will all hear this voice, it is not someone talking to him.</p>
<p>Reach the end of this space, obtain that only key, and then open this metal chest before him. This is the content of this trial… Ling Chen turned around, looking towards the exit of this stone room. This stone room does not have a door and it is very bright outside. It should be a vast area of land. Not attempting again to touch the metal chest, Ling Chen turned around walking in the direction of the exit. The contents of the trial sounds very easy, but he knows how perilous it will be to reach the end of the space. Six geniuses that have already died in the trial are the best evidence.</p>
<p>Can I, really pass this trial?</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, Ling Chen does not have the confidence to pass this trial, he can even be said to have zero confidence. But, if he passes this trial, he will be able to obtain the strongest class. Even though in front of him there are only previous cases of failure, he still needs try with all of his strength.</p>
<p>Standing at the entrance, Ling Chen did not walk out, instead opening the small package that the Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian gave him. Inside there are two scrolls, a couple of potions, a wide piece of metal shaped like a fish scale, and a cylinder releasing a silver glow.</p>
<p>[Scan Scroll]: A scroll with the scan ability, after use can gain the detailed information of a monster no higher than 30 levels from you.</p>
<p>The two scrolls are both scan scrolls. At the time being able to defeat the Greedy Avarice Toad, the scan scroll played a key role. If not that he had first scryed all of the Greedy Giant Toad’s attack methods and weak points, maybe he would have already died at the beginning of the fight under the giant toad’s claws. So he very clearly understands the value and importance of these two scan scrolls.</p>
<p>[Aqua Celestial Scale]: Special item, a scale dropped from the high level Celestial beast Aqua Fish Emperor. By placing it in front one can fully withstand any melee attack from a Lv50 Celestial creature or below and can bounce it away. Can be used 5 times. Remaining Chances: 5.</p>
<p>(TL: Imagine armour made of this stuff.”</p>
<p>Fully withstand 5 melee attacks!! This is a miraculous item that can save one’s life when facing a lethal blow, moreover it’s 5 times! It can even be said without exaggeration that with this item, against powerful opponents that can one-shot him, it’s equal to him having an extra 5 lives!</p>
<p>[Moon God Spring Water]: Celestial grade recovery potion, spring water that originates from the Moon God Spring blessed by the Moon God Clan. After use HP and MP are all instantly fully recovered. Cooldown Time: 3 secs. Only effective for players.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Without question, this is the entire Mystic Moon world’s best, most ultimate recovery potion. It can recover all HP and MP in an instant and its cooldown time is only a short 3 seconds. He actually obtained this kind of most high grade potion at the most beginner level of the game. He couldn’t help but think of that middle aged person with a cold face in the Hall of Heroic Souls. What he gave him, was actually such shocking aid! Looks like he honestly hopes that I can pass this trial.</p>
<p>And only after seeing the last item that he gave him did Ling Chen realise how generous of a gift the middle-aged person had given him… He probably brought out everything that he had.</p>
<p>[Spirit Shield Orb]: Type: Energy Orb, Grade: Celestial, Attribute: None, Effect: All damage received reduced by 20%.</p>
<p>Ling Chen was stunned… This orb in his hand releasing a silver glow, is actually an energy orb.</p>
<p>The Novice Village village chief told him, even on Forgotten Continent energy orbs are still extremely rare items. Normal people might not even be able to see a real energy orb in their entire lives. And this middle-aged person from the Hall of Heroic Souls, he actually gave me a real energy orb! That black clothed middle-aged person’s strength is shrouded in mystery, but this energy orb for him is definitely still an extremely valuable item. He actually gave it to me just like that.</p>
<p>Ling Chen immediately felt that cold middle-aged person become very cute.</p>
<p>Actually, in the Hall of Heroic Souls when Ling Chen first made the decision to choose the middle pillar, the black clothed middle-aged person could not understand, he even felt deep disappointment. But, during the time that Ling Chen was preparing, he who had calmed down silently thought that, is it not just so that a person of true strength requires this kind of conviction of clearly knowing that the chances are next to zero but still resolutely moving forward… Maybe it is also only by possessing this kind of conviction can the people that experience this kind of trial have the qualifications to become an apex master… How can a person that makes ordinary decisions, become an unordinary person.</p>
<p>So, he decided to be impulsive once… Giving his most valuable items all to this person of extraordinarily high talent, hoping, the he really can create a miracle.</p>
<p>Decreasing all damage received by a whole 20%… This evidently includes physical damage and magical damage! The powerfulness of energy orbs once again showed before Ling Chen. With one energy orb one’s strength will increase greatly, this sentence is not false. With this energy orb he has another lucky charm against powerful opponents.</p>
<p>Although…</p>
<p>Holding this Spirit Shield Orb, Ling Chen’s gaze stopped on that “Attribute: None” annotation.</p>
<p>This is a non-elemental energy orb.</p>
<p>And… When at the Novice Village, the last condition for the awakening of that egg that Tao Tie entrusted to him, is exactly a non-elemental energy orb.</p>
<p>Should I use this energy orb to awaken it?</p>
<p>No doubt, with this energy orb that decreases all damage received by 20%, towards him passing this trial and the future opponents that he’ll face it is all a great assistance. This kind of powerful damage reduction effect is something that not even the beginner abilities of shield-guards can have. This is a defense orb that can be used until the last day of the game. If sold, it will undoubtedly sell for an astronomical number that will can scare people to death.</p>
<p>But on the other hand…</p>
<p>Tao Tie said that this beast egg was entrusted to him by a “great beast”. A beast that can be called a “great beast” by the ancient mythical beast Tao Tie, its strength has to be at the very least equal to Tao Tie’s!</p>
<p>This kind of beast… The descendant of this kind of beast, how powerful will it be. If he hatches it right now and it follows him, the role that it plays could far surpass an energy orb. And maybe… When that “great beast”’s descendant is born it will already have the might of Mysterious God, just casually breathing and all of the obstacles in front will be destroyed without a trace.</p>
<p>But, if it fails to hatch, or the hatched beastling doesn’t have enough time to awaken any power… For the course of this trial he will lose a powerful shield for no reason. It’s very possible that the trial that could initially be passed will fail due to not having this powerful protection orb.</p>
<p>Ling Chen started to hesitate… Exactly should he use the energy orb in his hand to hatch the beast egg that Tao Tie entrusted to him right now.</p>
<p>Silently hesitating for a long time, Ling Chen still hadn’t made a decision. He took out the four energy crystals that he bought from the item shop in Azure Dragon City and then slotted them into Lunar Scourge one by one.</p>
<p>“Ding… ‘Elementary Strength Crystal’ successfully slotted, physical attack strength+6%”</p>
<p>“Ding… ‘Elementary Pierce Crystal’ successfully slotted, pierce rate+4%”</p>
<p>“Ding… ‘Elementary Speed Crystal’ successfully slotted, movement speed+6%”</p>
<p>“Ding… You have already equipped ‘Heartless Orb’, cannot equip again energy crystals or orbs of the same type, ‘Elementary Critical Crystal’ slotting failed.”</p>
<p>“Ling Chen: “I…”</p>
<p>People always have the moment when they do something stupid. Holding the elementary critical crystal that he spent 200 gold coins to buy, Ling Chen knew that he’d wasted 200 gold coins! He prepared in too much of a rush, actually forgetting that energy crystals and orbs of the same type cannot be simultaneously equipped, buying a useless elementary critical crystal!!</p>
<p>After being depressed, he had no choice but to put away the elementary critical crystal, picking up the “Spirit Shield Orb”. Right now, his Lunar Scourge is already equipped with 6 different energy crystals or orbs, this is a number that current regular players don’t even dare to think of!</p>
<p>If he equips the Spirit Shield Orb, that will be the seventh.</p>
<p>The hand holding the Spirit Shield Orb stopped above Lunar Scourge, not falling down. After almost a minute of silence he finally took his hand away and then crouched down, taking out the beast egg from his inventory that Tao Tie entrusted to him and placing it in front of him.</p>
<p>The size of a soccer ball, a grey coloured body, like it’s made from a grey stone.</p>
<p>“Hope that you won’t disappoint me!”</p>
<p>While muttering, Ling Chen’s hand holding the Spirit Shield Orb stretched forward, touching it to the grey coloured beast egg.</p>
<p>Instantly, a grey glow slightly flickered over the beast egg for a moment, a strange feeling came from Ling Chen’s hand. He subconsciously released his hand, suddenly discovering that the Spirit Shield Orb has already been enveloped by a mass of grey light. And then slowly disappearing on the surface of the eggshell like being devoured.</p>
<p>The instant the Spirit Shield Orb was entirely engulfed, the grey light also completely disappeared. Just like that, everything, fell into silence.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>What’s going on? Didn’t Tao Tie say that the life form inside would hatch with just a non-elemental energy orb? Why is there no movement!?</p>
<p>Is it that what Tao Tie said is false… Or, Tao Tie himself also judged wrong!?</p>
<p>With the Spirit Shield Orb, he would have an extra layer of protection. Giving it to this beast egg right now is entirely a gamble… Gambling that the life form this egg hatches can give him help that surpasses the Spirit Shield Orb. But, the Spirit Shield Orb has been devoured and the beast egg doesn’t even have the slightest bit of movement.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s face twitched. But, an ancient mythical beast shouldn’t trick him. He kept calm, patiently waiting, hoping that the life form inside was just absorbing the energy of the Spirit Shield Orb and is about to come out right away.</p>
<p>One minute, two minutes, three minutes…</p>
<p>A whole five minutes passed by and the beast egg still didn’t have any movements, like a stone egg without any life. Ling Chen’s patience finally disappeared, letting out a depressed sigh and extending his hand preparing to take back the beast egg.</p>
<p>Crack…</p>
<p>The instant Ling Chen’s hand was just about to touch the beast egg, a thin, long crack accompanied by a light crackling sound appeared on the gray eggshell.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s right hand immediately stopped.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Um, grammar might not be the best again since I sorta rushed this out and I’m really tired. I’ve decided to change posting time to 19:00 GMT so that I can have more time to check over the translations. That’s 8 1/2 hours later than the previous post date. Why so much later you ask? Because I’m actually still asleep for the previous post date and I actually wake up a couple hours later.</p>
<p>Is it…</p>
<p>Looking at the thin long crack that appeared on the grey eggshell, Ling Chen’s heart started to beat faster. Is the life form inside about to come out?</p>
<p>Crack… Crack…</p>
<p>Ling Chen took back his hand, his body getting close and staring at the eggshell that had already started rocking. In the light cracking sound, a second, third… Even more cracks closely followed appearing on the eggshell, painting the originally smooth eggshell with cracks. Finally, the eggshell started to break open from the center… A little grey paw slowly stretched out from the broken area. Following, in a series of light fiddling sounds another piece of the eggshell fell, a cute fluffy little grey head carefully stretching out from the eggshell.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Following his aura, the newborn little life lifted up its delicate little head and looked towards Ling Chen who was staring straight at it. Immediately, its muddy eyes brightened up a lot, in its eyes a cleverness filled with affection and joy. It moved its body, throwing off the eggshell it was stuck in and then jumping up with a “Fwoosh”, jumping to Ling Chen’s feet. It’s small, delicate soft body gently and affectionately rubbed against his calf, its mouth releasing kitten like whining sounds.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s gaze froze on its body, his mind wandering for a long time.</p>
<p>Normally speaking… The eyes of a newborn creature should not be open and their hair/fur should not be fully grown. But this creature’s eyes are even brighter than a star, just now when it jumped out from the eggshell it was also faster than wind, the grey fur on its body is also long and soft… No matter how you look at it it doesn’t look like the condition of just being born from the egg.</p>
<p>Ok, this stuff isn’t important, what made Ling Chen stumped is its appearance, because… its appearance can only be summed up with one sentence…</p>
<p>This is just a damned grey puppy!</p>
<p>Less than 20 cm long, its entire body covered in grey, velvety fur, a slightly short tail, pointy ears, its overall appearance is pretty much the exact same as husky puppies that Ling Chen’s seen… Of course, there are also differences, and that is that on this “puppy’s” forehead there is a long, grey horn. Besides that, Ling Chen honestly couldn’t find any more differences about its appearance from a husky’s.</p>
<p>If you had to force him to say a difference, then that is… huskies from Earth are not born from eggs.</p>
<p>This is the descendant of the “great beast” Tao Tie talked about?</p>
<p>Is it that in this world if you place a horn on a husky that can be seen all over the place on Earth then it’ll freaking become an ancient mythical beast?</p>
<p>In Ling Chen’s expectations, the image of a “great beast’s” descendant should be domineering and imposing, even a bit scary, like Tao Tie making people afraid by taking a glance at him. Just like a newborn baby tiger will also give people a sort of king of the jungle feeling. But this newborn baby beast… grey and fluffy it’s honestly a little too cute. Don’t talk about giving people a sense of deterrence, it’s so cute that he’s already had the impulse to cuddle it a couple times… It simply has nothing to do with the name of ancient mythical beast.</p>
<p>The little creature has been lightly rubbing against his body the entire time, its black eyes also looked at him longingly and affectionately the whole time… The majority of creatures born from an egg will treat the first creature they see after birth as their parents or their closest person, this little creature is evidently also like so.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have hatched ‘Unknown Creature’, system has already named the creature based on its innate talent, named as ‘Holy Spirit Beast’.”</p>
<p>“Ding… ‘Holy Spirit Beast’ requests to become your pet. After a creature becomes your pet, you’ll be able to summon them at any time to help with combat. Under the condition that a pet has been summoned, a pet will split 10% of your experience to engage in personal growth. After pets die they need to be revived at the revival stone, they cannot be summoned again before revival, pets will also receive a death penalty of level dropping. A pet’s obedience is related to its loyalty, the higher the loyalty, the higher its degree of obedience towards the owner. If the owner treats the pet well, it can increase loyalty, if the owner treats the pet poorly, it will cause loyalty to drop. And when a pet dies once, its loyalty towards the owner will greatly drop. When obedience drops to a certain degree it will leave the owner and run away. You currently can have at most 3 pets at a time, each time you can only summon 2 pets at the same time, do you accept the self attachment of the ‘Holy Spirit Beast’.”</p>
<p>The little creature’s tale slowly wagged, its little eyes looking at him, a look on its face that it would cry if Ling Chen didn’t agree to it.</p>
<p>“Accept.” Even though he is a bit stumped about this baby beast’s appearance, Ling Chen still chose to accept. Right now he could only hope that it was just the appearance of this baby beast that was a bit deceiving, its stats… Ling Chen hoped that they could give him a surprise.</p>
<p>Holy Spirit Beast… No matter how you hear it it has a sort of domineering sense. Just like how his name is “Ling Tian”. (TL: Ling Tian, Above the Heavens)</p>
<p>The little creature’s eyes instantly became very bright. It whimpered twice excitedly, its body suddenly flashing a weak grey glow for an instant. The grey light detached from its body and then assimilated into Ling Chen’s body.</p>
<p>“Ding… ‘Holy Spirit Beast’ has successfully become your pet, please pick a nice nickname for your ‘Holy Spirit Beast’.”</p>
<p>“If it’s a nickname…” Ling Chen glanced at his fluffy grey body a couple times, randomly saying: “I’ll call it “Little Grey” then.” (TL: Or Grey, Greyie? Leave a suggestion.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Pet ‘Little Grey’ successfully named.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have gained the first Celestial grade pet in the world, the matter has been recorded into the World Hall of Fame, the pet ranking list of the China region you are in has been unlocked. You’ve gained Fame+200, SP+200, number of possessable pets+1, simultaneously summonable pets+1 as rewards. System will release a global announcement, do you wish to hide your personal information?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was suddenly dazed for a moment.</p>
<p>He was shocked, not because he gained the first pet in the world, and not because he gained the reward of number of possessable pets increasing… But because what the system mentioned was clearly a “Celestial grade pet”!</p>
<p>The grades of the pets that players possess from lowest to highest can be split as grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, grade 4, grade 5, Celestial, Heaven End, Mysterious God and Saint Destroyer. Grade 1 pets are just to play with, they do not have any ability to help in battle, grade 2 are low grade pets. Grade 3 are intermediate pets, their overall strength is above low grade pets. Grade 4 are high-grade pets, they will have their own attack or assist skills. Grade 5 are mature pets with well rounded abilities. And grade 5 and above, are the super pets that players dream of but basically can’t appear. By possessing a pet thats grade surpasses grade 5, regardless if it’s overall ability or levelling speed they will all gain a huge upgrade. But due to these high grade pets being too strong, their numbers are also extremely few… Their chances of appearing are pretty much the same as hidden professions.</p>
<p>For a time, Ling Chen didn’t know if he should be thrilled or if he should be depressed. Thrilled… Any player that obtained a Celestial pet would probably be able to laugh even in their dreams, being thrilled is certain. But this is the descendant of the “great beast” Tao Tie talked about, he originally faintly hoped for the appearance of a Mysterious God level baby beast or something like that…</p>
<p>Truly it was just an overly glorious fantasy.</p>
<p>But he then let it go, crouching down and petting Little Grey’s head, slightly smiling. Regular players even if they tried for their entire lives might not even be able to touch a Celestial pet, and he gained one without wasting practically any effort, he should indeed be very satisfied.</p>
<p>“No need.” He lifted his head responding to the system’s question. Immediately, the skies rang with the system notification that covered the entire world.</p>
<p>“Ding… Global announcement! All players in the world please pay attention, China region player ‘Ling Tian’ as of 5:19 in the morning today obtained the first pet of all the warzones, at the same time obtaining the first Celestial pet of all the warzones. This matter has been recorded into the World Hall of Fame, China warzone pet ranking list unlocked. Player ‘Ling Tian’ has gained system rewards: Fame+200, SP+200, number of possessable and summonable pets limit+1. Pets can be obtained through capturing, hatching the pet eggs dropped from monsters, along with buying, trading, special missions, etc, hope that all of the players can continue working hard and obtain your own pet companion.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Global announcement…”</p>
<p>“Ding… Global announcement…”</p>
<p>“Ding… China warzone announcement, player ‘Ling Tian’ has honourably obtained China region’s first pet, at the same time obtaining the first Celestial pet, triggering the condition to unlock the pet ranking list. China region pet ranking list unlocked, players can now view it.”</p>
<p>Buzz–</p>
<p>Just a little over one hour ago, the entire world was just in an uproar because of the name “Ling Tian”. Because the player with the name “Ling Tian” was the first person to walk out of the Novice Village, and left behind the rest of the players by a large margin. And right now, the whole world is once again in an uproar because of this name.</p>
<p>If it was just him gaining the world’s first pet, it wouldn’t be too much of a shock, but the pet the system notification mentioned… was actually a Celestial grade!!</p>
<p>China Region Pet Ranking List</p>
<p>Holy Spirit Beast: Grade: Celestial, Level: LV0, Owner: Ling Tian.</p>
<p>“A Celestial grade pet… are you kidding!!” This was the shout of disbelief in the hearts of god knows how many players.</p>
<p>“Aren’t Celestial grade pets only in late game!! How is this possible!”</p>
<p>“Holy shit, is this real! Is there a problem with my ears!! I haven’t even seen a Celestial pet in my life yet!”</p>
<p>“Ling Tian again… Exactly where did this beast pop out from! Could it be some expert from the Heaven Ranking has changed his/her name? A Celestial pet, how are we supposed to live!”</p>
<p>……………………</p>
<p>The sound of the players’ discussion covered the Novice Villages’ land, and following the sound of this system notification, some people also started to truly focus their gaze on the name “Ling Tian”. Obtaining the first Celestial item can be explained as encountering incredible luck, being the first to leave the Novice Village can be explained as having a powerful Celestial item, adding farming like crazy which is why he can surpass the other players. But now, once more obtaining the first Celestial pet…</p>
<p>This time, can it really be attributed as luck?</p>
<p>“Ling Tian again, the first person in the world to obtain a Celestial item, the first person in the world to leave the Novice Village. Now when practically everyone is still at the Novice Village, he actually gained a Celestial pet. Looks like he’s already no longer a person we can’t pay attention to. How’s the investigation about his information?”</p>
<p>“Besides knowing that he clashed with the Black Flame Alliance before nothing else is known. Xiao Qiufeng seems to have seen him but he doesn’t wish to tell, only saying that he isn’t any person on the current Heaven Ranking and Earth Ranking. At the same time also saying a line… ‘He will be a very scary opponent’.”</p>
<p>“Someone Xiao Qiufeng calls a “scary opponent”, looks like that is indeed not a person who just depends on luck. Being able to take so many ‘number 1 persons’ also simply cannot be luck.”</p>
<p>“Young master, you mean?”</p>
<p>“Continue to track his location. Of course, its best if you can discover his real identity. Like before… This kind of person, either we control him in our hands, or completely strangle him before he can fully develop. Although, he… I actually hope he chooses not to be roped in by us, right now I am very interested in his ‘Soaring Cloud’ and the Celestial pet he just got!”</p>
<p>“He, young master, you might not be able to get your wish this time. If he hears the name ‘Yan Huang Alliance’ he’ll probably be scared half to death. I don’t believe that he has the balls to defy young master’s wish.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>About my side projects, Super Powered Teacher is still on hiatus and I’m thinking of dropping it, for Lolicon, that’s going on temporary hiatus too. I’d like too work on just one side project so I’m going to hunt around for a bit more before deciding my side project. My thought is that I’ll create a page with the synopsis and information of novels I’m interested in and then make a poll and you guys can vote. Although the final word is still mine.</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit Beast] (Xiao Hui): Type: Beast Pet, Level: LV0, Grade: Celestial, Owner: Ling Tian. Attached on its own, will never betray. A strange beast of unknown origin, has a cute appearance and a very peaceful and docile nature. Hates fighting, does not seek any battle ability, thus it does not possess any combat ability. But it has a body with strong vitality and agility, along with mysterious strength of unknown attributes. Has a mysterious aura that makes even mother nature want to get close to it, very easily causes other life forms to have a good impression of it, makes even the most evil creatures hard to develop the desire to attack it.</p>
<p>Looking at Xiao Hui’s introduction, even though Ling Chen was prepared he was still a bit disappointed. When Tao Tie entrusted the egg to him, he said that the creature hatched will essentially not have any combat ability, instead it will give him some powerful support. The first half of Tao Tie’s words has come true… Xiao Hui’s introduction clearly writes that it does not have any combat ability… Directly none at all.</p>
<p>Attributes: HP: 2000, MP: 50, Physical Attack Strength: 1, Magic Attack Strength: 1, Physical Defense: 200, Hit Rate: 1, Dodge Rate: 1, Critical Hit Rate: 50%, Pierce Rate: 50%, Movement Speed: 300.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!”</p>
<p>Xiao Hui’s stats were particularly extreme, physical attack ability and magic attack ability are all at a point that they could not be lower, inferior to even the lowest level creature the LV1 buck-toothed-rabbit. That super flamboyant pierce ability and critical ability are entirely just for show. But its vitality… At a LV0 state its actually has a whole 2000 HP! More than 5 time of the currently LV10 him! Ling Chen was confident that even a Heaven End pet couldn’t have 2000 HP at the initial level… Defense, is also as high as 200!</p>
<p>Its movement speed is especially shocking, actually reaching 300! Almost triple of his!! HP can be rapidly increased following the increase of level and through the use of many different methods, but the increasing of movement speed is extremely difficult. Players can basically only depend on boots/shoes or special items along with the movement speed added by mounts to increase movement speed. Even assassins that change to their final class, their movement speed basically cannot surpass 200. Yet Xiao Hui’s initial value is 300.</p>
<p>“It does not have any combat ability. But it has a body with strong vitality and agility”, its stats perfectly explained this line.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, regardless if it’s its HP or movement speed they all made Ling Chen’s teeth itch with envy and jealousy. If these two attributes appeared on him, he even dared to go straight to the territory of LV30 monsters right now. Unfortunately, Xiao Hui who is carrying this powerful HP and movement speed does not have any combat ability, the two abilities… Evidently exist for protecting itself and running away.</p>
<p>Then what exactly are its support skills? Ling Chen expectantly looked towards its talent and initial skills.</p>
<p>Innate Gifts:</p>
<p>Can freely move about on land and water. Is especially sensitive towards dangerous aura, can sense the approaching of danger beforehand. Is very sensitive towards the smell of high-grade ores, energy crystals, energy orbs and all kinds of treasures. Can discover and accurately locate their locations from a long distance.</p>
<p>Unless it attacks or taunts others on its own, it usually will not be attacked by any creature.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui’s innate gifts made Ling Chen slightly stunned. This beast thats appearance looks like a puppy can actually freely move about underwater. It can predict in advance the arrival of danger… it can even discover high-grade treasures!! Just this one point is already a relatively strong assist ability!</p>
<p>In the game world, there are countless player that personally head towards dangerous mines excavating all day and night to forge the weapon of their dreams, hoping that they can obtain a high-grade ore enough to forge their dream weapon. Sometimes even a dozen days of effort will be all for naught. If Xiao Hui really does have this kind of ability and its sensitivity and discovery range are enough, then if he reaches a place with treasure, won’t it be able to discover the exact location right away?</p>
<p>As for its second innate gift it more or less made Ling Chen a bit speechless. As long it it doesn’t provoke others, other creatures will not mess with it… If he had this ability, wouldn’t he be able to leisurely travel across all of Forgotten Continent right now.</p>
<p>Innate Skills:</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit Shield]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV5, Level required to upgrade to LV2: LV20. An invisible shield that is always protecting around the surroundings of the Holy Spirit Beast’s body, can forcibly decrease all damage received by 30%. When HP is higher than 70%, will not die after receiving a lethal blow and HP will be reserved at 1. HP recovers 5% every second, after death can directly revive on the spot, HP will recover to max, will not have any losses, can revive 3 times a day.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “Holy mother of freaking Jesus!!”</p>
<p>Just Xiao Hui’s first ability made Ling Chen so shocked that he almost erupted… [Holy Spirit Shield], this is absolutely for sure the most OP defense skill Ling Chen has ever seen in his life! All damage forcibly decreased by 30%, can never be one-shotted when HP is above 70%, HP automatically recovers by large amounts, can revive on the spot 3 times a day… Gathering all kinds of outrageous defense effects in one!</p>
<p>Even scarier is this is still just the level 1 state of this defense skill! What kind of state max level of LV5 will be is practically unimaginable!</p>
<p>Ling Chen opened his eyes wide staring at this petite little creature that looked like it could be randomly stomped to death, as if wanting to see where exactly its hidden shield is!</p>
<p>This little guy doesn’t have any attack ability… But its self defense ability is honestly outrageously strong.</p>
<p>[Soul Devour]: Cannot be upgraded. Matures by devouring the bodies of dead creatures, and at the same time using holy spirit force to refine the parts that cannot be absorbed, spitting out an unknown item of the respective attribute.</p>
<p>[Note: The growth of the Holy Spirit Beast is not through experience, but through Soul Devour].</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>Devouring the bodies of creatures? Ling Chen glanced at the petite creature, wondering how big of a thing that small body of its can swallow. As for what it spit out after refinement… hope it’s not bones. But the information in the note made him take notice… Its growth is actually not by absorbing the owner’s experience but instead relying upon itself and devouring the bodies of creatures. He’d never heard of this before.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui really has too many unusual points.</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit’s Aura]: Current Level: LV0, Highest Level: LV20, Level required to upgrade to LV1: LV1, locked, effect unknown.</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit’s Gift]: Current Level: LV0, Highest Level: LV20, Level required to upgrade to LV1: LV1, locked, effect unknown.</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit’s Eye]: Current Level: LV0, Highest Level: LV20, Level required to upgrade to LV1: LV10, locked, effect unknown.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui had a lot of initial skills, but besides that scaringly powerful Holy Spirit Shield and that kind of strange Soul Devour, the rest are all under an unawakened state, although two of them only require to reach LV1 to awaken. Repeatedly reading Xiao Hui’s skills again, Ling Chen then picked up Xiao Hui examining him, trying hard to find some areas that are different from a puppy’s.</p>
<p>Whatever… I should deal with the trial in front.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui, from now on you’ll need to go adventuring with me, lets go!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen did not recall it… Monsters won’t automatically attack it anyways, even if it is hit by a large area super attack… Ling Chen will definitely die before it. Towards the name “Xiao Hui”, Xiao Hui clearly didn’t have any objections, following Ling Chen’s steps it also obediently followed over in excitement… With its movement speed that reached 300 it bypassed in front of Ling Chen in the blink of an eye, making him open his mouth in jealousy.</p>
<p>Before stepping out of the stone room, Ling Chen confirmed his current stats… Basic attack strength has surpassed 300, this is also the strongest attribute he possessed. SP reached 930 with the reward just now, it can already upgrade Heaven Wind Technique or Item Manipulation Technique one level.</p>
<p>Thinking for a moment Ling Chen put 800 SP into Heaven Wind Technique, a series of lights flashed by and Heaven Wind Technique successfully upgraded.</p>
<p>[Heaven Wind Technique]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level: LV10. Sp to Upgrade to LV3: 1600. Ancient battle technique, after practice it can greatly increase the ability to control any weapon. Effect: When using any weapon, damage dealt is increased by 10%. Effect does not stack with other weapon proficiency skills.</p>
<p>Looking at his remaining 130 points of SP and the 1600 SP required to upgrade Heaven Wind Technique again, Ling Chen let out a depressed sigh. This is the ancient battle technique the warrior trainer talked about that had been lost for 10000 years, its effect is indeed shocking, but the SP required to upgrade it is also equally shocking… Adding the effect of “Heaven’s Jealousy”, it was even more shocking.</p>
<p>Walking out of the stone room, the scenery before him instantly lit up. What displayed before Ling Chen’s eyes was not the oppressive atmosphere filled with murderous intent that he’d envisioned, but instead a massive garden filled with crisp green vegetation along with colourful flowers!</p>
<p>This place is…</p>
<p>“Woof…” Xiao Hui let out an excited shout, moving its four limbs and running forward in joy. It then jumped up high, allowing itself to fall on the grassland. After it landed on the grass it rolled around in comfort, displaying an incredibly satisfied posture. But suddenly, it jumped up from the grass with a “Fwoosh”, arching its body and staring straight at the cluster of vegetation not too far away from it, its mouth letting out a low growl.</p>
<p>Ling Chen also detected something, knitting his eyebrows and looking towards the direction Xiao Hui is facing, Soaring Cloud and Sand Blade simultaneously appearing in his hands.</p>
<p>In the vegetation cluster there was a series of wiggling, following a couple of emerald coloured figures sprang out, heading straight for Ling Chen. Focusing his eyes and looking over… they’re actually a couple of plants that can move… There’re even green leaves sticking on them.</p>
<p>[Plant Faerie]: Type: Demon, Level: LV10, HP: 360, Originally a regular plant, afterwards under the influence of the strength left behind by “War God” it came alive and had weak strength. Likes auras of purity, will automatically attack outside beings that can endanger them.</p>
<p>[Xiao Hui really is very strong]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>It’s just a group of regular LV10 monsters, they should naturally exist here and are not monsters of the trial.</p>
<p>With Ling Chen’s current overall ability, LV10 regular monsters are garbage-like existences in his eyes, he doesn’t even need to look at them. He moved his feet, heading straight for the 5 plant faeries. When he got close his left and right hand both lashed out, two overlapping Crescent Slashes enveloping the 3 plant faeries at the very front. After a series of crackling breaking sounds the three plant faeries turned into a pile of dead plants without any surprise. Ling Chen’s feet didn’t move, letting the remaining two plant faeries charge to his front. Not even looking he slashed out another two Crescent Slashes.</p>
<p>Papapa…</p>
<p>The last two plant faeries also fell down. If it’s a single handed attack without any buffs, without a critical attack he really couldn’t one shot these plant demons. But with two Crescent Slashes at once, they’d have to die even if they didn’t want to.</p>
<p>The 5 plant faeries that were killed dropped a bunch of green leaves, there wasn’t even a copper coin.Ling Chen took a glance and couldn’t be bothered to pick them up. He knows these are not trial monsters, and how can this level of monsters be worthy of becoming monsters in the War God’s trial. He lifted his head looking forward… This place, perhaps it should be War God’s former residence, out of here, is the true trial ground.</p>
<p>“Woof!”</p>
<p>Looking at the plant faeries that fell on the ground, Xiao Hui let out a series of excited cries and then thumpingly ran to the side of the plant faerie corpses. Stretching its neck and opening its mouth, immediately a large mass of grey light suddenly burst from its mouth, completely enveloping the corpses of the 5 plant faeries. The next second, under the grey light the corpses of the 5 plant faeries rapidly dissolved, dispersing into countless little particles and then following the the pull of the grey light flying into Xiao Hui’s mouth.</p>
<p>Everything happened under Ling Chen’s gaze. Just like that the corpses of the 5 plant faeries following the grey light were all engulfed by Xiao Hui, disappearing without any remains. Xiao Hui that had devoured the corpses of the 5 plant faeries closed its mouth, its face revealing a satisfied expression, but its body did not have any changes… Yet, the bodies of the 5 plant faeries added together are multiple time larger than Xiao Hui’s body, exactly where did Xiao Hui devour them to?</p>
<p>This is Xiao Hui’s “Soul Devour”?</p>
<p>While Ling Chen was bewildered, a white halo slowly floated up from Xiao Hui’s body.</p>
<p>“Ding… Your pet ‘Holy Spirit Beast’ Xiao Hui has successfully risen to LV1, HP+200, MP+5, Defense+20.”</p>
<p>Killing 5 LV10 monsters, the experience Ling Chen gained did not have any reductions, Xiao Hui also did not level up, this said that Xiao Hui will indeed not split his experience. It also doesn’t rely on experience to level up, instead after devouring 5 plant faeries Xiao Hui’s level directly upgraded… Its level up did not make Ling Chen surprised, but what made Ling Chen unable but to be surprised was… The one level that it rose actually added 200 points of HP and 20 points of defense! Ling Chen himself only naturally gains 10 points of HP from levelling up! If things continue according to this magnitude, when Xiao Hui reaches the current LV10 that he is at, won’t it have 4000 points of HP and 400 points of defense.</p>
<p>This is practically…</p>
<p>“Ding… Your pet’s innate skills ‘Holy Spirit’s Aura’, ‘Holy Spirit’s Gift’ unlocked.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Your Luck+1, Comprehension+1, your skills ‘Heaven Wind Technique’ level increased to LV3, ‘Item Manipulation Technique’ level increased to LV2, ‘Soul Sacrifice’ level increased to LV3.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>What… What’s going on!?</p>
<p>Luck increased, comprehension increased… the level of all skills that can be upgraded suddenly all upgraded one level…</p>
<p>What’s the case? Did something go wrong somewhere? Or is there a problem with my ears.</p>
<p>In his bewilderment, Ling Chen rapidly opened his stat page, looking at those 3 upgradeable skills of his.</p>
<p>[Soul Sacrifice]: Current Level: : LV3, Highest Level LV4, SP to Upgrade to LV4: 50000, An impasse skill that uses your life and soul as an offering in exchange for the most extreme attack strength. Only people with a strong mind and conviction can unlock and trigger it. After activating HP=1, Physical Attack Strength+300%, Magic Attack Strength+300%, the use any skill has no consumption (including HP and MP consumption), Duration: 20 secs, and cannot be stopped while in use, cannot use any method of HP recovery. Cooldown Time: 200secs.</p>
<p>[Heaven Wind Technique]: Current Level: LV3, Highest Level: LV10. Sp to Upgrade to LV4: 2400. Ancient battle technique, after practice it can greatly increase the ability to control any weapon. Effect: When using any weapon, damage dealt is increased by 15%. Effect does not stack with other weapon proficiency skills.</p>
<p>[Item Manipulation Technique]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level: LV10. Sp to Upgrade to LV3: 1600. Ancient battle technique, after practice equipment that surpasses your current level can be equipped. Effect: Ignores any piece of equipment’s level requirement by 2 levels.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Heaven Wind Technique, Item Manipulation Technique… Even Soul Sacrifice that required a whole 10000 points of SP to upgrade all upgraded one level. The system notification that he just heard was not a problem with his ears?</p>
<p>Exactly what’s going on? Could it be that I’ve inadvertently triggered some kind of amazing reward? Or the system’s in disorder? Or is my mind in a trance.</p>
<p>Wait a sec, is it…</p>
<p>Ling Chen promptly closed the skill page, looking towards Xiao Hui’s two newly unlocked innate skills.</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit’s Aura]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV20, Level required to upgrade to LV2: LV5, Using its Holy Spirit Aura that is void of evil and impurity to seek the protection of mother nature, upgrades the innate gifts of itself and all companions. Effect: Luck+1 and Comprehension+1 of itself along with the master and all pet companions. Effect exists even while not summoned.</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit’s Gift]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV20, Level required to upgrade to LV2: LV20. Using Holy Spirit Force to bless the master, increasing the level of all of his/her skills. Effect: Level of all skills of master+1 (Ineffective towards skills that are already max level, directly takes effect towards new skills that appear later). Effect exists even while not summoned.</p>
<p>Looking at the two innate skills Xiao Hui just unlocked Ling Chen was silent for a long time.</p>
<p>He found the reason why his 3 skills suddenly upgraded, and also finally understood exactly what the “powerful support” Tao Tie talked about is.</p>
<p>Holy Spirit’s Aura, forever increasing Luck and Comprehension, adding one to Luck and Comprehension under a LV1 state and the highest level is LV20. This also means that after it reaches max level, it can very likely forever add 20 points of Luck and Comprehension! With the degree of value of the Luck attribute and Comprehension attribute, this is an incredibly terrifying amount! And compared to Holy Spirit’s Aura, Holy Spirit’s Gift was especially ecstatically powerful… Actually able to forever increase the level of all skills — This is a skill enough to make any player scream out of control after seeing it.</p>
<p>Heaven Wind Technique, Item Manipulation Technique and Soul Sacrifice all upgraded… In a way this is the same as making Ling Chen gain 10000 SP. Or else, who knows what year and month Ling Chen would be able to upgrade Soul Sacrifice to LV3. Moreover, Holy Spirit’s Gift also directly takes effect towards later skills, meaning that if he gains new skills in the future, the level of the new skills will directly upgrade one level!</p>
<p>Soul Sacrifice has currently already reached LV3, one more level and it’ll be max level. What it needs, is a whole 50000 points of SP. A number that can scare away the souls of people. Soul Sacrifice’s powerfulness is without doubt, shocking the 7 main class trainers into all kinds of erratic states is proof enough. But its upgrade difficulty is also extremely shocking, especially the SP required to reach max level. If Ling Chen continues to regularly earn SP like this, even if he doesn’t upgrade other skills who knows until what year and month he’ll need to toil until. But now… Holy Spirit’s Gift can upgrade to LV2 when Xiao Hui levels up to LV20. At that time its effect should be all skill levels+2, his Soul Sacrifice will also automatically upgrade to max level… Just this one skill, can save 50000 SP!</p>
<p>Xiao Hui that had just devoured 5 plant faeries seemed to still be digesting, its eyes lazily half opened. Looking at Xiao Hui at this time, Ling Chen increasingly felt it become cuter, cute to the point that he wanted to pick it up and kiss it a couple time… This kind of support ability isn’t just powerful, it can practically be described with “cheat”.</p>
<p>“Burp…”</p>
<p>The eyes of Xiao Hui that had finished swallowing finally completely opened, its body shaking, seems like it let out a burp. It shook its head, another “Burp” sound… Suddenly, a dark green rock like item was coughed out from its mouth, landing on the grass. Xiao Hui’s eyes lit up, hurriedly running over to that little green stone and picking it up. It then ran over to Ling Chen with a “Fwoosh” placing the dark green little rock in front of him and then wagging its tale, opening wide its round eyes staring at him, a posture of asking for a reward.</p>
<p>This is the refined item after devourment in Xiao Hui’s Soul Devour description?</p>
<p>Ling Chen bent his waist, picking up this green coloured little rock.</p>
<p>[Plant Faerie Stone]: The crystallization of the plant faerie’s energy source refined from its body, has a pure life aura, after eating it can forever increase HP by 10 points.</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“…..”</p>
<p>“!!!!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s mouth opened, one moment looking at the green stone in his hand, one moment staring at Xiao Hui that is wagging its tail, unable to speak for a long time.</p>
<p>This thing Xiao Hui refined out from devouring the bodies of the monsters… Is actually an item that forever increases an attribute!!</p>
<p>Before he didn’t really think too much of [Soul Devour] this innate skill, thinking this was mainly a skill Xiao Hui used to engage in self growth. Toward the items refined out after devourment he even directly thought of them as the leftover bones or something like that… Looking at this Plant Faerie Stone he realised how laughable his thoughts were. Plant Faerie is just a regular LV10 monster and what it refined out is an item that forever increases a stat. If it’s a higher level, higher grade monster… refined out would undoubtedly be an even stronger item!!</p>
<p>Right now at this moment, Ling Chen no longer had a hint of dissatisfaction towards Xiao Hui’s characteristic of not having any attack ability, because its support ability entirely masked its flaw. He was even more clear how massive of an aid he’d gained from hatching out Xiao Hui!</p>
<p>“Good job, Xiao Hui!” Ling Chen crouched down lightly patting Xiao Hui’s head and complimenting saying. Xiao Hui that had gained his compliment was so excited that it continuously jumped around on the ground, its tail also wagging even more cheerfully.</p>
<p>Ling Chen opened his mouth, directly throwing the Plant Faerie Stone into his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have eaten special item ‘Plant Faerie Stone’, Max HP forever+10.”</p>
<p>Without surprise, Ling Chen’s max HP really increased 10 points. He turned his body, looking towards the plant cluster where the plant faeries shot out from before, suddenly thinking… If these plant faeries can respawn after death like regular monsters… Then, can him and Xiao Hui, unlimitedly farm Plant Faerie Stones here!! And then his max HP can increase unlimitedly…</p>
<p>Thinking here, Ling Chen’s heart beat started to quicken.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Here’s the chapter, and now I shall be on my little break. And thanks for the care, I feel all gooey and warm inside. Oh, and I love you guys too OhDine and anhrefn, no homo, unless your females, in that case pics or gtfo, jks… Remember folks, never send pics of yourself to strangers. And don’t post pics you wouldn’t want your parents to see online, you never know if that Johnny guy or Jennifer girl on your friends list is actually your parents in disguise…</p>
<p>Ideals are beautiful, but reality is… Ling Chen searched in the plant clusters for a long time but did not find any plant faeries again. Plant faeries are a couple of demonic spirits that developed intelligence relying on the power left behind by War God, they aren’t some sort of official monster. And their numbers are very few, the 5 Ling Chen killed were already all of them.</p>
<p>After searching around this massive garden for a period of time, Ling Chen did not find anything of value and finally moved his feet walking towards the exit. The true trial, should start after leaving this garden. He increasingly felt that this place is War God’s former residence 1000 years ago. Afterwards it was sealed with his strength before he died, becoming his place to test future generations.</p>
<p>Walking out of the garden, the gurgling sound of flowing water travelled into his ears. In front of him appeared a chasm about 50 meters wide, on top hung a 50 meter long, 4-5 meter wide bridge, underneath the bridge is the flowing river water. Everything here was close to the most pristine of nature, making people very easily get lost in this painting of nature and hard to connect this place with the dangerous trial ground. Ling Chen slowed his footsteps, walking forward one step at a time. When he was just about to step on the bridge, a series of barking sounds travelled over. Xiao Hui who was originally running behind him suddenly jumped to his front, blocking in front of him, arching its body and facing the direction of the bridge. Its eyes releasing a light of caution.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyebrows immediately furrowed. He bent his waist, picking up a stone beside his hand and throwing it onto the bridge.</p>
<p>Fwoosh…</p>
<p>Right at the instant the stone came in contact with the bridge, a white sword aura suddenly shot over from the chasm beneath, hitting the stone. Before the rolling stone could touch the bridge a second time it had already been destroyed into dust.</p>
<p>This bridge… is actually hiding a terrifying sword aura formation!! As long as one steps onto the bridge, large amounts of sword aura will shoot over making it impossible for people to guard against!</p>
<p>This bridge, is the first challenge of the trial? This is truly War God’’s trial, very scary.</p>
<p>How should I pass?</p>
<p>“Woof!!”</p>
<p>While he was focusing on the bridge, Xiao Hui seemed to have sensed his master’s quandary. With a light call it extended its right paw scratching Ling Chen’s the end of Ling Chen’s pants. After drawing over Ling Chen’s attention it jumped up on the spot once and then charged onto the bridge with a “Fwoosh”.</p>
<p>Fwoosh Fwoosh Fwoosh Fwoosh……….</p>
<p>Everything was like Ling Chen predicted. Where Xiao Hui reached a series of white sword aura would suddenly shoot to. The sword aura’s speed is extremely fast, like a series of white coloured shooting stars… But, Xiao Hui’s speed was even more shocking. Under its full on sprint Xiao Hui’s body brought up a grey shadow and swiftly charged through. All of the sword aura all struck the position that Xiao Hui had just stepped at an instant ago, all of the sword aura being thrown behind it, not a single one could touch its body. After a few seconds, Ling Chen still hadn’t completely reacted and Xiao Hui was already standing at the other side of the bridge, jumping up and down on the spot calling out to him… Very evidently, it wants him to copy the method that it used to charge over.</p>
<p>Ling Chen indeed wanted to directly charge over like it…</p>
<p>But the problem is… Xiao Hui’s movement speed is as high as 300! And his is only a little over 100! If he were to copy Xiao Hui and directly mindlessly charge over, he would be turned into a beehive the moment he stepped onto the bridge.</p>
<p>Standing at the edge of the bridge hesitating for a long time, Ling Chen still did not try crossing, and also could not go try. After a little while he lifted up his head looking left and right, suddenly seeing that not 100 meters to his right, there is another bridge. This bridge also connects both sides, but it looks a bit narrower.</p>
<p>With his movement speed, it is impossible to pass through the sword formation on the bridge. After thinking for a bit he moved his feet walking toward that bridge to the right.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui on the other side crooked its head in puzzlement. Looking at its master leave it then hurriedly charged over. In a short few seconds a grey shadow flitted by and Xiao Hui had already returned behind Ling Chen. Completely treating the sword formation like nothing. That comfortableness made Ling Chen’s teeth slightly itch looking at it.</p>
<p>Standing before the second bridge, Ling Chen just discovered that that this bridge is a lot narrower that that other bridge just before. Its width is only less than two meters and it is formed from wooden planks. The occasional light breeze that blew over made it shake, looking like it could snap at any moment.</p>
<p>Ling Chen picked up a rock testing the bridge. This bridge does not have a sword formation like the bridge before, but Ling Chen’s state of mind did not relax because of that. A bridge with a scary sword formation, a bridge without a sword formation… Maybe anybody would pick the one in front without a sword formation! This seems to be purposely guiding people to walk this bridge… Under this kind of situation, it’s very possible… On this bridge exists danger even greater than that other bridge.</p>
<p>Ling Chen became silent. After a long time he finally moved his feet, carefully stepping onto the bridge. Xiao Hui can easily pass that bridge’s sword formation, but I am unable to! Even if there could be even greater danger in front, I can only walk this path.</p>
<p>Creak!</p>
<p>Creak!</p>
<p>Creak……</p>
<p>His feet stepped on the bridge, bringing up the sound of the wood being tightened and potentially breaking at any moment. That sound made Ling Chen quite rattled. At the same time following him stepping on, the bridge also shook even more severely making it a bit difficult for him to control the balance of his body. Even Xiao Hui behind him also walked unsteadily.</p>
<p>“Woof!!”</p>
<p>Right when Ling Chen carefully walked to the center of the bridge, Xiao Hui’s shouting suddenly rose up from behind him. Ling Chen’s footsteps immediately stopped. Turning his body his eyes scanned the front and back of the bridge, his alertness rising to the highest. He already understood that when Xiao Hui released this kind of sound, it means that it has detected the approach of danger.</p>
<p>Poof…</p>
<p>Two white rays of light suddenly flashed at the two ends of the bridge at the same time and then rapidly set up two wide barriers, blocking off the front and back of the bridge.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>Two white barriers that fell from the sky sealed off his path of advance and retreat, locking him in on this incredibly unstable bridge that could snap at any moment. Ling Chen focused his eyes looking at those two big barriers, his eyebrows scrunching together… This bridge, sure enough isn’t that easy to pass… And, it is far less simple than just these two barriers.</p>
<p>After the barriers appeared, two virtually identical grey lights flashed in front of the barriers, and then forming to human figures covered in a faint grey glow.</p>
<p>[Sword God’s Page Boy · Sword]: Type: Undead, Level: LV15, Grade: Lord, HP: 15000. The sword page boy of War God’s page boys, has superb sword mastery. After death it carried a portion of Sword God’s will and power, becoming an undead that guards this place.</p>
<p>[Sword God’s Page Boy · Spear]: Type: Undead, Level: LV15, Grade: Lord, HP: 15000. The spear page boy of War God’s page boys, has superb spear mastery. After death it carried a portion of Sword God’s will and power, becoming an undead that guards this place.</p>
<p>The two undead page boys did not have any pauses after appearing, charging at him from two different directions. Right at this time, a screech travelled over to Ling Chen from above. Ling Chen rapidly lifted his head, seeing a massive green coloured bird that appeared at some unknown time, diving straight at him.</p>
<p>[Undeady Zephyr Bird]: Type: Undead, Level: LV15, Grade: Lord, HP: 12000. One of War God’s pets he raised when alive, has sharp eyes, an agile body and extremely strong dodge ability, can manipulate wind elements to attack. Even though it is in an undead state, its body seems to be harbouring a certain mysterious power War God left behind before leaving.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>Left, right, upwards… A whole 3 Lord grade bosses!!</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the strongest line-up Ling Chen has encountered besides the Greedy Giant Toad. Simultaneously facing 3 LV15 Lord bosses, and himself being on a dangerous bridge where he will fall down the chasm if he is not careful. This kind of environment, this kind of opponent… If it was another player here, they would probably choose to directly jump down from here.</p>
<p>With his current ability, there is no pressure facing one LV15 Lord boss, he can also cope with simultaneously facing 2. If it’s three, if he goes all out then it’s also entirely doable. But the pretense is under an ideal environment. In his current circumstance, even facing one LV15 Lord boss is still incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>He needs to quickly finish off one of them or else if he becomes surround from the left, right and above it will be too troublesome!</p>
<p>Rapidly making a decision in his head, Ling Chen steadied his body and then used his quickest speed to rush straight at the sword page boy.</p>
<p>“Fire of Rage!”</p>
<p>“Soul Sacrifice!”</p>
<p>Under this extremely dangerous situation encountering powerful enemies, he unhesitatingly used “Soul Sacrifice” the impasse skill that places him at the edge of death. He then lifted up Soaring Cloud, throwing it towards the sword page boy that is about to get close to him while running.</p>
<p>“Shooting Soaring Cloud!!”</p>
<p>Fwoosh!!!!</p>
<p>It has to be a critical hit!!</p>
<p>Like a silver shooting star Soaring Cloud shot over to the sword page boy in a whistling wind, piercing it from its chest and then flying out through its back, accurately sticking slantingly on a wooden plank.</p>
<p>-15000!</p>
<p>A 5-digit damage value flamboyantly floated up from the sword page boy’s head. The sword page boy’s running body immediately froze, and then weakly fell over… Death!!</p>
<p>This powerful LV15 Lord, was actually directly one-shotted by Shooting Soaring Cloud!</p>
<p>Under the state of Soul Sacrifice, Ling Chen’s attack strength is incredibly terrifying. But even if Shooting Soaring Cloud triggers a critical pierce under this state, it is still impossible for it to deal a damage over 10000… The reason it was able to, is because that damage number at the instant the sword page boy was killed, was black!</p>
<p>In Shooting Soaring Cloud’s skill effect, that 1% chance of triggering instant death!</p>
<p>For Ling Chen this was undoubtedly an unexpected great surprise, the initially three enemies became 2 in an instant. Even though it’s just one less, his pressure has decreased by multiple fold. Originally if he were to be caught in the middle, he would have no places to dodge. Now, the direction of the sword page boy has left him abundant movement space.</p>
<p>After the sword page boy fell, the spear page boy and the Undead Zephyr Bird had also already arrived. Ling Chen ignored them, using his fastest running speed charging straight to Soaring Cloud and then pulling it out from the wooden plank. With the current situation there is a very big risk using Soaring Cloud, because if he does not control well the landing point, Soaring Cloud will fall down the chasm below. Without Soaring Cloud, that will be the equivalent of him losing an arm, his strength will be greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Aaaaand, I’m back again. Sorry for the extended break without any announcement. I didn’t want to make another post saying no chapters and it was just a couple days so I thought it would be okay. And yes, Zuward, I am okay, thanks. The reason for the extra days of break is because if anybody has read that post by rwuxiaworld on reddit, I am currently in that digging holes stage. So I’ve also been using the break to try to adjust myself. So anyways, until school starts I shouldn’t be taking anymore breaks unless I really can’t do a chapter or don’t have the time, although that’s not really considered taking a break I think. Enjoy. Oh, and uh, I failed to take this into account when I chose to translate Shura’s Wrath but uh… I actually only read up to half way through before I actually quit reading because I lost interest, so… We’ll see. But I don’t finish 99% of the LNs/WNs I read so yeah…</p>
<p>After the sword page boy died, Xiao Hui happily ran over preparing to devour the corpse. But before he could start the sword page boy’s corpse gradually dissipated like an illusion, making Xiao Hui release a series of blue whimpers. In the first place the sword page boy was a dead undead, dying again it will directly dissipate. But when it dissipated, the silver sword in its hand and the golden bracers on its arms fell down. When Ling Chen took back Soaring Cloud he also used his fastest speed to pick them up. Without the time to look at their stats he directly threw them into his bag and then turned around, focusing his eyes on the Undead Zephyr Bird and spear page boy that had already come upon him.</p>
<p>The Undead Zephyr Bird’s speed was incredibly fast, when Ling Chen had just turned around it was only a distance of a few meters away from him. Soul Sacrifice’s effect had not disappeared, right now Ling Chen’s attack is explosively high but his HP is only 1. If he is just lightly touched once he will die… Under the effect of “Heaven’s Jealousy” if he dies, his level will directly drop to 0!</p>
<p>So no matter what he cannot allow himself to die!</p>
<p>Facing two Lord bosses in a 1 HP state and also in an extremely dangerous environment, even if its him he is also faced with extremely great pressure… But it is also only him that has the possibility to win!</p>
<p>His gaze tightly focusing on the Undead Zephyr Bird and spear page boy that approached at the same time, he silently calculated their distance. A long sharp cry rose up and the Undead Zephyr Bird’s diving speed suddenly increased, its sharp beak stabbing straight towards Ling Chen’s skull like a sharp bayonet. Ling Chen’s pupils widened, his body abruptly shifting to the side. He did not move towards the direction the sword page boy from before appeared but instead dodging in the direction of the approaching spear page boy… A howling wind swept by, narrowly flying past Ling Chen’s body the Undead Zephyr Bird hit the bridge causing it to sway wildly. If not that his balance was good enough, this swaying would have been enough to throw Ling Chen off the bridge. Ling Chen’s body lowered, his body as if nailed onto the bridge… He may have evaded the Undead Zephyr Bird’s diving attack, but his position after dodging placed him in the middle of the Undead Zephyr Bird and the spear page boy. A human and a beast attacking from two directions, he will have no place to run.</p>
<p>“Fwoosh!!”</p>
<p>Beside the ears of Ling Chen who had just avoided the Undead Zephyr Bird travelled over a slight piercing wind sound. The sound of wind rapidly closed in carrying a fatal sense of danger. Without even thinking he tightly held onto the bridge with one hand, his body suddenly lying down, his stomach tightly sticking to the surface of the bridge… Instantly, a silver light shot past over his back… That was the silver spear that the spear page boy threw! Spear throwing, this is one of the signature attack methods of spear type weapons!</p>
<p>Throwing out the spear, a flash of silver light and another identical spear had already reformed in the spear page boy’s hand. This scene made Ling Chen startled. Sure enough, in the next instant the spear page boy that got close stabbed towards him who was lying on top of the bridge.</p>
<p>With his current posture, dodging this rapid stab is extremely difficult. Ling Chen bit his teeth, using all of his strength to flip over, Soaring Cloud in his right hand rapidly whipping out. In his dim eyes flashed an extremely bright light for an instant.</p>
<p>Dang!!</p>
<p>That incredibly short, fleeting parrying judgement point triggering, the spear page boy’s spear struck Soaring Cloud, being firmly parried by Soaring Cloud. And it is also at this instant that the Undead Zephyr Bird’s second attack arrived from the other direction. A mass of deadly wind swirled around its body quickly forming.</p>
<p>Being caught in the middle, he did not have anywhere to retreat to. Ling Chen did not panic, in the first place dodging to the center of the two enemies was something that he deliberately did.</p>
<p>“Moon… Shadow!”</p>
<p>With a whisper, the black bracelet on Ling Chen’s right hand revealed its true Lunar Scourge appearance in an instant. A mass of strange light that you couldn’t say whether it was bright or dark shot out from Lunar Scourge. Under the light reflected the shadows of all of the surrounding objects and beings. And those shadows looked overly dim, like the shadows had been covered with another shadow.</p>
<p>The world, seemed to have completely frozen at this moment.</p>
<p>The bodies of the Undead Zephyr Bird and spear page boy all became unmoving. The swirling wind around the Undead Zephyr Bird’s body that was about to be complete dissipated on its own. Ling Chen jumped up from the ground, two “Full Power Strikes” smashing towards the Undead Zephyr Bird at the same time. With his current peak attack state, if these two attacks hit they will be able to get rid of a large chunk of the Undead Zephyr Bird’s life. The reason that he purposely moved to the middle of the two enemies just now was to make the effect of Moon Shadow able to simultaneously envelop the spear page boy and the Undead Zephyr Bird. Under the effect of Moon Shadow, their shadows along with their bodies will be forcibly frozen for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>5 seconds, is enough to determine victory!</p>
<p>Miss, Miss!</p>
<p>Two incredibly powerful attacks, hitting out two big “Misses”. Ling Chen was surprised for a moment, in his mind flashing by that “extremely high dodge ability” line in the Undead Zephyr Bird’s description. Making a prompt decision he immediately turned around, another two “Full Power Strikes” slashing towards the spear page boy.</p>
<p>-2328, Miss.</p>
<p>Even though the spear page boy is also a LV15 Lord, its dodge ability clearly cannot compare to the Undead Zephyr Bird’s. Ling Chen roughly estimated, his current hit rate for his attacks on the spear page boy should be 50% and above. He raised his arms again, his two arms using the quickest speed to release “Full Power Strike”, heavily cutting at its body. Under the status of Soul Sacrifice, as long as it hits it will deal a 4-digit damage for sure!</p>
<p>Miss, -2409, -4792, Miss, -2388, -4804!</p>
<p>Four rounds of attack, 8 Full Power Strikes under the Soul Sacrifice state, 5 hits, two criticals… At the instant that the last round of Full Power Strikes landed and the effect of Moon Shadow disappeared, the spear page boy’s HP was cleared by the second critical hit. Falling over while maintaining the previous stabbing position, its body disappeared leaving behind the silver spear in its hands and the silver robe on its body.</p>
<p>And at this time, the Undead Zephyr Bird had already regained freedom. Ling Chen’s pressure did not weaken at the slightest, because for him it is this big bird that is the greatest trouble. Soul Sacrifice’s effect still hadn’t ended… With his current vitality, under a full HP state he should be able to tank one attack from this Undead Zephyr Bird and not die, but under the current Soul Sacrifice state he will unquestionably die if he is swept by any random attack.</p>
<p>Chirp~~~ (TL: That’s right, that’s what mighty birds sound like. Jks aside, I honestly don’t know how to translate all this Chinese onomatopoeia so if it seems unfitting sometimes… yeah…)</p>
<p>In the long cry, the Undead Zephyr Bird had already returned to the air, circling above Ling Chen’s head. This kind of creature that can fly is undoubtedly what close combat professions don’t want to see the most. As long as they don’t fly down on their own, no matter how strong of an attack they possess they can only stare helplessly.</p>
<p>Ling Chen looked up partially, tightly grasping Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud he concentrated his focus, waiting for the chance when it dives down to attack.</p>
<p>Fwoosh!!</p>
<p>After circling around in the air four rounds the Undead Zephyr Bird finally abruptly dived down, swift like a preying eagle. Ling Chen’s eyes flashed, instantly determining its direction of diving and landing point, his legs applying force and then jumping backwards… Immediately, the Undead Zephyr Bird’s diving attack missed, hitting the bridge and causing the already crumbling bridge to shake wildly.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s feet staggered, he used his incredible balance to forcibly steady his body. In the process of steadying his body, he slashed out two Full Power Strikes.</p>
<p>Miss, Miss!</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>The Undead Zephyr Bird turned around on the bridge, with a cry its two wings started to rapidly flap, large amounts of wind element rapidly gathered with the flapping of wings. Its movements made Ling Chen bolt backwards without any thought.</p>
<p>Huu…</p>
<p>A horizontal swirl of wind swept forward from the Undead Zephyr Bird’s body, charging straight towards Ling Chen. Ling Chen’s speed quickened a bit more, rapidly sprinting until the front of the barrier at the end of the bridge before the wind swirl finally disappeared behind his back.</p>
<p>Still being able to maintain balance while sprinting so quickly on a softwood bridge, just this is enough to make people awed.</p>
<p>But the danger was not gone. After the wind swirl the Undead Zephyr Bird’s massive body was already sticking to the surface of the bridge and flying over to him at a low level. When its massive wings stretched, its entire body was wider than the bridge by one fold… Behind Ling Chen is the barrier that cannot be crossed, in front is the Undead Zephyr Bird’s body that is blocking all paths forward… This time, he’s truly been pushed into a corner, and his HP… is still only 1.</p>
<p>Do I have to use the Celestial Aqua Scale?</p>
<p>Ling Chen thought frowning, his body closely leaning against the barrier behind him. His right hand was also already grasping the Celestial Aqua Scale that can withstand 5 attacks. Under this kind of circumstance, if he wants to survive then there seems to only be using the Celestial Aqua Scale this one method, but he was also very unwilling. The trial has only just started, in front there are definitely even stronger enemies and greater dangers. If he used it right now… He won’t have anything to rely on later.</p>
<p>While his eyes flickered he suddenly glanced at his feet, his gaze immediately focusing.</p>
<p>Huu…</p>
<p>The Undead Zephyr Bird’s speed suddenly quickened, its body bringing up a series of wild howling wind charging towards Ling Chen who did not have any paths of retreat. Ling Chen’s eyes narrowed into two thin slits, right at the instant that he was about to be touched by the Undead Zephyr Bird, he suddenly let out a light shout, abruptly jumping to the right.</p>
<p>The Undead Zephyr Bird brutally missed, its body slamming into that white coloured barrer, and Ling Chen’s body also fell down in the sound of the wind… And then, one arm swiftly reaching out, he tightly grabbed onto the very edge of one of the planks, his entire body just hanging on the bridge like that. Afterwards he swung his body backwards, using the momentum and the plank as a leverage point to swing up high, his body drawing a large arc and then hopping onto the plank behind the Undead Zephyr Bird from beneath. After a short moment of fixing his body, he charged to the back of the Undead Zephyr Bird in the last few seconds before the effect of “Soul Sacrifice” disappeared, Full Power Strike heavily cutting down…</p>
<p>Miss, -2352, Miss, Miss.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s attack finally hit once. Just one time got rid of 20% of the Undead Zephyr Bird’s HP. The effect of Soul sacrifice also disappeared at this moment.After two rounds of attacks Ling Chen quickly retreated, at the same time as he was retreating he used a yellow potion pulling back his health, frowning as he stared at the Undead Zephyr Bird that had already turned around… The dodge ability of this LV15 Lord is honestly too terrifying. Against this kind of creature that has incredibly high dodge, elementalists that can ignore dodge ability have the easiest time. Archers and assassins that have strong hit ability also will not feel stumped… But for warriors and shield-guards that chase after attack and defence and have low hit ability, they are a nightmare-like existence.</p>
<p>Up to now, his dual two-handed weapons have in total attacked the Undead Zephyr Bird 8 times, but he has only hit once.</p>
<p>Can I only depend of Shooting Soaring Cloud to forcibly hit…</p>
<p>But, on this extremely unstable bridge, it is very likely to make Soaring Cloud fall down the chasm after throwing out Soaring Cloud… This is something that he is absolutely not willing to see.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I thought the title was a little too obvious so I changed it just a tiny, little bit. Just a little. Don’t worry, I’ll change it back to the original title tomorrow. </p>
<p>The Undead Zephyr Bird that Ling Chen had escaped from and then dealt a heavy blow from behind let out a long cry of anger. It did not rise up into the air but instead remained at a low altitude flying position, once again rapidly approaching Ling Chen while sticking close to the bridge… Its flying speed is at least double of Ling Chen’s movement speed, in the blink of an eye it had already closed in to the front of Ling Chen. It flapped its wings, a swirl of wind sweeping forward…</p>
<p>The wind swirl is a short distance away and behind him he is only a couple of meters away from the barrier. Even if he can surpass his movement speed and move to the very back he will not be able to escape this wind swirl attack. If he evades to the side he will fall down the chasm for sure. While his thoughts were rapidly turning, he did not move, stiffening his body allowing the wind swirl to hit his body.</p>
<p>Huu…</p>
<p>-263!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s HP instantly dropped over half, but compared to the damage received the impact brought by the wind swirl was even more scarier. It made Ling Chen’s body continuously move back, making him almost lose his balance on the shaking wood plank bridge and fall off… And as long as he falls, even if he doesn’t drop off, an attack from the Undead Zephyr Bird charging over will be enough for him to directly die. But Ling Chen’s balance can be said to be matchless, his feet continuously stumbled but he just did not fall. After moving back 5 steps his two feet like being nailed to the bridge locked down his body, at the same time he swallowed a yellow potion returning his HP to max… As he predicted, right when his body stopped the Undead Zephyr Bird’s body had already charged over. If he had steadied his body a second later he would definitely have been heavily hit by this attack.</p>
<p>With the same method of dodging as when he was forced into a corner before, Ling Chen directly jumped off from the bridge and then accurately grabbed the edge of a wood plank. Afterwards using the momentum from jumping to suddenly swing forward, throwing himself a distance of two over meters in a horizontal direction and directly flipping back onto the bridge landing behind the Undead Zephyr Bird. He then quickly pounced forward, two “Full Power Strikes” heavily slashing down.</p>
<p>Miss, Miss!</p>
<p>Ling Chen was dazed for a moment, he did not retreat before the Undead Zephyr Bird turned around but instead cut over with another two “Full Power Strikes” unwilling to give up.</p>
<p>Miss, -552.</p>
<p>The second round of attacks finally hit once. The Undead Zephyr Bird’s HP once again dropped a chunk. At the same time, the Undead Zephyr Bird had also already turned around, flapping its wings a horizontal wind swirl charged over. Ling Chen was too close and couldn’t escape the speed of wind to begin with. He was hit by the wind swirl at close range, his body being directly brought up and swept flying backwards.</p>
<p>-270!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s HP once again dropped over half. Luckily the Undead Zephyr Bird’s wind swirl blows away in a linear line. Ling Chen’s landing point after being blown away is still on top of the bridge. When he landed his two hands tightly grabbed the bridge steadying his body. He then jumped away, using his fastest speed to escape backwards and evading the Undead Zephyr Bird’s follow-up low altitude charge…Before he was in a rush to attack and almost died. After the close run he instead gradually calmed down while staring at the approaching Undead Zephyr Bird.</p>
<p>Attacking after the short opening the Undead Zephyr Bird reveals after attacking is not only very dangerous, but because of its overly monstrous dodge ability, his attack efficiency is extremely low and requires an average of 7-8 hits to have a possibility of hitting once. His points have all been added into strength, not a single point went to agility. Like this even though he has extreme attack ability, his hit ability will be relatively low. All of his hit ability right now is based off of the hit attribute of his equipment. Without the hit attribute added by the equipment, the chances of his regular attacks hitting the Undead Zephyr Bird are near 0.</p>
<p>Even so… Ling Chen put away Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud, his gaze stilling, focusing all of his attention on the Undead Zephyr Bird’s movements. He gave up attacking and started to prepare to only dodge. At the same time… Waiting for the cooldown times for Shooting Soaring Cloud, Soul Sacrifice and Moon Shadow to end. Shooting Soaring Cloud’s cooldown time is 100 seconds, after upgrading to LV3 Soul Sacrifice’s cooldown time dropped to 200 seconds, Moon Shadow’s cooldown time is only 60 seconds. Against this Undead Zephyr Bird, his most efficient attack is Shooting Soaring Cloud that has the absolute hit attribute. His even more efficient attack is Shooting Soaring Cloud under the stacked effects of Soul Sacrifice and Fire of Rage. One time is enough to eliminate over ⅓ of the Undead Zephyr Bird’s HP. If a critical appears, it will directly put it in a critical condition… If a critical pierce appears, it can very likely one-shot the current Undead Zephyr Bird!</p>
<p>If it was in a regular environment it would be a lot easier for him to deal with this Undead Zephyr Bird. He could even circle around its body and do high risk attacks that also have the highest efficiency of controlling it. For him being able to insta-kill his opponents and not being able to are two completely different concepts. But on this soft bridge he is in terrible danger for every single second, and he also needs to focus all of his attention every second.</p>
<p>If he gives up attacking and only dodges, then even if it’s under a near death circumstance there are few people that can easily take his life. The Undead Zephyr Bird has a total of three attack methods, dive attack, body charge and horizontal wind swirl. It can fly freely but Ling Chen is on a crumbling wood plank bridge. If regular players were in this kind of situation it would be entirely the same as being in an entirely hopeless impossible situation.</p>
<p>Yet, right on this shaking wood plank bridge, Ling Chen’s body started to dance between the green shadow brought up by the Undead Zephyr Bird’s or flying or attacking body. At times he would rapidly charge through the space underneath the Undead Zephyr Bird’s body. When he is forced into a corner he will choose to swing past from beneath the bridge. At times when he honestly cannot dodge, he will choose to be purposely hit and then find the fleeting opening when he is hit… On this dangerous wood plank bridge his every movement was extremely dangerous, absolutely not something a regular person could do. Even if a person had the ability to do so, with just the slightest mistake they will screw up and fall down. Almost 3 minutes passed by, the wood plank bridge shook for a countless number of times, he also didn’t know how many alarmingly dangerous actions he’s done. But he has not messed up a single time, he has not been killed by the Undead Zephyr Bird and he has not fallen from the bridge.</p>
<p>Even the LV10 Celestial boss the Greedy Giant Toad did not make him die, how can he be willing to die under the claws of this LV15 Lord!</p>
<p>And the cooldown time of Soul Sacrifice that he was waiting for has finally reached zero.</p>
<p>“Excellent!!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen muttered in his heart. He stopped his body and focused on the Undead Zephyr Bird who was charging over at a low altitude. He did not dodge, instead casually lifting up his right arm…</p>
<p>“Moon Shadow!”</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge’s true appearance once again appeared. Under the strange light it released a long shadow appeared behind the Undead Zephyr Bird, it then froze together with its body in mid-air. With statuses like stunned, petrified and frozen these kinds of effects that restrict movement, targets in the air will all fall down from the air after being affected with these statuses. But Moon Shadow’s effect is like stopping time, once the shadow has been frozen the respective body will also be completely frozen. Before the effect disappears it will maintain its condition before being frozen, there will not be any changes.</p>
<p>“Fire of Rage”, “Soul Sacrifice”.</p>
<p>His two strongest attack buffs simultaneously being added, Ling Chen’s attack ability once again exploded to his peak state. He raised Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud at the same time, his two hands swinging Full Power Strike together cutting towards the Undead Zephyr Bird’s unmoving body.</p>
<p>Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, -2384, Miss, Miss, -4780!</p>
<p>8 Full Power Strikes, two hits, one critical. When the last critical damage appeared a light smile appeared at the corners of Ling Chen’s lips… Because in his eyes the Undead Zephyr Bird right now is a dead bird.</p>
<p>“Die… Shooting Soaring Cloud!!”</p>
<p>His right hand raising up and throwing out a silver shooting star. Under the absolute hit effect of Shooting Soaring Cloud, this attack will unquestionably clear the Undead Zephyr Bird’s remaining HP.</p>
<p>-4766!</p>
<p>Soaring Cloud pierced through the Undead Zephyr Bird’s body, Under Ling Chen’s precise calculations it stuck into a wood plank on an angle, not falling down the chasm. Without the chance to move the health bar of the Undead Zephyr Bird that had just escaped from the effect of Moon Shadow had already become completely empty. With a long cry of despair the cinereous coloured body weakly fell over in the floating grey light, becoming completely silent.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully killed LV15 Lord BOSS ‘War God’s Page Boy · Sword’, ‘War God’s Page Boy · Spear’, ‘Undead Zephyr Bird’, Fame+4520, SP+450.”</p>
<p>Looking at the fallen Undead Zephyr Bird Ling Chen finally let out a long sigh of relief and lifted up his hand wiping the cold sweat on his forehead. He then quickly walked forward, first picking up his Soaring Cloud.</p>
<p>The body the Undead Zephyr Bird left behind after dying did not rapidly dissipate like the two undead page boys before and it continuously remained there. This made Ling Chen puzzled for a moment, put he did not put it in his heart. Putting away Soaring Cloud and Sand Blade he walked over to the side of the Undead Zephyr Bird’s corpse, picking up the items it dropped.</p>
<p>The Undead Zephyr Bird dropped 3 yellow potions along with a bow surrounded by a weak green glow. Holding the bow in his hands a very refreshing feeling faintly traveled over, without doubt this bow is definitely not an ordinary item. He held the bow in front of him preparing to look at its stats. Suddenly, that magnified shout of Xiao Hui’s rose up beside his ears…</p>
<p>“Bark!”</p>
<p>“Bark!!!!”</p>
<p>The sound of Xiao Hui’s shouts made Ling Chen suddenly dazed. This is the warning cry that it released when it senses the approach of danger. Moreover this time it is clearly a lot more heavier than the previous few times! Ling Chem immediately lifted his head looking around the surroundings in vigilance. He suddenly noticed that he had already killed the 3 Lord bosses that appeared but the white barrier at the two sides of the bridge still hadn’t vanished.</p>
<p>Could it be that there are still other even stronger creatures that will appear on this bridge?!</p>
<p>While Ling Chen was alarmed Xiao Hui suddenly pounced over biting his pant leg, using all of its strength to drag him to the side. A thought appeared in Ling Chen’s heart, he unhesitatingly moved his feet and bolted towards the location Xiao Xui was dragging towards. He had just moved a distance of not even 5 steps when at the place he was standing before, the corpse of the Undead Zephyr Bird suddenly flashed a mass of green light.</p>
<p>That… What is that!?</p>
<p>Chirp~~~~</p>
<p>The sound of an incredibly resonant long cry pierced through the skies and shook Ling Chen’s eardrums. In the green light the Undead Zephyr Bird that was originally already dead suddenly stood up and then flapped its wings. It flew towards the sky and continuously circled in the air three times. When its body stopped, a pair of incredibly sharp green coloured eyes locked onto his body… Accompanied by a massive aura of oppression.</p>
<p>An aura of oppression that was clearly far greater than before… and a dangerous aura of near hopelessness.</p>
<p>[Revived Zephyr Bird]: Type Beast, Grade: Celestial, Level: LV15, HP: 180000. One of War God’s pets that followed him in his life. Originally in an undead state, now revived by the mysterious power left behind by War God. Its strength has also recovered to its original height. Has an agile body, extremely high dodge ability and strong wind element control ability.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The dead Undead Zephyr Bird revived… But this was not enough to make Ling Chen shocked. What made him almost lose control is that the Zephyr Bird after revival…</p>
<p>Is actually Celestial grade!!</p>
<p>The information of the [Revived Zephyr Bird] that appeared in his head and the powerful pressure from the newborn Zephyr Bird along with the scent of death that he could already clearly smell all told Ling Chen… This was all real.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance the newborn Zephyr Bird did not have any changes, but its colour is a bit different. The originally greyish-green colour covered by an aura of death has now become a pure green colour, it no longer had the colour of death. Right now it is hovering above Ling Chen, a pair of green eyes looking down upon him, looking with disdain at the human standing on the wood plank bridge. The Zephyr Bird right now indeed does have the qualifications to look down on this human.</p>
<p>No wonder all of the geniuses that came here before all died here. War God’s trial is actually this terrifying. Just simultaneously facing 3 Lord bosses is already hard enough, and a shaking wood plank bridge made this difficulty increase by dozens of fold. The main reason Ling Chen could eliminate the 3 Lords before is because he fortunately one-shotted the first undead page boy. The other key to victory is that his [Soul Sacrifice] made him possess terrifying attack strength under a LV10 state that regular LV40 players might not even be able to reach. Despite this, he was still surrounded by danger when facing the previous Undead Zephyr Bird.</p>
<p>Right now, in front of him is actually a LV15 Celestial beast!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s feelings right now were even greater than when he faced his first Celestial beast the Greedy Giant Toad!</p>
<p>“That War God… Is it that he just purely doesn’t want people to pass this trial!!” Ling Chen grinded his teeth thinking. The primary condition to enter this trial is level below LV15… Beating a LV15 Celestial boss while LV15 or lower, even more terrible is that it is on a dangerous bridge… Even even more excessive is… This beast can also fly!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen really had a strong impulse to curse.</p>
<p>Even though his is filled with emotion, he still used the quickest speed to forcibly calm down. He then took out from his inventory the scan scroll that the guardian of the Hall of Heroic Souls gifted him and crushed it facing the Revived Zephyr Bird. (TL: In novels I always read that the way to use scrolls is to crush them, I don’t know if that’s actually right or if that’s just how they say using it.)</p>
<p>The Revived Zephyr Bird’s complete information immediately appeared in his head.</p>
<p>[Revived Zephyr Bird]: Type Beast, Grade: Celestial, Level: LV15, HP: 180000. One of War God’s pets that followed him in his life. Originally a regular bamboo bird, afterwards it gained powerful strength and intellect by the influence of War God’s power. Has an agile body, extremely high dodge ability and strong wind element control ability. After War God died, it followed War God’s will remaining in War God’s trial ground, becoming a trial beast.</p>
<p>Innate Attributes: Wind element resistance 60%, Immunity to poison, sleep, confusion, instant-death, very fast flying speed, extremely high dodge ability, recovers 100HP/s.</p>
<p>Attack Methods:</p>
<p>[Mid-Air Charge]: Suddenly charging down from high in the air with its body, using the momentum to cause a strong collision with the target. When it collides its body will bring up a strong gale making the targets in front in a large area lose balance and even be blown away. Before activating body will pause for a short moment and retreat. Frequency: High.</p>
<p>[Cold Wind Fang]: Flapping its two wings bringing up a violent wind that attacks all targets in a frontal area of 20 x 10. The swift wind blades are enough to easily cut apart the bodies of creatures. Seamless attack, before activating the two wings will continuously flap 3 times to gather wind element. Frequency: Average. (TL: I’m not sure of a good translation for the seamless attack, basically it means there are no gaps so if you get caught in it you can’t dodge, suggestions welcomed.)</p>
<p>[Frenzied Wind]: Rapidly circling in the air creating a massive wind vortex that engulfs the surrounding 30 meters around it. Can use the wind vortex to fling out all targets within range and can sweep all targets within range right beneath its body. No damage, after being swept 100% chance of falling into at least 5 seconds of [Dazed]. Frequency: Kinda Low.</p>
<p>[Piercing Cry]: Extends its neck and releases a long cry, using the sound of the extremely sharp chirp to stimulate the minds of all targets in a 30 meter radius around it. No damage, 100% chance of all targets to fall into at least 5 seconds of [Confusion]. Frequency: Low.</p>
<p>[Nightmare Whirlwind]: Wind elemental destruction skill, releases all of its wind elemental power, causing all of the wind element within a 50 meter radius of itself to become chaotic, bringing up countless disastrous wind blades cutting all targets within range. There is no space to dodge within the enveloped area. After releasing it dodge ability will drop to 0 for 10 minutes and cannot use wind element power within 30 seconds. Frequency: Immediately activates when HP is lower than 10%, can use once a day.</p>
<p>Weakness: Defense is lower, afraid of lightning attacks, cannot swim.</p>
<p>The stats of the revived Zephyr Bird made Ling Chen heavily swallow his spit. This Zephyr Bird’s level is 5 levels higher than the Greed Giant Toad’s, but its overall strength is many times greater than the Greedy Giant Toad’s. At least, the Greedy Giant Toad may have been strong, but besides its final destruction skill it had a set attack routine and attack spaces. But this Zephyr Bird, its [Cold Wind Fang] is a large area seamless attack. Enveloping the frontal 20 x 10 area with a flap of its wings. To escape this range before it can finish flapping its wings three time is unbelievably difficult… And on this soft bridge it is simply impossible. This is also just its skill listed at number 2, the following skills are even more scarier to the point that people are unable but to tremble in fear.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Zephyr Bird’s description and innate attributes highlighted that its dodge ability is extremely high… As a Lord grade, the Undead Zephyr Bird’s dodge ability already made 7-8 of Ling Chen’s attack hit an average of just once. With the current Celestial Grade, Ling Chen had reason to believe that the hit rate of his attack towards it is 0! But if it was just this then it wouldn’t be completely hopeless because he has the absolute hit skill “Shooting Soaring Cloud”! Under his best state this attack can also heavily damage it, but… This Zephyr Bird also has an innate attribute of automatically recovering 100 HP per second!!</p>
<p>Under the effect of Soul Sacrifice and Fire of Rage, if Shooting Soaring Cloud very luckily triggers critical and pierce, it can deal around 10 thousand damage. Compared to this damage, the damage dealt by Shooting Soaring Cloud not under the effect of Soul Sacrifice is basically negligible. Souls Sacrifice’s cooldown time is 200 seconds… But 200 seconds, is enough for the Zephyr Bird to recover 20 thousand points of HP!</p>
<p>Even under the most idealistic, most perfect condition, all damage dealt towards the Zephyr Bird is simply inferior to its automatic recovery.</p>
<p>After looking at the Zephyr Bird’s complete stats, Ling Chen only used 3 seconds and gained a conclusion: His chances of beating it are… 0!</p>
<p>Following the appearance of the revived Zephyr Bird in the air, the surrounding air-flow all became disorderly. Ling Chen took a very deep breath, his two hands tightly grasped together… Above is a Celestial beast, below is the chasm with the rushing river water. This is the War God’s trial, the trial that once made 6 geniuses lose their lives… The hopeless trial that makes people unable to see any hope!</p>
<p>Xiao Hui quickly ran towards Ling Chen’s side, its head lifting up high and releasing whimpering sounds from its mouth. Clearly, it sensed its masters situation and mood, knowing that against this powerful green bird, its master simply cannot win.</p>
<p>Chirp~~~~~~~</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s silence did not last for too long. It finally let out a long cry, its body slightly retreating and then suddenly charging towards Ling Chen. Where it went its body brought up a mass of rapid violent wind.</p>
<p>Before the Zephyr Bird even reached him that rapid wind made Ling Chen’s face faintly hurt. Following the approach of the Zephyr Bird, the wind also became increasingly stronger. His body could no longer keep control, stumbling backwards and then being directly lifted up by the wind and being uncontrollably blown away… Flying all the way out of the bridges area…</p>
<p>Crap!!</p>
<p>Of course Ling Chen would not have the ability to fly. His body that was blown away could not be controlled, only able to helplessly float away. The Zephyr Bird’s mid-air charge also shot over like a green arrow, ramming straight towards his body… A LV15 Celestial, one-shotting him is simply easy as pie!</p>
<p>This kind of ramming speed, even if his body was under his control it would still be very hard to dodge, not to mention in the air. Ling Chen widened his eyes and then abruptly extended his arm, placing in front the [Celestial Aqua Scale] the guardian of the Hall of Heroic Souls gave him… Even if he cannot win, he is absolutely not willing to easily die under its claws. This Celestial Aqua Scale than can withstand 5 melee attacks is the only thing that can save him right now.</p>
<p>Bam!!</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s body rammed into the Celestial Aqua Scale, yet it released the sound of metal hitting metal. Under the massive force of impact Ling Chen immediately hurtled downwards, but there was no damage number that floated up from his body. And the Zephyr Bird, it was also bounced faraway by the rebound of the Celestial Aqua Scale. For a short period of time it won’t be able to attack Ling Chen a second time.</p>
<p>“Woof!!” Xiao Hui that was still standing on the bridge let out a whimper, watching its master who was falling down the chasm it also jumped down following its master without any fear.</p>
<p>Beside his ears was the sound of the howling wind that passed by him. Ling Chen knows that he is currently falling, falling into the abyss of death. Entering Mystic Moon for only a couple of days, he’d already encountered 2 Celestial beasts. The first Greedy Giant Toad was finally defeated by him after dancing around the edge of death countless times. But this time, against the Zephyr Bird, against its extremely high dodge ability and HP recovery ability, he simply couldn’t find any possibility and hope of defeating it.</p>
<p>This trial, am I going to be like all of the people that entered here before and end in failure?</p>
<p>Maybe that person was right, me choosing this trial really was biting off more than I can chew.</p>
<p>Following his falling down, the sound of rushing water became closer and closer. He difficulty turned his head looking downward, what he saw was the already afoot flowing sleep. (TL: I have no clue what he means by flowing sleep. Could be that the flowing river water will cause him to fall asleep (death) or my raw is wrong.)</p>
<p>Plop…</p>
<p>-292!</p>
<p>Falling down from such a high place, if he had hit the solid ground Ling Chen would certainly have died. But because it was water, even though he still lost over half of his health the instant that he hit the surface, fortunately he did not die. After Ling Chen’s body sank below the water about 10 meters due to inertia, he finally retrieved control over his body. At the first moment he took a yellow potion restoring his HP to max, he then quickly turned around making himself float on the surface of the water. At the same time another “Plop” sound travelled over to his ears. It was Xiao Hui that landed beside him and then swam over with a “Fwoosh”. (TL: Yes, in reality he would have been turned into a pancake, but such is the way of fiction.)</p>
<p>Xiao Hui can freely move in water, its speed is not that slightest bit slower compared to on land.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Sigh, sorry guys, I know I said no breaks anymore but I’m not digging holes anymore, I’ve hit rock bottom. I don’t know, I think it’s just Shura’s Wrath that I’ve lost interest in translating. I don’t know, maybe it’s time to choose another main project. Anyways, I’ll do my best to keep trucking on. If there’s no update at the appointed release time then you guys can stop checking for the day. I’ll do my best to make sure I don’t take such long breaks anymore but the digging is real. On the other hand, here’s a Chinese poem I found that will teach you guys the meaning of life and maybe help you guys attain the Zen state which will help ease your needs. How much you understand depends on your comprehension young grasshoppers. The “poor” used here is not the no money poor but the “you poor boy” kind of poor. Ahem…</p>
<p>The white clouds in the sky are so white, the me on the ground is so poor;</p>
<p>Honestly, really really white, honestly, really really poor;</p>
<p>Very white, very poor, very very white, very very poor;</p>
<p>Extremely white, extremely poor;</p>
<p>Damn white, damn poor;</p>
<p>Virtually too damned white, virtually too damned poor</p>
<p>Sigh—</p>
<p>“Xiao Hui!”</p>
<p>Looking at Xiao Hui that swiftly swam over to his side, Ling Chen shook off the water droplets on his face and suddenly had a very unfamiliar, very complex and hard to describe feeling in his heart. Even though he is just 22 years of age this year, but the storms that he has weathered in his life are honestly too many. To the point that regular people cannot even imagine. And the countless life and death situations, the countless plights that he’s faced all these years have always been faced by him alone, borne by him alone, biting the bullet alone…Regardless if it’s in the real world or in the game world. Right now under this hopeless situation, this little creature that just started following him followed him jumping down and swam to his side. He who has never had a companion watched as Xiao Hui swam closer, he suddenly had a feeling of no longer being alone, a feeling of being able to have something to rely on in this hopeless situation… And this feeling seemed to be fairly nice.</p>
<p>Chirp~~~</p>
<p>A severe sense of danger travelled from above. He may have fallen down the chasm, but the Zephyr Bird dived down chasing after him as if knowing that he hadn’t died. It charged straight towards him, carrying a violent wind and arriving above his head in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>In the water the body’s movement ability is greatly inferior to on land. The massive bird body rapidly enlarged in his eyes. He didn’t have the time to think, using his quickest speed to raise up the Celestial Aqua Scale in his hand…</p>
<p>Bam!</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s attack once again landed on the Celestial Aqua Scale. In the sound of collision its body was bounced far away like before, Ling Chen’s body was also heavily rammed under the water under the force of impact.</p>
<p>-43, -43, -43…</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body sank in the water, above his head a red number would float up every second. Following his sinking Xiao Hui also dived below into the water. After drawing out a beautiful water trail it had already charged over to Ling Chen’s body, using its petite little body to support underneath Ling Chen, seemingly wanting to stop his body’s descent.</p>
<p>Ling Chen bit his teeth looking upward. Through the clear water he could very clearly see the situation above. He saw that the Zephyr Bird was circling in the air above, but it did not charge down.</p>
<p>That’s right, in the Zephyr Bird’s weaknesses one is it cannot swim! Which also means that if I can dive under the water, it will be unable to attack me!</p>
<p>Thinking here he became slightly spirited, faintly seeing a ray of hope… Of course, this is absolutely not the hope of defeating the Zephyr Bird, but the hope of escaping from its claws. If he dies, his level will directly return to zero. Even if he cannot defeat the Zephyr Bird, he will absolutely not allow himself to die under its claws.</p>
<p>His body difficulty maintained balance in the water. He put away his weapons, his two hands repelling the water and swimming following the flow of the water. At the same time he silently looked at his decreasing health value.</p>
<p>In the support skills of players one of them is “Swimming”. After learning swimming one is able to have a certain degree of mobility in water. The higher the level, the greater the degree of freedom in water. At the same time, one is also able to use different kinds of recovery potions in water. But if one does not have this skill, then even though one is able to achieve movement in water by moving their limbs, if one’s body is completely submerged for over 5 seconds then HP will continuously drop. In shallow water HP drops 10% every second. The deeper one goes, the greater the HP lost. Moreover, without the swimming skill, any health recovery potion used in water is ineffective!</p>
<p>Right now Ling Chen’s HP is dropping at a speed of 10% per second. In 15 seconds of time he will completely die… That is to say, Ling Chen can at most only stay in the water for 14 seconds, then he has to stick his head out of the water to recover HP and breathe. (TL: Um, I don’t know how the math works, maybe there’s some kind of special skill I’m forgetting. Anyways I know I translated that right so don’t ask me. Automatic HP recovery?)</p>
<p>The flowing speed of the chasm’s water is not fast, Ling Chen paid attention to his lowering HP while turning his head and looking at the position of the Zephyr Bird in the air. Under the water he can clearly see everything above the water, but in the air it is difficult to see anything slightly deeper in the water. So even though he is following the flow of the water underneath, the Zephyr Bird is still circling about in the same spot. Ling Chen silently prayed that after a dozen seconds he will already have been brought by the water to a location outside of the Zephyr Bird’s detection range. And then after he takes a breath he’ll be able to swim even further following the water making it hard for the Zephyr Bird to find him again.</p>
<p>10 seconds… 11 seconds… 12 seconds…</p>
<p>Ling Chen suddenly held his breath, his body doing its best to move upwards and then coming out of the water with a “Pop”. He took large gasps of air, at the same time not forgetting to rapidly drink down a yellow potion returning his HP to max. Before he dived under the water again he lifted his head looking in the direction of the Zephyr Bird and discovering that the Zephyr Bird was actually flying in this direction. He was actually still unable to escape from the Zephyr Bird’s senses!</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body dived into the water like a bolt of lightning. Above his head the Zephyr Bird’s massive shadow touched the surface of the water and then stuck close to the surface of the water drawing out an inverse parabola flying back into the air.</p>
<p>It is unwilling to enter the water. Ling Chen who was in the water silently thought, but suddenly his eyes sank, his body rapidly moving making his body exert itself to go deeper… Because through the water he saw the Zephyr Bird’s body facing the water and rapidly flapping its wings.</p>
<p>Huu…</p>
<p>A wild wind storm formed, howling and flying towards the area that Ling Chen appeared before… The Zephyr Bird’s AOE wind attack skill — Cold Wind Fang!</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances this Cold Wind Fang can instantly envelop the frontal 20 meter area and a 10 meter area to the sides. But when this wind storm hit the surface of the water Ling Chen secretly let out a sigh of relief in his heart, because after penetrating to 2 meters deep below the water it had already completely disappeared, being completely dispersed by the water.</p>
<p>In other words, as long as he is over two meters deep in the water, Cold Wind Fang cannot harm him.</p>
<p>But even so… following the flow of the water for a dozen seconds and still being instantly targeted by the Zephyr Bird. How should he escape from the Zephyr Bird’s sight?</p>
<p>Looks like I can only continue following the water down and look for other chances like a waterfall or the like.</p>
<p>The thought appearing in his mind he held his breath, his body continuing to move following the water.</p>
<p>If it was someone else, under this kind of situation where it is impossible to have any results most people will directly choose to give up, not wasting anymore time and undergoing this torture. But Ling Chen… The life and death situations that he’s experienced this life are honestly too many, the grim reaper has waved its hand toward towards him a countless number of times. But the results are all him defeating the grim reaper… Unless he truly wishes to die, or else, no matter what he faces, no matter what circumstances he encounters, he will not give up. He will use all of his strength to fight until he no longer has any strength. Just like what he believed in before… In his life there has never been the words “give up”! Not before, and especially not later!</p>
<p>After 13 seconds he once again came up from the water to breath. When his HP had just recovered to max danger once again approached. The Zephyr Bird that had been left behind about 100 or so meters spread its wings like before and flew over. A distance of 100 meters was closed in by it in the blink of an eye under the flapping of its massive wings. Ling Chen silently sighed, taking a deep breath and then diving into the water leaving the Zephyr Bird out of options again.</p>
<p>The length of this river flowing in the mountains is unknown and where it flows to is also unknown… When Ling Chen came out of the water to breathe for the 10th time, he even didn’t know if this place still belonged in the area of War God’s trial grounds, or if other creatures or dangers would appear in front. But to survive he could only continue following the river down, time after time helplessly repeating the same actions, following the flow of the river further and further…</p>
<p>But the surrounding scenery seemed to not have had any changes. The Zephyr Bird also never lost its target.</p>
<p>After the 20th time that it charged at Ling Chen who came out of the water to breathe and missed, the Zephyr Bird finally exploded.</p>
<p>Chirp~~~~</p>
<p>This cry was longer and louder than any of the other ones before. Ling Chen who was in the water lifted his head looking towards the sky. He saw the Zephyr Bird’s body wrapped in a dark green light, rapidly circling in the air following a fixed ring orbit and becoming faster and faster… In the end, it actually brought up a dark green coloured ring, like there were countless Zephyr Bird flying in the air.</p>
<p>Huu…</p>
<p>An extremely violent wind was brought up. The wind carried up the air, and then the water, and then Ling Chen who was below the water… All being drawn into the wind.</p>
<p>Crap!!</p>
<p>Frenzied Wind… Two words flashed across in Ling Chen’s mind.</p>
<p>Ling Chen was silently shocked in his heart. But the torrent brought up by the fierce wind was something that he simply couldn’t oppose. He followed the large amounts of river water being brought up bit by bit by the spinning gale, being brought out of the water. His body was also being drawn towards the center of the storm in a dizzying spin. When the wind storm stopped he had already been highly thrown up into the air, and then free falling back down in the air…</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s circling body stopped and then with a sharp cry charged straight towards Ling Chen who was in the air.</p>
<p>Frenzied Wind may not deal any damage, but once entangled one will fall into a dazed status for at least 5 seconds. Right now the mind of Ling Chen who is falling down unmoving is a big blank.</p>
<p>Following his descent the Zephyr Bird also came closer and closer. Right when its attack was about to land on Ling Chen’s body, Ling Chen’s eyes suddenly recovered clarity. Virtually without the need for his brain to react his right hand extended forward using an unimaginable speed, the Celestial Aqua Scale blocking in front…</p>
<p>Right now it has only been not even 3 seconds from when Ling Chen suffered from the dazed status.</p>
<p>Bam!!</p>
<p>If the Zephyr Bird had used Cold Wind Fang and not Mid-Air Charge Ling Chen would have died without any question. Because the Celestial Aqua Scale can only withstand melee attacks, but the Zephyr Bird also couldn’t have thought that Ling Chen could actually recover so quickly from the dazed status.</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s attack was once again offset by the Celestial Aqua Scale. In the force of impact Ling Chen fell into the water, becoming safe again.</p>
<p>Dazed, confusion, sleep… These kinds of negative effects are all triggered by the system stimulating the mind and thus creating the respective effect. But when the strength of a person’s mind reaches a certain level, then even the mental stimulation given by the system will be greatly offset. Under Ling Chen’s powerful mental strength, Frenzied Wind’s dazed effect only lasted on his body for 2 seconds of time.</p>
<p>But this time was also enough to make Ling Chen covered in cold sweat, the Celestial Aqua Scale in his hand also only remained the last two chances.</p>
<p>Exactly will there be the existence of a turning point… If yes, exactly where is it!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So about people wondering about the time limit, if you go back to the chapter the only thing said is that he will be sent out after a sufficient amount of time. So I guess the time limit is sufficient enough for him to waste all this time. And for people wondering why he doesn’t use Moon Shadow, I don’t know, maybe you can’t use skills in water either without the swimming skill, or else he could easily get away after using Moon Shadow a couple of times.</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s Frenzied Wind still did not kill Ling Chen, its mood became completely violent. After stopping its body that was bounced away by the Celestial Aqua Scale it suddenly let out an incredibly sharp cry…</p>
<p>When the sound of the cry rose up, the entire body of Ling Chen who was under the water suddenly jolted, his eardrums were also virtually about to burst. He was instantly alert and then he immediately stopped his swimming actions, preparing Mind Saber in his hands.</p>
<p>Chirp~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>A long cry that created waves of ripples even in the depths of the water. Ling Chen’s body stiffened, he was instantly deprived of his awareness but then at the same time, Mind Saber in his hand flashed a white light for an instant, the confused feeling in Ling Chen’s head vanished entirely. He focused his mind, putting away Mind Saber and following the flow of the water continuing to swim forward. Before when he was facing the Greedy Giant Toad Mind Saber played a huge role, helping Ling Chen become immune to its large area confusion skill. The Zephyr Bird also has a large area skill that adds the “Confusion” status, it is still Mind Saber that helped him. Or else regardless if it’s the Greedy Giant Toad or the Zephyr Bird, if he is confused and cannot control his movement then during that period of confusion he will easily die.</p>
<p>His body stayed in the water the whole time and continued moving forward following the flow of the water. Xiao Hui also followed closely behind, his movements as free as walking on land. Every dozen seconds Ling Chen has to come out of the water to breath. And during this time is when the Zephyr Bird locks onto him again… But repeating it time after time the Zephyr Bird that cannot swim has been unable to do anything to Ling Chen the entire time. In-between it has also released many times Cold Wind Fang, Frenzied Wind and Piercing Cry but they’ve all been unable to take effect… This flowing stream in the chasm has become Ling Chen’s perfect protection shelter.</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird is unable to harm him, and Ling Chen is likewise unable to escape from the claws of the Zephyr Bird that from the beginning to the end never gave up pursuing him, the anxiety in his heart also became increasingly greater. Because the Zephyr Bird has the time to waste but he does not… Everytime he comes out of the water to breath he has to take a yellow potion at the first instant to return his HP to max, just like that consuming them bottle after bottle. Before entering this trial he bought a total of 200 yellow potions. Under the pursuit of the Zephyr Bird, in just twenty over minutes he has already consumed almost 100 bottles. If he consumes all of his yellow potions, then… There really only is death this one path remaining. Even escaping from the Zephyr Bird’s claws will be impossible.</p>
<p>In addition, in this period of time he has been carried by the river a total distance of about 10 kilometers… But he gradually noticed that he’d already moved following the river for so long yet the surrounding scenery hasn’t changed much the entire time.</p>
<p>A thought slowly formed in his mind… Could it be that this scenery is actually an infinite loop? Or else how can I have still not reached the end or the edge in a trial map that shouldn’t be too big after being carried away for 10 kilometers!</p>
<p>If it’s really like this, then, the so called geographical turning point will not appear. If things continue like this then not too long later he will be wasted to death alive!</p>
<p>I can’t continue like this anymore!</p>
<p>Ling Chen continued to swim following the water but his gaze already no longer looked upward, instead searching around the surroundings looking for things that can help him.</p>
<p>Once again coming out of the water and taking big breaths. Without question when he returned his HP to max the Zephyr Bird’s green eyes had already tightly locked on to him, flying over to him in the sound of wind. Ling Chen exhaled, when he was just about to dive into the water again he suddenly saw that on the mountain wall a couple dozen meters in front, at the position near the surface of the water there reflected a shadow about the size of a human.</p>
<p>That is…</p>
<p>Ling Chen quickly sank into the water dodging the Zephyr Bird’s charge attack and then followed the river continuing to swim forward, but his gaze tightly focused on the direct of the shadow that he saw before.</p>
<p>Swimming closer and closer following the river, when he got close he finally confirmed that that is indeed a cave set in the mountain wall. Judging from the thickness of the shadow this cave should be relatively deep. Right away, he held his breath, rapidly swimming to the position close to that mountain wall. He then stepped on a protruding stone beneath the water and jumped up in the water.</p>
<p>This position is only a few dozen meters away from the Zephyr Bird. With the Zephyr Bird’s flying speed this is a particularly dangerous distance. Sure enough, when he jumped out in the water the Zephyr Bird’s aura had already locked onto him. It then brought up a wild windstorm flying towards him, the distance was shortened in the the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Ling Chen who jumped up from the water tightly held onto a rock in front, he then applied force again and jumped, directly jumping out of the water and landing at the edge of the cave… Behind him the dangerous aura approached. He did not turn around, against the Zephyr Bird’s speed he also cannot dodge, directly using the Celestial Aqua Scale to block behind him.</p>
<p>Bam!!</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird was bounced away by the Celestial Aqua Scale and Ling Chen was also bumped forward, his footsteps stumbling rushing into the dark cave.</p>
<p>After entering the cave Ling Chen let out a long sigh of relief because no matter if it’s the size or depth of this cave it was all what he hoped to see the most. A height and width of about 2 meters was entirely enough for him to enter and move, but the Zephyr Bird is unable to enter. Ling Chen rapidly walked into the interior of the cave. This cave should have been naturally formed, the interior shape is very uneven. After a dozen steps Ling Chen had already reached the end. This cave is not a straight line but instead has a slightly large curve… This also means that even if the Zephyr Bird releases Cold Wind Fang at the entrance, all he needs to do is hide in the position after the curve and he will not be hit.</p>
<p>Should be very safe. Ling Chen relaxed, leaning on the damp stone wall in fatigue. Being in the water for almost half an hour and at the same time also constantly being in a state of high tension, this is a fairly large drain on his mind. The sound the the Zephyr Bird’s or nearby or faraway cries constantly travelled into his ears… The Zephyr Bird did not leave, but evidently it also knows that it cannot enter this cave. It can only helplessly circle around the cave.</p>
<p>“Woof…”</p>
<p>Beside his feet came the sensation of soft rubbing. Ling Chen opened his eyes crouching down, his hand lightly placing on top of Xiao Hui’s head and helplessly saying: “Besides hiding here we probably don’t have any other methods.”</p>
<p>“Whimper…” Xiao Hui opened wide its round eyes, not knowing how to respond to its maser. Ling Chen was always being chased by the Zephyr Bird, and from beginning to end the Zephyr Bird treated it like it didn’t exist. It never launched any attacks at it. Its gift of not drawing aggro is not false.</p>
<p>Ling Chen silently stood in the deepest part of the cave, not having any actions the entire time. He was waiting… Waiting for the Zephyr Bird to leave on its own after its patience vanishes, even though he knows in his heart that this possibility is actually not very big.</p>
<p>There was no luck, 10 minutes… 20 minutes… After a half hour passed by Ling Chen could still feel the presence of the Zephyr Bird outside of the cave, or he could still hear the sound of its cries. Ling Chen helplessly looked at the time. It was already six in the morning. At this time in the hot summer the sky of the real world has already brightened, it has also almost reached the time for him to prepare breakfast for Ling Shuiruo.</p>
<p>After thinking things through he finally decided to temporarily leave.</p>
<p>“Hope I can freely log out in the map… I hope so.”</p>
<p>Silently saying to himself Ling Chen issued the command to log out.</p>
<p>“Ding… You are currently in ‘War God’s Trial Ground’, after logging out you will be directly sent out, cannot enter again, are you sure you want to leave?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was not surprised by this result. The guardian of the Hall of Heroic Souls also said that one person can only enter this map once. If he chooses to leave right now he will directly leave this place, unable to enter again. At the same time he will even lose all of the opportunities of the Hall of Heroic Souls. (TL: I have no clue what this means, could be my raw, could be something I’m not getting. I think he’s talking about the opportunity to enter the Hall again.)</p>
<p>But against the stubbornly chasing Zephyr Bird he also truly does not have any other choices. At least after logging out and being sent out what he loses is an opportunity and not his life… The result is a lot better compared to dying here.</p>
<p>Sure enough the trial that made six of Forgotten Continent’s peerless geniuses lose their lives is heinously difficult.</p>
<p>Yet, after being silent for a moment Ling Chen cancelled the command to log out. Lifting his gaze he simultaneously equipped Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud in his hands.</p>
<p>Messing around with this damned bird for so long but only able to return without any results. Before leaving… How can he not give it a big gift!!</p>
<p>His gaze becoming cold, Ling Chen directly charged straight out in the direction of the cave entrance and was then exposed in light. The instant that he appeared the Zephyr Bird circling in the sky discovered him. With a sharp cry it rushed straight at him in a roaring wind.</p>
<p>The wild wind brought up by Mid-Air Charge made Ling Chen almost unable to stand steadily, but he did not dodge. Instead he welcomed the Zephyr Bird’s body, slowly raising up his right arm!</p>
<p>“Moon Shadow!!”</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge’s light jumped up, dragging out the Zephyr Bird’s massive shadow and also freezing the Zephyr Bird that was nearly about to touch Ling Chen’s body right in front of him. Ling Chen took a step forward, “Fire of Rage” and “Soul Sacrifice” simultaneously activating, his dual weapons attacking in a flurry with Full Power Strike…</p>
<p>Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>8 attacks, 0 hits, but this was also entirely within Ling Chen’s expectations. He took a step back, his eyes focusing and then throwing “Shooting Soaring Cloud” at the Zephyr Bird… Before leaving no matter what he needs to hurt it once!</p>
<p>Fwoosh!!</p>
<p>-4698!</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s defense is indeed not very high, compared to the regular zephyr bird it is not that much stronger. The instant that Soaring Cloud pierced through its body it directly took away almost 1/40 of its HP. Soaring Cloud that was thrown out fell from the sky after all of its force dissipated, falling into the flowing water. At this moment the Zephyr Bird recovered from being frozen, but Ling Chen had also already rapidly returned within the cave, placing himself in the safest position. Even though a Shooting Soaring Cloud under his most extreme state dealt a decent amount of damage to the Zephyr Bird, but in a short period of time it will automatically recover all of its lost health making what Ling Chen did essentially useless.</p>
<p>“Xiao Hui, go retrieve Soaring Cloud!” Ling Chen yelled towards Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui accepted the command, its body bringing up a grey shadow springing out of the cave and jumping into the water. It headed straight in the direction of Soaring Cloud and then held Soaring Cloud in its mouth… It was just about to return when suddenly the tip of the horn on its head started to flash a sometimes strong, sometimes weak grey light. Xiao Hui’s body immediately stopped there. Only after a few seconds did it turn around returning. When it turned around the glow on its horn disappeared.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui returned to the cave and placed Soaring Cloud in front of Ling Chen. Ling Chen was just about to praise it yet he saw Xiao Hui swiftly run away from in front of him and then jump out of the cave entrance into the water, rapidly rushing following the direction of the river.</p>
<p>“Xiao Hui, where are you going!!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen furrowed his eyebrows, risking the danger of being attacked by the Zephyr Bird and charging outside of the cave. Yet he discovered that Xiao Hui was already dozens of meters away and then it plunged into the water disappearing from sight. The instant before it disappeared, Ling Chen seemed to have saw a ray of grey coloured light.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>What’s that you say, the title’s are too obvious? Here.</p>
<p>P.S.: Um… Mistake post again. I’ll just leave this here but there’s not going to be a post tomorrow.</p>
<p>The moment Ling Chen appears he will definitely draw the attack of the Zephyr Bird. After watching Xiao Hui dive into the water he also quickly returned into the cave, his mind puzzled. He did not forcibly recall Xiao Hui. Xiao Hui was born not too long and it was exceptionally close to him. Moreover in the pet status it also stated the three words “will never betray”, so it will definitely not run away from him on its own without a reason. He faintly guessed that it seemed that Xiao Hui had discovered something at a certain location.</p>
<p>Right now if he chooses to log out then Xiao Hui will also be forcibly recalled to the pet space. He did not leave, standing at the safest location in the depths of the cave silently awaiting Xiao Hui’s return.</p>
<p>Outside of the cave the Zephyr Bird’s long cries constantly travelled over. Seemingly that unless Ling Chen dies or disappears from this map, it will continue to follow him, absolutely not leaving.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui left for a very long time. When Ling Chen was practically unable to resist calling it back a light splashing sound came from the entrance of the cave, Xiao Hui had finally returned. Only when it ran all the way to the front of Ling Chen did he see that its mouth was holding an orb surrounded by a soft glow… Accurately speaking it was sucking it in its mouth, because Xiao Hui’s mouth was too small and that orb was too big, it simply could notcompletely hold it in its mouth. Xiao Hui put the orb on the ground and shook off the water droplets on its body. It wagged its tail using its bright eyes to stare at Ling Chen, signaling him to pick up the orb.</p>
<p>Ling Chen immediately completely understood everything… In Xiao Hui’s innate talent it is stated that it is particularly sensitive towards treasures. It can discover the presence of all kinds of treasure from far away and then find the precise location. It left before definitely because it discovered the presence of a treasure at a certain location so it rushed over looking for it. This orb that it brought over is the treasure that it found!</p>
<p>This item that Xiao Hui found, what is it?</p>
<p>Ling Chen crouched down picking up the orb. The orb is a silver colour and is about the size of his palm, he can just perfectly hold it with one hand. And the instant that he held it in his hands, a familiar feeling suddenly appeared in his heart. He faintly felt that it seemed like just not too long ago that he obtained a similar, or maybe it should be said to be exactly the same item of the same size and weight. His gaze landed on it… In the semi-transparent orb there reflected the fuzzy image of an arrowhead shape.</p>
<p>Wait… This size, weight, feeling… and this shape…</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s eyes fiercely jumped… He finally understood what this familiar feeling was, because the size and weight of this orb along with its glow are all the same as the Gemini Orb that he got before. And the blurry image reflected within is clearly the shape of Saggitarius of the twelve zodiacs!</p>
<p>Could this… Could this be…</p>
<p>He slightly shook his head, and then used a trembling gaze to look at this orb’s information.</p>
<p>[Sagittarius Orb]: Type: Energy Orb, Grade: Mysterious God, Attribute: None. Equipment Requirement: Can only be slotted in [Lunar Scourge].</p>
<p>Attributes: All attacks [Absolute Hit] (Ignore [Absolute Dodge] status), damage+50% when using any “arrow” class attack. Shooting range+50%, and triggers [Lossless Piercing] 100% of the time. (TL: Lossless piercing I’m assuming is no damage reduction when piercing through multiple targets. The direct translation is something like “No weakening piercing”. Suggestions welcomed.)</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s pupils contracted, holding the orb in his hand and spacing out for a long time, almost unable to believe his eyes.</p>
<p>In this War God’s Trial Ground, the item that Xiao Hui brought back after abruptly leaving… Is actually Lunar Scourge’s ninth exclusive god orb — The Sagittarius Orb!!</p>
<p>In regards to finding Lunar Scourge’s exclusive god orb’s and saint orbs Ling Chen has always been in a blank state because he simply doesn’t know where they all are, even Qi Yue also doesn’t know. But what can be certified is that those orb with the strength of Mysterious God and Saint Destroyer will definitely not exist in regular places. They might be in extreme places that regular people are unable to reach, or maybe in a closed area that nobody can arrive at, or maybe in the hands of extremely powerful beings, because it is only so that they can safely exist. When Tao Tie handed over the Gemini Orb to him, he also said that to find the rest of the exclusive orbs is incredibly difficult and that it could takes hundreds or even thousands of years of time. And now, from when he obtained Lunar Scourge it has not even reached one day’s time…</p>
<p>Just like that, the Sagittarius Orb this easily appeared in his hands!</p>
<p>No… was it really easy?</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s gaze shifted away from the Sagittarius Orb and froze on Xiao Hui’s body… This is the Sagittarius Orb that Xiao Hui found, it was probably found at a certain location in the deepest parts of the river. And if not for its ability to discover treasure then even if he went numerous rounds around here, even if he passed the trial in the War God’s Trial Ground, he wouldn’t have even noticed its existence. At the same time, one person can only enter into this map a total of one time, it is an absolutely enclosed space. If he missed it then that would have been the same as forever losing it!</p>
<p>“Xiao Hui! You did a stupendous job!!” Ling Chen rubbed Xiao Hui’s head, complimenting it in excitement. Right now he is practically unable to explain how lucky he is gaining Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>Using that non-elemental orb in exchange for the birth of Xiao Hui before the trial was entirely the most correct choice ever.</p>
<p>Could it be, this is fate!?</p>
<p>Looking at the stats of the Sagittarius Orb in his hand and listening to the sounds of the Zephyr Bird beside his ears, the corners of Ling Chen’s lips started to slowly curve up, drawing back a dangerous smile.</p>
<p>Absolute hit…Truly an orb of the same level as the Gemini Orb, what it adds is a terrifying stat that makes people breathless!! This means that as long as he has this orb, he can treat the “dodge” attribute of the entire Mystic Moon world as nothing! This means that he no longer needs to pay attention to hit ability and can chase after extreme attack ability to his heart’s content! This means that all of his attacks will never “Miss” ever again, means that his attack efficiency will obtain the most ultimate upgrade!!</p>
<p>And also means the death of that Zephyr Bird outside!!</p>
<p>The Sagittarius Orb doesn’t just have one stat. It not only has the ability “absolute hit”, it can also greatly increase the damage and shooting range of arrow type attacks and can 100% trigger lossless piercing. For archers this is virtually an op effect. The Sagittarius Orb is like an orb specially born for the “Arrow”. Looking at these kinds of stats Ling Chen’s heart even appeared a regret of not choosing the apprentice archer class at the Novice Village. If he was an archer right now, with this Sagittarius Orb how terrifying of a degree would his ability rise to right now!</p>
<p>What made Ling Chen slightly puzzled was why the appearance of the Sagittarius Orb did not draw out Qi Yue, but this was not what he cared about. He extended his right hand, holding up the Sagittarius Orb and slotting it towards Lunar Scourge’s ninth slot. The instant that they touched a silver light flashed by and the Sagittarius Orb had already shrunk. In the notification sound of “Slotting successful”, in the ninth hole of Lunar Scourge a silver glow was released.</p>
<p>“Ding… Sagittarius Orb slotting successful. All of your attacks will have “Absolute Hit”, when using any ‘arrow’ class attack damage increased by 50%, shooting range+50%, and 100% chance to trigger lossless piercing.”</p>
<p>After the Sagittarius Orb was successfully slotted everything returned to silence. It did not unlock one of Lunar Scourge’s exclusive skills after slotting like the Gemini Orb. But this did not dowse Ling Chen’s excitement. He opened his stat page, surprisingly seeing that the value after his hit attribute had turned into “????”.</p>
<p>Very good, truly excellent!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen slowly stood up, looking towards the outside of the cave. With the Sagittarius Orb the originally undefeatable Zephyr Bird is no longer scary… More accurately speaking, in Ling Chen’s eyes it is already a dead bird!</p>
<p>Waiting for all of his skills to finish cooling down. Ling Chen equipped Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud in his two hands, taking quick steps walking out of the cave and standing at the cave entrance looking at the sky. (TL: I’m confused which of his skills are on cooldown? His skill with the highest cooldown is Soul Sacrifice at 200 seconds but the author said that Ling Chen waited a long time for Xiao Hui, is 200 seconds that long, or am I missing something?)</p>
<p>In the instant that he appeared the circling Zephyr Bird immediately sped downward, rushing towards him like a green coloured missile. Right now, its HP that was reduced by Soaring Cloud before has already returned to full. Ling Chen’s face did not have a hint of fear, welcoming its massive figure and lifting his right hand activating “Moon Shadow” at the most suitable time.</p>
<p>The strange light flickering, the Zephyr Bird was completely frozen when it was at a distance of not even 3 meters away from Ling Chen. Ling Chen rapidly rushed forward, buffing himself with “Fire of Rage” and “Soul Sacrifice”, “Full Power Strike” heavily smashing at it.</p>
<p>-2380, -2347!</p>
<p>Following the landing of those two Full Power Strikes, two dazzling blood-red numbers floated up from the Zephyr Bird’s body, two attacks all hit. The angle of Ling Chen’s curved lips slightly increased, his movements not stopping at all using his fastest speed to cut away…</p>
<p>-2360, -4722, -4698, -2482, -2339.</p>
<p>At the last second, left hand Sand Blade “Full Power Strike”, right hand Soaring Cloud “Shooting Soaring Cloud”, heavily hitting the Zephyr Bird’s body.</p>
<p>-2342, -9418!</p>
<p>The powerful critical hit rate added by the Heartless Orb isn’t a joke. Ten attacks triggered a total of three critical hits. Especially the critical hit of Shooting Soaring Cloud dealing out almost 10 thousand damage. When the Zephyr Bird recovered from its frozen status, its HP had dropped by nearly 20%!</p>
<p>Powerful attacks for 5 seconds under his ultimate state with all of them hitting, in total dealing over 35 thousand damage!!</p>
<p>And if he did not have the Sagittarius Orb, only “Shooting Soaring Cloud” would be able to hit out of these ten attacks.</p>
<p>Like so, even after 200 seconds the Zephyr Bird’s HP will only be able to recover by 20 thousand and not all of it to full.</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird that had been badly hurt let out a series of sorrowful cries, but before it could attack, the target in front had already swiftly run away, hiding in that deep part of the cave that cut off all of its attacks. It circled back and forth around the surroundings of the cave entrance but was simply unable to do anything to Ling Chen. Straightforwardly speaking, this attack style of Ling Chen’s is extremely shameless. If he were to fight face to face with the Zephyr Bird then with a flap of the Zephyr Bird’s wings he would unquestionably die. But, what decides victory is not just strength, but also luck, mentality and geography… That is what a true battle is!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Xiao Hui, go retrieve Soaring Cloud!”</p>
<p>Of course he can’t take the risk of being killed by the Zephyr Bird to personally go pick up the thrown out Soaring Cloud, but he has Xiao Hui. Under his mental command Xiao Hui ran straight towards Soaring Cloud’s position. Regardless if it’s on land or in the water Xiao Hui is always as fast like a grey shadow. Moments later it had already sucked Soaring Cloud in its mouth and brought it back. Xiao Hui’s body size is very small, its four limbs added together aren’t even as long as Soaring Cloud. But the suction of its mouth is very strong. Even the corpses of a large pile of creatures can be sucked into its mouth and devoured in a short period of time, not to mention a light weapon.</p>
<p>Holding Soaring Cloud in his hand again, Ling Chen stuck to the wall, quietly waiting for his skills to cooldown. And now… The appearance of the Sagittarius Orb has made him no longer have any thoughts of logging out again.</p>
<p>After 60 seconds Moon Shadow’s cooldown time reset. Ling Chen swiftly charge out from the cave and then attracted over the Zephyr Bird. He raised his right arm again using Lunar Scourge’s Moon Shadow to freeze the Zephyr Bird’s body a couple meters in front of him, and then rushed forward continuously slashing down ten Full Power Strikes.</p>
<p>-428, -420, -842, -419, -425, -430, -419, -418, -838, -422.</p>
<p>Without Soul Sacrifice his attack ability evidently cannot compare to his ultimate state. But the stacked attack strength of dual weapons adding that the Zephyr Bird’s defense is very low, ten Full Powered Strikes also eliminated over 5000 of the Zephyr Bird’s HP. After ten attacks Ling Chen lifted his legs and ran. The Zephyr Bird that had recovered its freedom could only once again miss its attack, releasing an angered bird cry but unable to do anything.</p>
<p>A massive body will indeed give people a sort of pressure on one’s aura and vision, but sometimes it is definitely not a good thing.</p>
<p>Another 60 seconds, Moon Shadow’s cooldown time once again refreshed, he repeated the process, rushing out of the cave and drawing over the Zephyr Bird… And then another ten Full Power Strikes taking away around 5000 of its HP, afterwards beating a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing that the Zephyr Bird is just a low-intelligence bird. If it was a human with mature intelligence then they would definitely be fuming with anger… But then again, if the Zephyr Bird had high enough intelligence then it also wouldn’t be so easily controlled by Ling Chen in the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>200 seconds passed by, Soul Sacrifice’s cooldown time also refreshed. The following round of attacks will be attacks under his ultimate state. He rushed out of the cave, staring at the approaching Zephyr Bird… Before the Zephyr Bird’s approach brought a sense of danger. Now watching it flying over Ling Chen felt like it was in a rush to come die.</p>
<p>“Moon Shadow!” In the light of Lunar Scourge the Zephyr Bird was completely frozen.</p>
<p>“Fire of Rage!”</p>
<p>“Soul Sacrifice!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen rushed forward, his gaze first stopping on its HP for an instant and then afterwards was a flurry of wild attacks.</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s HP — 153 802/180 000! In these 200 seconds, it recovered 20 000 HP. But in these 200 seconds, the damage Ling Chen dealt towards it was over 45 000! Its HP recovery speed simply could not compare to its rate of loss.</p>
<p>-2360, -4722, -2338, -4782, -2339, -2380, -2369, -2459… The last attack, Shooting Soaring Cloud!</p>
<p>-4792!</p>
<p>An incomparable storm of attacks, the Zephyr Bird’s HP dropped another 30 thousand over points… Its health bar was instantly cleared by a whole ⅓.</p>
<p>After attacking Ling Chen returned into the cave at the first moment. In a bit Xiao Hui retrieved the thrown out Soaring Cloud… Afterwards, were the same repeated actions. When Moon Shadow’s cooldown time refreshes, he will rush out of the cave and draw over the Zephyr Bird following with a rain of Full Power Strikes. After two rounds of attacks is the extreme attack under his Soul Sacrifice state. The last attack is the currently most lethal Shooting Soaring Cloud. Just like that looping over again and again. The entire process was easy and relaxing, there was practically no danger to speak of.</p>
<p>One Sagittarius Orb made the initially hopeless battle turn into being controlled by Ling Chen. The originally undefeatable Celestial Beast is also not that scary anymore, instead being played in the palm of his hand… This is the strength of Mysterious God orbs.</p>
<p>But, a Celestial Beast is after all still a Celestial Beast. Even if it’s this kind of shameless attack style, eliminating it still isn’t something that can be done in a short period of time. In this repeated loop, the Zephyr Bird’s HP slowly dropped… Finally, at the 18th round, following Ling Chen’s fourth round of Full Power Strikes, the Zephyr Bird’s HP dropped below 19 000.</p>
<p>18 652/180 000!</p>
<p>Yet at this time Ling Chen who could originally continue attacking stopped attacking and prematurely returned within the cave, glancing at Soul Sacrifice that still had just exactly 60 seconds left to cooldown… The Zephyr Bird still has an unactivated wind destruction skill “Nightmare Whirlwind”. This destruction skill can induce the chaos of the wind element in a large area around the surroundings… Including the space that he is in. If he lets the Zephyr Bird activate this skill then even if he hides in the cave he will still be affected, thus falling one step short of success.</p>
<p>And this ultimate skill’s triggering condition is when its HP is below 10%. So when the Zephyr Bird’s HP just barely reached 10% he stopped attacking, waiting the the next round to finish it in one go.</p>
<p>60 seconds passed by very quickly, Moon Shadow’s and Soul Sacrifice’s cooldown times refreshed at the same time. Ling Chen rushed out of the cave, his gaze locking onto the Zephyr Bird at the first instant and also locking onto its current health value…</p>
<p>25 252/ 180 000!</p>
<p>The remaining HP was entirely enough for him to clear it under his ultimate attack state.</p>
<p>Focusing his gaze on the Zephyr Bird Ling Chen lifted up Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud… Come down, and then, everything can end!</p>
<p>As if hearing the calling in his heart, the Zephyr Bird still mechanically charged over after seeing Ling Chen appear even though every time it flew down it would be frozen and then suffer a round of violent attacks. This is the difference between low-intelligence creatures and high-intelligence creatures. This is also the primary reason why creatures of the same level are always stronger than humans, but humans are always able to beat them. (TL: I don’t think this has anything to do with intelligence anymore, this bird just has no survival instinct.)</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge’s strange light flashed up and once again instantly froze the Zephyr Bird’s body. Ling Chen lifted up Sand Blade and Soaring Cloud, charging over in a straight line….</p>
<p>-4718, -2356, -4720, –2348, –2395, -4782, -2339, -2380…</p>
<p>The scene, froze on the spear in Ling Chen’s hand. That instant that he used the same movement to cut into the Zephyr Bird’s body. This is the fourth round of Ling Chen’s Full Power Strikes. And before him, the Zephyr Bird’s health bar had already become empty, being completely emptied by Ling Chen’s attacks…</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird’s shadow disappeared, it’s body also regained freedom, but it was already unable to move again. The instant that Moon Shadow’s effect vanished, it spread its wings releasing its last cry of sorrow. The green glow on its body dissipated and its body also weakly fell forward in the scattered wind element, dropping in the front of Ling Chen.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully killed LV15 Celestial BOSS ‘Revived Zephyr Bird’, Fame+1500, SP+1500.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Congratulations you have levelled up, now LV11, gained 5 AP.”</p>
<p>This powerful Celestial beast that forced Ling Chen into desperate situations numerous times, that even made Ling Chen decide to give up finally died. The colossal experience of a Celestial beast made Ling Chen gain a level even under the effect of “Heaven’s Jealousy”. His experience rose all the way to 40% of LV11. The experience given by Celestial Beasts is huge. At the early stage of the game single-handedly killing a Celestial beast can directly increase one level or even more. But, how many people are there in the world who can actually solo a Celestial BOSS at the early stage of the game? Even if it’s Ling Chen, if it weren’t for the protection of the Celestial Aqua Scale, the protection of the chasm water… Along with the mountain cave and Sagittarius Orb that later appeared as if it were fate. Don’t mention defeating the Zephyr Bird, he probably would have already died under its claws.</p>
<p>The stuffiness built up in his chest all rushed out as if having found an outlet of release. Ling Cheng watched the Zephyr Bird fall over, his vision appeared a moment of haziness… Entering the game for a short few days another Celestial Beast that player’s are unable to beat fell at his hands, all of this was really a bit too dream-like.</p>
<p>Encountering the Zephyr Bird, what he bore was incomparably huge pressure and one after another dangerous walks around the edges of death. But now he has killed it… He admits that him being able to kill the Zephyr Bird is absolutely not because his strength was stronger than its, but more like the protection of fate. If not for the sudden appearance of the Sagittarius Orb he would have already chosen to log out right now. If not for Xiao Hui, there would not have been the appearance of the Sagittarius Orb. And if not for the guardian of the Hall of Heroic Souls giving him a “Spirit Shield Orb”, Xiao Hui would also not have been born. If not for him finding the mountain wall cave, he would have already died in the water of the chasm, everything afterwards would not have happened… But then again, being able to use all kinds of items and abilities he possessed and even the surrounding environment to the greatest degree, the most appropriately, in and of itself is a powerful ability.</p>
<p>“Xiao Hui, this is all your credit!” Ling Chen patted Xiao Hui’s head, praising him from the bottom of his heart. Today is the first day of birth for Xiao Hui. Right now it has only been not even an hour’s time since Xiao Hui was born. And this small period of time made Ling Chen clearly understand how powerful of a partner he’d gained. Even though it does not have any attack ability, but the help that it provides Ling Chen is even greater than that of 10 attack type pets.</p>
<p>The Zephyr Bird was soloed by Ling Chen at a difference of an entire 5 levels. Without any doubt when it died it was accompanied by an extremely flamboyant big explosion. Gold coins, potions and all kinds of items littered the ground. Ling Chen moved forward, picking up all of his rewards and then excitedly taking inventory item after item… Is there anything more exciting than checking the rewards dropped by a defeated Celestial boss? Eliminating this powerful opponent after nearly dying… What kind of big rewards will there be?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The thought crossed my mind to call this chapter, “Bird Jesus’ Stick”… But my judgement got the better of me.</p>
<p>Around 200 gold coins, 15 bottles of yellow potions, 3 green potions, dark blue potions 12, equipment… A whole 4 pieces!</p>
<p>[Wind Spirit’s Clothe]: Type: Full Body Light Armour, Grade: Gold, Equipment Requirements: Any archer class profession LV15 or above. Mystical clothes that contain wind elemental power. After wearing body becomes light and agile like wind. Attributes: Defense+50, Agility+15, HP+100, Attack Speed+15, Wind Elemental Resistance+10%.</p>
<p>Full body armor is a type of armor where the upper and lower garments are connected and is equivalent to upper garment+lower garment.. Its stats are also greatly superior to a single piece of upper garment or lower garment of the same level and grade. This Wind Spirit’s Clothe may be one piece of equipment, but it is entirely the same as two pieces of Gold equipment, its value is naturally also extremely high. And this full body light armour not only adds a very high agility stat, it also increases attack speed… This armour will become the best of the best amongst archer equipment. If the stats are publicized, who knows how many archers it would make drool all over the ground.</p>
<p>[Wind Riding Boots]: Type: Boots, Grade: Gold, Equipment Requirements: Any profession LV15 or above. Boots that hold deep, ethereal wind force. After wearing it you practically cannot feel any sense of weight. Attributes: Defense+20, Agility+8, Dodge+10, Movement Speed+10, Wind Elemental Resistance+5%.</p>
<p>Another piece of Gold gear, moreover it’s a pair of boots that adds a whole 10 points of movement speed. For any profession movement speed is always an extremely important attribute, it is also usually only boots/shoes that add movement speed. Ling Chen also immediately decided the owner of this pair of boots… Himself! With Item Manipulation Technique he can equip it when he reaches LV13.</p>
<p>[Wind Spirit Staff]: Type: Magic Staff (Long), Grade: Gold, Equipment Requirements: Any elementalist, priest or summoner class profession LV15 or above. A magic staff that harbours dense wind element, after equipping can buff the effects of wind magic. Attributes: Magic Attack Strength+50, Spirit+15, MP+50, All wind class spell damage+10%, all wind magic chanting time-20%.</p>
<p>The Wind Spirit Staff’s stats made Ling Chen speechless. Truly a piece of Gold equipment, this magic staff will greatly increase the strength of any magic class profession player that gets their hands on it. And if it falls into the hands of a wind class mage, that would simply be too terrifying… They would be able to directly pull far away from players originally of the same level of strength.</p>
<p>4 pieces of equipment, of them 3 are all Gold gear, truly the rewards from soloing a Celestial BOSS at a lower level. When Ling Chen held the last item in his hand, a colour of amazement flashed across his eyes… This is a long sword with a green-crystalline body, as if forged with the the highest quality emerald, unbelievably gorgeous. The sword hilt is a moderate size, able to be comfortably held in the hand. The sword blade is one meter long, the turquoise coloured crystal looked heavy, but it was actually incredibly light… Even a lot lighter than Sand Blade. The sword’s surface also flashed a fluctuating light green glow, Ling Chen even faintly sensed that there seemed to be currents of air circulating over the blade.</p>
<p>[Zephyr Blade]: Type: Two-Handed Sword, Grade: Celestial, Equipment Requirements: Any melee profession level 15 or above. A crystal sword forged from a pure wind elemental crystal. Light and sharp, it harbours within a high density of wind element. When swung it brings up the sound of howling wind and can freely release wind attribute attacks.</p>
<p>Attributes: Attack+110, Strength+20, Hit Rate+20, Attack Speed+20, when attacking 3% chance of causing the “Dazed” status.</p>
<p>Additional Attributes: Parry Judgement: 5; When attacking quickly will bring up a fierce wind pushing back the enemies in front.</p>
<p>Additional Skills: [Zephyr]: Release the wind element within the Zephyr Blade, causing all attacks to convert into wind attribute attacks. Can be activated and deactivated any time.</p>
<p>This turquoise coloured sword… Is actually a Celestial sword!!</p>
<p>At the same time Ling Chen was thrilled, a belated system notification rose up beside his ears:</p>
<p>“Ding… You have obtained Celestial item ‘Zephyr Blade’, it will be ranked number 1 in the China region equipment ranking list, do you need to hide your personal information?”</p>
<p>“No need!” Ling Chen tightly held the crystal sword in his hand, directly answering saying.</p>
<p>The next second, the China region’s equipment ranking list immediately changed:</p>
<p>China Region Equipment Ranking List:</p>
<p>Rank 1: Zephyr Blade, Type: Two-Handed Sword, Grade: Celestial, Owner: Ling Tian</p>
<p>Rank 2: Soaring Cloud, Type: Spear, Grade: Celestial, Owner: Ling Tian</p>
<p>The entire China region’s equipment ranking list in total only has two weapons… All belonging to Ling Chen alone!</p>
<p>Ling Tian… In a short period of time this name has repeatedly shocked the players of China. The first to obtain a Celestial item, the first to leave the Novice Village, and then obtaining the first pet… And it’s actually also a Celestial grade pet… Now, he’s actually gained another Celestial item.</p>
<p>If not for the fact that the Mystic Moon world is opened by the Cosmos Corporation that treats fairness as their lives and is guaranteed by dozens of the world’s most powerful countries along with the world’s ten biggest banks, players would first question if this person is a relative of Cosmos Corporation’s boss, or if he found some sort of loophole in the game world… But, developing until today the central cpu of virtual game world’s has already reached a nearly extreme perfection. There simply already no longers exists any so called loopholes or bugs. Even if they did appear, they would also be immediately patched by the central cpu at the first moment, this has already become general knowledge that is known to all. (TL: I don’t remember what I translated the company as before. Leave a comment if you guys remember.)</p>
<p>Then, that just leaves the last explanation… Either this person is blessed by rngesus, or this person possesses overpowered strength! But bullshit luck will always only ever be a coincidental matter. These actions of repeatedly shocking China and even the entire world, can it really be entirely explained as luck? Clearly not. Then, the explanation can only be the latter… The opening of every new virtual game world will always be accompanied by the appearance of one or multiple dark horses. But the “Ling Tian” this time, the momentum of the rise of this unfamiliar name is honestly a bit terrifying. All of China’s players can already no longer not remember this name, even those high and above massive guilds are also forced to focus more and more attention on the name “Ling Tian”.</p>
<p>“Ling Chen!! My idol!! Truly my only idol!! Truly the person that can tie against Eve, you actually obtained another Celestial item!! My god, how did you do it! Your name has practically exploded, I’d say all of China is talking about you… Even the county’s highest leaders also definitely already know your name… Oh right, I still haven’t told my little sis your name. She also doesn’t know that the savior that I found for her is the currently renowned ‘Ling Tian’. If she knew then she would definitely be thrilled to death!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s communication device rang with the voice of Yun Feng’s loud cries and shouts: “Cough cough, um, Ling Chen, you have two Celestial items now, what are your plans for them? Cough cough… You are the warrior profession, I am also the warrior profession. One sword, one spear, you definitely won’t be able to use them both, haha. Once I reach LV10 and get to Azure Dragon City, that, um, can… Cough Cough, can you let me use the one that you’re not using… Oh, you can also sell it to me, the price is up to you! A Celestial item, just thinking about it makes me buzzed… Hello! Hello? Say something… As long you are willing to agree, I’m willing to be your little bro! And you can also allow you to chase after my lil sis, my lil sis is an absolute beauty, not at all worse compared to your sister…”</p>
<p>“Say it later when you come to Azure Dragon City.”</p>
<p>Slam! Finishing saying one sentence Ling Chen very bluntly directly ended the call.</p>
<p>Ling Chen was not at all interested in what kind of reaction the appearance of the second Celestial item would induce in the outer world. He looked at the Zephyr Blade in amazement, hating that he cannot immediately equip it… Truly a Celestial item, just the added attack strength is as high as 110, almost triple of the Sand Blade in his hand. If he equips this sword his attack strength will once again greatly rise! What was slightly regretful is that the added skill “Zephyr” simply just converts attacks to the wind attribute. Compared to “Shooting Soaring Cloud” added by Soaring Cloud it appears a lot more pale and useless in comparison.</p>
<p>But, this is just what he thinks at the moment. When he equips this sword he will know how strong of an additional skill “Zephyr” is.</p>
<p>Even though he has the Item Manipulation Technique, Ling Chen still cannot equip the Zephyr Blade right now. He slightly reluctantly put away the Zephyr Blade, starting to continue taking inventory of his other spoils. Besides dropping 4 pieces of equipment the Zephyr Bird also dropped two scrolls along with two little items of unknown uses.</p>
<p>[Hidden Profession Scroll — Wind Spirit Marksman]: Hidden profession class change scroll, Usage Conditions: Level over LV10, after use can change classes to hidden profession “Wind Spirit Marksman”. After changing to this profession one can borrow the strength of the wind spirits to greatly enhance their body’s agility and movement speed, arrows shot out are quick as a gale of wind. The extreme of the class’s power can shoot out arrows of calamity like a tempest. When level reaches LV50, LV80 and LV100 class will automatically advance.</p>
<p>Another big unexpected harvest. This scroll in his hands is actually an incredibly rare and valuable hidden profession class change scroll that is entirely a priceless artifact!!</p>
<p>The number of existing hidden professions is honestly too little. Even if you find traces getting your hands on it is nearly impossible. How many players are there that look for a hidden profession their whole lives and are unable to find one. How many big wigs with huge power and resources that dream of obtaining a hidden profession but are all unable to do so. Hidden profession class change scrolls are one way of gaining a hidden profession. As long as one uses this scroll they will be able to directly change classes to the respective hidden profession. So these scroll have always been an astronomical price, and there is a price but no market. To obtain this kind of scroll who knows how lucky one has to be and what hardships and prices they had to experience. Even the people most lacking in cash are also mostly unwilling to sell them to other people.</p>
<p>Holding this hidden profession class change scroll Ling Chen’s heart even developed the impulse to use it… Because right now he has the Sagittarius Orb on him, if he changes class to an archer… Moreover a hidden archer profession, his strength will undoubtedly be way more terrifying than right now. Although, the impulse in his heart was also just an impulse, he wouldn’t actually do it. He came to change class to the strongest profession, of course he would not change to a different profession before that.</p>
<p>The other scroll looked more ordinary, like a sheet of white paper, there wasn’t any sort of flamboyant glow.</p>
<p>[Teleportation Scroll — Trial Ground Starting Point]: Spatial teleportation scroll, after use will be teleported to the starting point of War God’s Trial Ground. Can only be used once.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Pretty boring and repetitive chapter but here. And still cleaning so 90% no chapter tomorrow. I’m also going to need to come back and edit this chapter. Grammar is a lot worse than usual cause I rushed it a lot.</p>
<p>The scroll that teleports to the starting point of the trial, evidently it should be used after passing the trial… It can also be used when wanting to give up on the trial. Ling Chen held on to this scroll slightly pondering for a while — Why did this kind of scroll drop from the Zephyr Bird’s body? Could it be that the Zephyr Bird is the end of the trial? Then this trial seems to be a bit too short.</p>
<p>Putting away the scroll Ling Chen did not think about it any more, taking out the last two items the Zephyr Bird dropped. One of them is a black wooden plate. The wooden plate is not big, able to be just perfectly held in the hand. One side is black and smooth, the other side is etched with a big “Order” character.</p>
<p>Wait a sec… This is…</p>
<p>Holding this plate Ling Chen was dazed for a whole 5 seconds. After being surprised, a strange expression silently flashed across his face and then he put it away. This thing is exactly the same as that black wooden plate dropped by the Greedy Avarice Toad before. Which also means that he now already has two of these things on him!</p>
<p>When the last item the Zephyr Bird dropped entered his eyes, Ling Chen directly froze.</p>
<p>This is actually… a key…</p>
<p>Key…</p>
<p>[Rusted Key]: Usage unknown.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“If you want to obtain my strength inheritance, then walk to the end of this space and obtain the only key in this space to open the chest that you see…” (TL: Evidently, this is a quote, but I am too lazy to go check if I translated this the same as before and it’s not important so…)</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s mind played back the old voice that sounded at the starting point of this trial ground. That voice clearly mentioned “The only key in this space”, meaning in this trial ground there only exists on key…</p>
<p>Could it be that this key, is that key that can open that metal chest and then allow me to pass this trial?</p>
<p>The trial, is considered over after killing the Zephyr Bird?</p>
<p>But, I haven’t reached the end of the space? Accurately speaking, I’ve only advanced a very short distance in this space. I already fell down before even passing the first bridge and then was washed over here by the river.</p>
<p>Ling Chen held onto this key for a long time, still a bit unable to believe whether this was that key required to pass this trial. But slowly, he then calmed down. Recalling the events that happened after he entered this trial, sighing in his heart. Before entering he anticipated before that this would be a very difficult and also very long trial. Because in his memory, as long as it’s a trial there will be a lot of checkpoints set. The content of the trial is to pass one after another checkpoints, and the checkpoints will definitely be each one more difficult than the precious. In this War God’s trial, stepping on that bridge was the start of the trial. And then meeting the opponents of the trial… The Zephyr Bird also appeared from the very beginning, it only just changed its look later. If this really is the end of the trial, then this trial really also only had the Zephyr Bird this one enemy, those two undead sword page boys were basically foil-like existences. (TL: Foil, Don’t know if I used that right.)</p>
<p>There are no extra checkpoints, this trial’s opponent is really just the Zephyr Bird… But then again, is this not the true challenge? A person wanting to defeat a LV15 Celestial beast under extremely unfavorable circumstances that can even fly is itself already an almost impossible test. This kind of test is also already entirely enough. With War God’s level he also couldn’t be bothered to set up unnecessary things.</p>
<p>Did I really succeed? Successfully complete this trial that made 6 amazing geniuses die within a thousand years…</p>
<p>Besides the items the Zephyr Bird dropped, Ling Chen’s bag also has a good number of items dropped by the two undead sword page boys and the Undead Zephyr Bird. One LV15 Silver Wind Chaser Bow, one LV15 Silver two-handed sword, one LV15 Silver equipment Electrum Bracers, one LV15 silver coloured spear, one LV15 Copper Page Boy Robe. A decent number, but evidently incomparable to the items dropped by the Zephyr Bird. This is the massive difference between Lord bosses and Celestial bosses. Although if he takes out this equipment it can still create a big ripple amongst players. For the majority of players right now, Copper is already godly equipment and Silver is still a legendary existence… Ling Chen was honestly too far ahead of them. (TL: I say Electrum but the translation really is just something like Gold Embedded Bracers which sounds like crap and I couldn’t think of or find anything better. If you search up electrum, you’ll find that the combination of this being a silver grade equipment and having gold in it seems pretty fitting.)</p>
<p>Xiao Hui arrived at the Zephyr Bird’s corpse wagging its tail, opening its mouth wide and spraying out a grey light enveloping the Zephyr Bird’s corpse. In a bit, the Zephyr Bird’s corpse atomized, being completely and entirely sucked into Xiao Hui’s mouth. During the process of digesting the Zephyr Bird’s power, a series of level up halos continuously floated up from Xiao Hui’s head.</p>
<p>“Ding… Your pet Holy Spirit Beast ‘Xiao Hui’ has successfully risen to LV2, HP+200, MP+5, Defense+20.”</p>
<p>“Ding… Your pet Holy Spirit Beast ‘Xiao Hui’ has successfully risen to LV3, HP+200, MP+5, Defense+20.”</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>“Ding… Your pet Holy Spirit Beast ‘Xiao Hui’ has successfully risen to LV8, HP+200, MP+5, Defense+20.”</p>
<p>Devouring a LV15 Celestial Beast at a LV2 state, Xiao Hui’s level rose sharply in a short period of time. Jumping to LV8 from LV1 in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Holy Spirit Beast (Xiao Hui): Type: Beast Pet, Level: LV8, Grade: Celestial.</p>
<p>Attributes: HP: 3600, MP: 90, Physical Attack Strength: 1, Magic Attack Strength: 1, Physical Defense: 360, Hit Rate: 1, Dodge Rate: 1, Critical Hit Rate: 50%, Pierce Rate: 50%, Movement Speed: 300.</p>
<p>The stats of Xiao Hui that matured to LV8 made Ling Chen secretly speechless. Its LV8 health value reaches 3600, defense strength reaches 360… This is absolutely for sure 100% not HP and defense attributes that a regular Celestial pet can possess… Even Heaven End pets also cannot possess such stats. And besides the values on the surface, Xiao Hui also has a most overpowered passive defense skill “Holy Spirit Shield” that Ling Chen has ever seen in his life. He couldn’t help but think that if Xiao Hui could fight then how strong of a meat shield would it be. Even the Zephyr Bird from before shouldn’t even have the ability to insta-kill the current Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>“Burp…”</p>
<p>The eyes of Xiao Hui that finished devouring finally completely opened, its body shaking for an instant, seemingly burping. It shook its head, another “Burp” sound… Instantly, a dark green coloured, rock-like item was coughed out from its mouth, landing on the ground. Xiao Hui’s eyes brightened, hurriedly running over and picking up that green little rock with its mouth, cutely placing it in front of Ling Chen.</p>
<p>Devouring a couple of regular LV10 creatures the Plant Faeries before it refined out a permanent stat bonus item. What will appear now after devouring a Celestial beast? Ling Chen bent his waist, picking up this dark green rock.</p>
<p>[Wind Chaser Stone]: Type: Energy Crystal, Grade: Advanced, Attribute: Wind, Effect: Movement Speed+15.</p>
<p>After devouring the Zephyr Bird what Xiao Hui spit out was actually an energy crystal… It actually even refined out an energy crystal!!</p>
<p>Moreover this energy crystal is not a regular energy crystal, at least it definitely cannot be bought in shops. Its property is adding a whole 15 points of movement speed! Adding even more than the LV15 Wind Riding Boots that Ling Chen just got.</p>
<p>Refining out an advanced energy crystal from a LV15 Celestial creature… If it devours a higher level, or higher grade creature could it spit out an energy orb?</p>
<p>Ling Chen once again looked towards Xiao Hui in shock, staring at Xiao Hui that’s appearance looks completely harmless and wondering exactly how many shocking secrets it is hiding.</p>
<p>An advanced energy crystal, Ling Chen naturally unhesitatingly slotted it into Lunar Scourge. Even though the Wind Chaser Stone and the elementary speed crystal both increase movement speed, their ways of increasing are different so they do not conflict. Under the stacking of the Wind Chaser Stone and the elementary speed crystal Ling Chen’s movement speed reached 132. A value that is definitely above that of normal players.</p>
<p>Ling Chen checked the surroundings. After confirming that he did not miss anything he tightly held that rusted key the Zephyr Bird dropped, holding up the the teleportation scroll that goes back to the starting point. He was just about to crush the scroll when an untimely soft seductive voice that made his entire body uncontrollably numb sounded beside his ear.</p>
<p>“Little master, I think I sense the aura of the Sagittarius Orb.. Huh?”</p>
<p>Black light rising up, an incredibly enchanting female body appeared before Ling Chen. Qi Yue’s eyes were half-opened, the peerless beautiful face still remained a bit of blankness from just waking up from sleep. her entire body carried a sort of lovely to look at lazy beauty… At least, when Ling Chen saw her his gaze stopped on her body for a long time before difficulty moving away. He was unable to not admit that regardless if it is intentional or not, this woman emitted a devil-like allure sufficient enough to instantly light up the fire of lust in men.</p>
<p>Qi Yue moved her feet, delicately and gracefully walking towards him. When her gaze landed upon Lunar Scourge, her misty sleepiness dissipated in an instant, what replaced it was deep astonishment: “The Sagittarius Orb?”</p>
<p>She still slightly couldn’t believe that what was embedded in the ninth hole was actually the Sagittarius Orb!</p>
<p>“Just found it.” Ling Chen said a bit helplessly. Looks like I really can’t rely on Qi Yue to find the exclusive orbs. Her sensitivity towards those orbs is indeed extremely limited, it’s already slotted back onto Lunar Scourge and she didn’t even sense it at the first moment.</p>
<p>The surprise in Qi Yue’s expression lasted for a long time before gradually disappearing. She glanced at the surrounding environment, revealing an unmatchable charming smile towards Ling Chen: “Little master, you’ve really made me so surprised. Actually finding the Sagittarius Orb this quickly! Truly the person that can subdue Lunar Scourge, how should I thank little master?”</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s smiling face was like a beautiful flower, but the depths of her heart were stirring with deep shock. She knows very well in her heart how difficult it is to find Lunar Scourge’s exclusive orbs. Being able to use an average of ten years time to find one orb is already extremely idealistic. Yet, right now it has only been not even one day’s time since leaving the bottom of the chasm…</p>
<p>The Sagittarius Orb has actually already been found!! And in this time Qi Yue was in a state of deep sleep, completely unaware of what has already happened.</p>
<p>Finding an exclusive orb in not even one day…If this is luck, then that’s practically luck as big as the skies!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Firstly, my review of Samyang Spicy Fried Chicken Ramyun… Fuck me… Secondly, it’s been a while since I’ve had to type in such detail about how beautiful a female is and how perfect her body is… Fuck me again… Thirdly, you’ll notice the word Doge in this chapter. That is because Qi Yue decides to call the dog Xiao Hui Hui as a nickname which translates to Little Grey Grey, sounds weird but it’s a common thing to just repeat a character in one’s name as a nickname. Go vote at the poll page for your preferred nickname. Also, I don’t really like leaving the name as Xiao Hui anymore so go vote at the poll page for that too. Poll page.</p>
<p>Ling Chen very clearly understood what Qi Yue was thinking in her heart. He opened his mouth saying: “This place is a closed-off trial map, usually there will not be any outside beings entering here. The Sagittarius Orb was found here. It is also exactly because this place is closed-off that the Sagittarius Orb was able to exist here the whole time. Although, it was not me that found that Sagittarius Orb, but Xiao Hui.”</p>
<p>“Xia Hui?” Qi Yue revealed a puzzled expression. Right away, following the direction of Ling Chen’s gaze she saw Xiao Hui that was beside Ling Chen’s foot and that was so small that Qi Yue had not noticed it the entire time. Her gaze froze on this little creature’s body, and then her thin eyebrows arched upwards, her lips drawing up a captivating smile: “You’re called Xiao Hui? A very cute name, I’ll be calling you Doge from now on, okay?”</p>
<p>Qi Yue was evidently the second living person that Xiao Hui saw after being born. Facing her gaze Xiao Hui’s feet shuffled backwards, nervously hiding behind Ling Chen, two black eyes cautiously and timidly staring at her. Ling Chen’s gaze lowered, lightly saying: “No need to be nervous Xiao Hui, she’s not a bad person.”</p>
<p>Xiao Hui can understand human language… At least it can understand him, this Ling Chen could confirm. Although he couldn’t quite confirm exactly whether or not Qi Yue was a good person. But at least right now she doesn’t appear like a bad person… Besides constantly trying to tease him.</p>
<p>Listening to Ling Chen’s words Xiao Hui’s actions slightly relaxed.</p>
<p>Qi Yue stared at Xiao Hui for a good while, actually unable to determine what kind of being it belongs to, having no choice but to slightly lift her head and say towards Ling Chen: “Little master, can you let me see its abilities? This should be that little creature that Tao Tie that big guy handed over to you, but I am actually unable to determine its origin. Let me see it’s data, maybe I’ll have an answer.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen though for a bit, sharing Xiao Hui’s information in front of Qi Yue. Because he also really wanted to know Xiao Hui’s true origin. The pet egg that Tao Tie entrusted to him was at least from over 10 thousand years ago, Qi Yue has also already existed since 10 thousand years ago. She might really know what Xiao Hui belongs to.</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s gaze lingered over Xiao Hui’s info. When she finished looking at its stats her expression did not change at all, but when her gaze landed on its ability information, her expression clearly froze many times, the depths of eye constantly flashing across bursts of surprise. Clearly being shocked about the powerful and extraordinary abilities Xiao Hui possesses.</p>
<p>“What can you tell?” When Qi Yue finished looking at Xiao Hui’s information, Ling Chen put away Xiao Hui’s stat page and directly asked.</p>
<p>Qi Yue was silent for a long time, seemingly thinking of something but in the end she still shook her head: “In my memory there is not any information regarding it. From what Tao Tie that big guy said, it should have a very big background, but the big guy was not willing to mention it to me. Should be that the beast that entrusted Xiao Hui to the big guy didn’t hope for its background to be revealed, and then it could live a bit more peacefully. Little master, after knowing of Xiao Hui’s abilities you should’ve understood how shocking its abilities are. Have you imagined what the result would be if its abilities are known by more and more people?</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…..!!” (TL: That’s new…)</p>
<p>An unbelievably tough body, peerless support ability… Soul Devour and refining abilities that make people amazed to the point that they are unable to believe it, and also able to accurately search for all kinds of high grade treasures! If Forgotten Continent’s people knew that this kind of creature existed, then no matter who they would all madly dream of obtaining it. After martial artists that chase after extreme strength obtain Xiao Hui, their strength will greatly increase, even skills that were originally unable to be upgraded can be easily upgraded. A regular martial artist can obtain all types of powerful items through its Soul Devour refining ability and have their strength rise explosively. After people that chase after great wealth obtain Xiao Hui, they can use it to easily find all kinds of rare treasure that they could only dream of before…</p>
<p>And these are also all just Xiao Hui’s initial abilities after just being born. If it fully matures then it’s practically unimaginable.</p>
<p>If Xiao Hui’s existence and the abilities it possesses were to be exposed to others, then the only result would be… It would bring about countless people of greed to come and rob him!!</p>
<p>“Have you thought clearly now?” Paying attention to Ling Chen’s expression, Qi Yue slowly said: “So, the beast that entrusted it to Tao Tie does not hope for its existence to be known by too many people. Or else, it will not have peace for its entire life and could even lose its life in the fight for it. Like that the bloodline of their clan could completely end.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was silent and then nodded his head: “It is indeed like that.”</p>
<p>“Although…” Qi Yue’s eyes slightly narrowed, an extremely attractive red blush appearing on her cheeks: “A portion of its abilities made me think of a creature that had already become extinct in a far-away time.”</p>
<p>“What?” Ling Chen asked.</p>
<p>“The beast of luck.”</p>
<p>“Beast of luck?”</p>
<p>“The Beast of luck is a very particular creature. It does not have any combat ability, but legend goes that if one can obtain the accompaniment of a beast of luck, then this person will always be accompanied by all kinds of big or small luck… Just like, little master finding the Sagittarius Orb this quickly, isn’t that exactly a kind of incredibly great luck?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…” (TL: And we’re back.)</p>
<p>“What is evil is the human heart. What brings humans war and disaster is their own greed, that has nothing to do with those creatures of luck that don’t have any combat ability and on the contrary give people good fortune.” Ling Chen said frowning.</p>
<p>“Amazingly said little master.” Qi Yue slightly pursed her lips, lightly nodding her head: “But the reality of the beasts of luck becoming extinct cannot be changed. As the messengers of god, if moon god oracles believe that they are correct, then they are definitely correct. How can humans go against the will of the Moon God. Since they say that the beasts of luck are wrong, then the beasts of luck are wrong. Since they want the beasts of luck to become extinct, then, the entire race of the beasts of luck will become extinct. It’s just that simple… This is the great moon god clan.”</p>
<p>Qi Yue laughed, but a deep light of coldness slightly flickered in the depths of her eyes.</p>
<p>Ling Chen was speechless for a time, not knowing what he should say. He’d alway faintly sensed that Qi Yue seemed to have a deep hatred towards the moon god clan. In addition this hatred doesn’t seem to be simply because of Lunar Scourge.</p>
<p>“Although, its appearance is not the same as the already extinct beasts of luck, a lot of abilities are also not what the beasts of luck possess. But if Doge really has the ability of the beasts of luck, heehee, then little master has gained an incredible treasure. Little master will have constant good fortune, Lunar Scourge’s orbs might not even need to be purposely looked for and will appear on their own.” Qi Yue’s beautiful eyes gently narrowed, when she spoke, a scent like jasmines and orchids gently kissed Ling Chen’s face making his entire body uncontrollably numb, his heart constantly rippling with the impulse to rip apart her black dress.</p>
<p>“Looks like, the big guy really gave little master a really big gift. Huu…” Finishing speaking, Qi Yue stretched her arms, lazily doing a stretch. This action of hers made the two breasts in front of her chest highly perked up, a wave of of up and down shaking along with her slender, delicate slim waist, snow-white, tender, round perky butt, smooth soft abdomen, graceful and beautiful well-proportioned legs, together drew out a curvaceous curve that made the blood pressure of people skyrocket. And then matched with her beautiful face that is enough to make all of the flowers in the world lose colour and the erotic seduction that she emits with her every movement, there really is not a single part of her that doesn’t make people driven to distraction.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s gaze uncontrollably landed on her highly perked up bosom, in his head the feeling and scenery that wouldn’t go away of holding them in his hands at that time… Qi Yue’s twin peaks were not only extremely plump and snow-white like jade, the shape of her breasts is also a perfect roundness. Snow-white and exquisite. Like having two bright, perfect full moons perched in front of her chest, the shape is too beautiful to be taken in all at once. And it just so happens that her slim waist that can be grasped with one arm, her waist delicate and soft like it was woven from fine fabric gave people the feeling of a type of gentle beauty making people want to embrace her in their arms and lovingly take care of her.</p>
<p>“Little master, you’re looking at my breasts and staring… Is it that you want to touch them again?” Ling Chen’s out of control gaze made Qi Yue’s smile become intimate. She took a step forward, her eyes smiling and her lips releasing a bewitching voice like the devil: “You’re my little master, however you treat me is okay…”</p>
<p>“Go back to Lunar Scourge, there’s none of your business here anymore.” Shifting his gaze away bit by bit in difficulty, Ling Chen closed his eyes, saying with a cold voice.</p>
<p>At an angle that Ling Chen cannot see, Qi Yue’s smile became a bit more mysterious. She pursed her lips, releasing a voice of grievance like that of a little girl acting in a pettishly charming manner: “Little master is shooing me away again… I am little master’s little slave, I will obey whatever little master says. Then I’m going back now to continue sleeping… Remember to think of me.”</p>
<p>Qi Yue did not stop any longer, the amount of time she can appear everyday added together is also only 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Everytime time Qi Yue appears is always a pretty big test on Ling Chen’s mind. After Qi Yue left, Ling Chen used a decent amount of time before completely stabilizing his mood. He then held up the teleportation scroll the Zephyr Bird dropped, lightly crushing it and disappearing on the spot together with Xiao Hui in a flash of white light.</p>
<p>When he appeared again, the surrounding light was a mass of greyness. This place was impressively the dark stone room that he was in when he first entered this trial ground.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Wow, my mind had the hardest time translating today for some reason. Anyways, here’s the chapter. And no, I did not leave anything out, the rest of the information will be continued next chapter.</p>
<p>Taking out the rusted key the Zephyr Bird dropped, Ling Chen walked towards that stone statue at the end of the stone room. On the stone statue is that locked metal chest. This key in my hand is really the key that can open this chest?</p>
<p>Standing in front of the stone statue, Ling Chen held up the key, inserting it into the metal chest’s only hole and then lightly turning it.</p>
<p>Sound of lock turning and then unlocking!</p>
<p>After a light sound, the tightly shut metal chest opened at the sound under Ling Chen’s gaze.</p>
<p>Success! Ling Chen shouted in his heart. The rusted key dropped by the Zephyr Bird is exactly the one that War God’s voice mentioned. Which also means that killing the Zephyr Bird is equivalent to passing the trial.</p>
<p>Opening the chest, Ling Chen was just about to go and see what was in the chest when a mass of dark coloured light accompanied by a strange aura suddenly came out from the chest making Ling Chen subconsciously take a few steps back.</p>
<p>The light released from the chest hovered in the air, gradually depicting the form of an aged old man’s upper body. The old man’s face is entirely unclear… It occurred to Ling Chen right away that this should be the image of War God during that time.</p>
<p>“Very good, a person has finally passed the trial I left behind… No, maybe I should say, someone has actually passed this trial.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…” (Someone has actually passed this trial… What does that mean!? Is it that you didn’t even prepare to let people pass this trial you set?)</p>
<p>“You’re probably very shocked about this line of mine, right? Hehe… Actually, if the me right now was still alive, I’d also be shocked that you actually passed this trial. This trial that even I did not think that anyone could pass. Because wanting a LV15 or below human to defeat a LV15 Celestial Beast under an extremely unfavorable environment is something that nobody would think could be done by a person. I believe that even the me of that time with extremely high talent would also be unable to do it at LV15 or below.</p>
<p>But, I still did not change the difficulty of the trial because I longed for a prodigy of extraordinary talent… A true genius that can break through the limits of a human to appear. Even though I did not know whether or not such a person would exist or appear, I still could not stop this longing of mine. Because only this kind of person has the possibility to accomplish the goal that I strived towards my entire life but did not achieve… Becoming the first human to reach Saint Destroyer.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“You’ve done it. I am unable to know what method you used, even if you had the help of some sort of powerful item or had incredible luck, you still did it in the end. I am very willing to pass on the power that I left behind at the end of my life to a prodigy like you. I believe that you will definitely use this power to the most extreme strength… And even surpass me. I am a martial arts extremist, my entire life I have been living to chase after the most extreme strength. I hope that the you who has inherited my strength will also be able to inherit and complete my dying wish, one day touching the Saint Destroyer level that human’s are unable to reach, becoming the true “War God” as the first human to break through the limits of humans!</p>
<p>In War God’s voice a grey coloured scroll slowly floated out from the chest, drifting in Ling Chen’s direction. Ling Chen reached out his arm, grabbing it in his hand.</p>
<p>“ This is the special scroll sealed with the last of my power. All you need to do is crush it and the power within will seep into your body becoming your own strength. But my power does not pass on to those of mediocrity, so this scroll can only be used in this space and cannot be given to a person after bringing it out. If you are above inheriting my strength then you can put back this scroll and then there will naturally be a force to send you away from here. After using this scroll sealed with the last of my strength, you will also possess the beginner profession that is the carrier of this power. I once named the ultimate form of this profession as “God Slayer”, because my entire life I have been striving to be able to reach the level of ‘slaying gods’. But this class name is great blasphemy towards the mighty ‘Moon God Clan’ so it cannot be actually used. But then again, what we chase after is powerful strength, what the profession is called in not important at all. You are about to change class to the beginner profession, let’s just have you name it yourself. I only desire for my strength to be able to help you reach the peak that I once dreamed to set foot on. Then, if you are willing to inherit my strength, then crush the scroll in your hand, let the last bit of my soul be able to feel my own strength being passed down.”</p>
<p>War God’s voice slowly died away, everything fell into silence. Ling Chen held the scroll in his hand… Saying this he wasn’t excited would be a lie. The Hall of Heroic Souls has been established for 1000 years, but never has there been a person able to obtain War God’s inheritance. In a thousand years, 6 stunning geniuses have even died in this trial. Before entering here, no matter if it was the class trainers or the guardian of the Hall of Heroic Souls, they all extremely seriously told him that he absolutely cannot choose this trial… This was simply a trial that could not be passed.</p>
<p>But under the powerful effect of “Soul Sacrifice”, under the blessing of fortune, he succeeded… Becoming the only person to pass War God’s trial after the appearance of the Hall of Heroic Souls! Right now, he is even holding War God inheritence power in his hands.</p>
<p>The Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian very assuredly replied to him that this will be one of the most powerful professions… Its power is superior to any one of the other 10 powerful hidden profession of The Hall of Heroic Souls.</p>
<p>[Hidden Profession Scroll — War God’s Inheritance]: Usage Requirements: Person approved by War God and can only be used in War God’s Trial Ground. After use will inherit War God’s strength changing class to the respective beginner profession. Profession name can be freely named, but due to the fact that this is power that originates from War God’s soul, you need to add the two words “Battle Soul” at the end of the profession. The general abilities and direction of this profession are unknown, but in War God’s life the most apex power was the greatest pursuit of his entire life, thus all his abilities walked the attack route, so this profession also walks the pure attack route, it almost does not touch upon any support or defense abilities.</p>
<p>A pure attack only route… No support or defense ability…</p>
<p>And is this not also exactly what Ling Chen has always been seeking! From the very start, Ling Chen put all of the AP gained from leveling up all into strength, not a single point was split to constitution or agility. The reason, is it not precisely to pursue the ultimates attack strength.</p>
<p>Not thinking anymore, he steadied his mind, slowly crushing the grey coloured scroll in his hand. Instantly, a mass of grey light spilt out from the crushed scroll, slowly landing on Ling Chen’s body and seeping into his body… A surge of raging power swept across every part of Ling Chen’s body…</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully received War God’s strength inheritance, about to change class to the new class, original class ‘Apprentice Warrior’ gone, original class skills ‘Full Power Strike’, ‘Crescent Slash’, and ‘Fire of Rage’ gone, please name the new class. Because the new power originates from War God’s soul, the two words ‘Battle Soul’ need to be added at the end of the profession. Class skills will also be named based on the self-designated class name.”</p>
<p>The arrival of a new class will definitely cause the original class to disappear, what disappears naturally also includes the class skills. “Full Power Strike”, “Crescent Slash” and “Fire of Rage” were all max level skills. just disappearing like this honestly made Ling Chen a bit pained, but… But the strongest profession according to the guardian of The Hall of Heroic Souls, no matter what its class skills should be stronger than the apprentice warrior’s, right.</p>
<p>“Ling… Tian…” Pondering for a short moment, Ling Chen shouted out his name in this world… The new class, he used his own name to name it.</p>
<p>“Ding… New profession ‘Ling Tian Battle Soul’ successfully named!”</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully changed class to the hidden profession ‘Ling Tian Battle Soul’, HP+220, MP+110, Physical Attack Strength+50, 4 big basic attributes+10, SP+100.”</p>
<p>In a flashing white light the new profession was successfully added to Ling Chen, he then extended his arms, silently feeling the power flowing through his entire body. “Ling Tian Battle Soul”, this is the new profession named after himself and is also the beginner class state of War God’s inherited power. The stats added when changing class made Ling Chen surprised and thrilled… Adding a whole 50 points of attack strength at once, this is the same as the attack strength added by a LV15 Gold grade weapon! It is the same as the attack strength temporarily added by a max level “Fire of Rage”! Each of the four basic attributes were increased by 10 points, a total of 40 points… The same as attribute points that can only be gained after consecutively levelling up 8 levels! After regular classes change classes they will usually all add a relatively large amount of HP and MP, the increase of attributes is very little. Who knows how many more times the attribute points added by War God’s profession is compared to regular professions.</p>
<p>Just this one point made Ling Chen clearly see the extreme strength of this class.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have successfully unlocked ‘Ling Tian Battle Soul’s’ class skills: ‘War God Technique’, ‘Ling Tian Slash’, ‘Ling Tian Burst’, ‘Four Corners Star Formation’, ‘Battle Soul Possession’.”</p>
<p>Following the notification sound sounding up again, “Ling Tian Battle Soul’s” class information page automatically appeared in front of Ling Chen.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Warning, content in here that could potentially lead to 18+ content if you search for it. Viewer discretion is not really advised. And yeah I accidentally posted this again. Who knew pressing enter would do that. I need to learn to set the time and date first before I do anything else.</p>
<p>[Four Corners Star Formation]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV10, SP required to upgrade to LV2: 300. Using the power of the battle soul to sweep the surroundings, instantly forming a formation of destruction in a 10 meter radius around yourself.

<p>At the same time as the new class was added it also unlocked 5 whole abilities. One passive, four active. Truly the class originating from War God, every skill is so powerful that they make people’s eyes pop. War God Technique can increase strength and attack with the upgrading of his level, moreover the max level of this War God Technique is LV10, if it reaches max level then its effect will definitely be cheat level, even not below the ancient battle technique “Heaven Wind Technique” that he possesses. Ling Tian Slash is a powerful single target attack, under a LV1 state its lethality is already superior to the max level Full Power Strike. Ling Tian Burst is a group attack, even though under a LV1 state its power is inferior to a max level Crescent Slash, the number of attack targets is not limited, moreover the initial area is already able to envelop the frontal 5 meter area. Four Corners Star Formation is a powerful AOE attack. It is also the battle soul profession’s unique skill. At the initial state it is already able to envelop a 10 meter area around him, the damage is not inferior to Shooting Soaring Cloud. If it reaches max level, how terrifying the damage would be is practically unimaginable. The last skill “Battle Soul Possession”… Imagine it, Soul Sacrifice matched with Battle Soul Possession and then an ultimate skill, how terrifying of a damage value would that deal. If a critical hit also appears, then it might even be able to insta-kill a Lord boss of the same level!</p>
<p>The battle soul profession’s powerfulness made Ling Chen amazed, but at the same time the stronger the profession, the harder its class skills are to upgrade.</p>
<p>The upgrade points for the three attack skills are a lot greater compared to the common skill upgrade points of regular classes and the level cap of the 3 skills are all as high as LV10. Who knows how many skill points need to be expended to reach max level. War God Technique and Battle Soul Possession both require SP in the thousands to upgrade from the initial level to LV2!</p>
<p>When Ling Chen just finished looking through all of the battle soul profession’s skills, a notification sound suddenly rose up beside his ears:</p>
<p>“Ding… Under the effect of your pet ‘Holy Spirit Beast’ Sasha Grey’s innate skill ‘Holy Spirit Gift’ your skills ‘War God Technique ‘, ‘Ling Tian Slash’, ‘Ling Tian Burst’, ‘Four Corners Star Formation’, ‘Battle Soul Possession’ have all upgraded to LV2.” (TL: Yeah, someone suggested that in the “Others” of the poll and I couldn’t resist, don’t worry, it’s just for fun. I had a good laugh, thank you whoever suggested this. Btw, don’t search her up unless you’re 18+… at least don’t watch any videos.)</p>
<p>[War God Technique]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level, LV10, SP required to upgrade to LV3: 2000. Powerful battle technique originating from War God’s soul force, after practise can greatly increase personal attack strength permanently.

<p>[Ling Tian Slash]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level, LV10, SP required to upgrade to LV3: 400.

<p>[Four Corners Star Formation]: Current Level: LV2, Highest Level: LV10, SP required to upgrade to LV3: 500. Using the power of the battle soul to sweep the surroundings, instantly forming a formation of destruction in a 10 meter radius around yourself. The raging battle soul power will deal devastating damage towards all targets within the formation. Damage is equal to 350% of regular damage, Critical Hit Rate+5%, 100% chance to trigger knock back, MP Consumption: 100, Cooldown Time: 60 secs.</p>

Igniting the battle soul, releasing all of your strength causing you next attack to possess the most extreme destructive power. Effect: Damage+100% for next attack, MP Consumption: 50, Cooldown Time: 30 secs.</p>
<p>Towards skills gained in the future, Xiao Hui’s “Holy Spirit Gift” will directly take effect directly upgrading all of Ling Chen’s battle soul skills to LV2. The power the the three upgraded attack skills all increased, the strength value and attack strength added by War God Technique greatly increased… And Battle Soul Possession, even though the SP required to upgrade it is the most, upgrading one time made its effect increase by a whole fold!</p>
<p>“Very good, I can sense that you have already successfully inherited the power that I left behind. I am very gratified. I hope my power can let you become another ‘War God’, I also believe that with you talent you can grow the strength that I left behind to a level that surpasses me.”</p>
<p>The old voice slowly died away, the figure floating above the metal chest also became a lot fainter. Right when Ling Chen thought that the last of War God’s soul was about to fade away, another item slowly floated out from within the metal chest. This is a black coloured item, the shape is irregular, at the same time the old voice once again rose up…</p>
<p>“Human that has inherited my strength, lastly, I have an item to give you… This is an item that has no use towards you… and has no use towards anybody, but is my most important item in my life. I hope that you can take good care of it in my place… Even though it really can’t do anything to help you and could instead bring calamity to you.”</p>
<p>In War God’s voice that black item slowly floated to the front of Ling Chen. Ling Chen extended his arms grabbing it in his hands… The instant it entered his hands, an unexpected heavy weight overcame him. Ling Chen’s two arms abruptly dropped, with a “Bam” this black item that just touched his hands has already fallen onto the ground, even smashing a deep hole in the ground.</p>
<p>So heavy… What is this! Ling Chen was astonished, when it just entered his hands the heavy feeling beyond expectations made him simply unable to hold it steadily. Ling Chen crouched down, examining this black item on the ground. Only when he got close by did he notice that it was not a pure black colour. The black colour was also covered with a layer of dark red, this kind of heavy dark red made him think of the colour of high density blood after it’s dried. (TL: High density as in lots of red blood cells… I think at least.)</p>
<p>The form of its left and right sides are straight, hiding a sharpness, the top and bottom parts are a slight saw shape, very irregular… At first glance, it’s like one of the parts of the sword blade of a giant sword after being broken into many pieces.</p>
<p>Completely useless towards me, but is War God’s most valuable treasure in his life… What could this be?</p>
<p>[Shura Emperor Sword Broken Piece 2]: …</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!”</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>“Hehe, as you see, this is a portion of the sword blade of a sword after it’s been broken. The sword that it belongs to is called “Shura Emperor Sword’ you definitely have not heard of this name before. At this day there also shouldn’t be that many people that still remember this name. This sword was once the strongest sword ever that shook the world, the amount of life that has died from it… is at a point that you simply cannot imagine. The reason it was able to grow to become the strongest sword, is because it drank too much, too much blood. That number is enough to make true gods deeply tremble. And this strongest sword, belongs to history’s strongest person. His strength exceeds your imagination. Even though the him of that time could already no longer be called human, but his nature was actually still a human… His name was… Shura.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“Now the number of people that still remember the name Shura are already very few, people that know that he used the “Shura Emperor Sword” to massacre the world are even fewer. Shura perished 10 thousand years ago, Shura Emperor Sword also perished with him, never to reappear again. I spent my entire life, going through untold hardships before finding one of the pieces of the Shura Emperor Sword… This is also the only item I’ve obtained that comes from Shura. Even though… what Shura brought to the world was great disaster and he was thousands of millions of times scarier than the devil, but the strength that he possessed was something that even gods feared. That is truly being strong… Strength enough to look down on the world and defy the heavens! That is also the goal of me this martial arts extremist that I’ve longed for even until death. But sadly, until the day that I died, the distance between me and him was still that of night and day. I may have been called ‘War God’, but compared to Shura I couldn’t even be considered a firefly under the sun and moon. I have always been stashing this broken piece, never letting other people know and also not daring to let other people know. If it is accidently known by the moon god clan, it might bring about the punishment of destruction. But I would rather risk bearing the danger of being punished by the Moon God than throw it away… Because it is the Shura Emperor Sword of the past. Shura is the person that I most admired in my life, at the same time… he is also my ancestor…”</p>
<p>Ancestor? This War God whose name shook all of Forgotten World in the past… Is actually the descendant of that Shura?</p>
<p>“To chase after the pinnacle that my ancestor once reached, I was infatuated with the martial path my entire life. From small I left my family, at middle age I had already forgotten who my parents even were, I especially wouldn’t have descendants. This piece of ancestor’s sword was the only mental support in my life, even if I lost my life I wouldn’t abandon it… And the only one who I can entrust it with, is also only you. Ancestor’s sword has already been destroyed, never to reappear again. I hope the you who has inherited my strength can take care of it for me, do not let even the last trace of ancestor having existed in this world vanish…”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Even though he knows that this is just the spirit voice left behind by War God and no matter what Ling Chen says he will not hear it, he still promised aloud. He then put away the Shura Emperor Sword’s broken piece into his bag… The Shura Emperor Sword, the once strongest sword, and I have consecutively obtained two pieces of this sword’s broken pieces in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Is this also good luck brought by Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>But what made Ling Chen astonished is that the last of War God’s soul seems to still have an active consciousness, actually understanding his words and responding: “Very good, thank you for willingly risking the danger of being punished by the moon god clan and safekeeping it for me… My remaining time is already very little, let me send you away now. I believe that one day Forgotten Continent will tremble because of you.”</p>
<p>War God’s voice became completely fuzzy, a mass of light green light wrapped Ling Chen’s body, carrying him and slowly disappearing in this space.</p>
<p>Right at the instant when Ling Chen and War God’s silhouette were about to disappear at virtually the same time, a confused and shaky voice suddenly travelling into his ears: “Wait.. This power on your body…”</p>
<p>The space switched, Ling Chen finally completely left War God’s trial ground, what travelled into his ears seemed to be War God’s voice, but it also seemed to be just an illusion.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yeah, so you guys probably see that donate page on the menu bar. I’ve changed my mind and decided to accept donations again. I know what you guys are thinking, but I am only human. Donations are just for if you appreciate what I’m doing and feel that a simple thank you is not enough. Anyways, here is the chapter.</p>
<p>In the hollow Hall of Heroic Souls, the Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian was in the middle of spacing out looking at the pillar in the very middle. This is because just now the light of this pillar suddenly dimmed, and in a short few seconds of time it lost all colour. And then, the entire pillar started to become illusionary, like it could disappear at any time.</p>
<p>This kind of situation only appears after the power within the pillar has been inherited! And this middle pillar… Is it, that person, he actually…</p>
<p>While he was deeply bewildered in disbelief, Ling Chen’s body slowly appeared in front of the middle pillar in a circle of warm light. At the same time, the Hall of Heroic Souls’ middle pillar bearing War God’s power also completely disappeared… Vanishing without a trace.</p>
<p>“You…” Looking at Ling Chen who was standing in front of him again, this previously cold person to the point that he practically didn’t have any emotions was actually so shocked that he couldn’t speak.</p>
<p>“My choice was not wrong, War God’s trial, I passed it!” Ling Chen grinned, saying to him.</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t need to explain, him being able to be teleported here and the disappearance of the middle pillar were all iron-clad proof. The guardian of the Hall of Heroic Souls started to reevaluate the young man before his eyes, remembering his appearance and special features in his heart. Before Ling Chen entered the trial, he used his own method to give him help hoping for him to be able to pass this trial that no one had passed in 1000 years. But in the depths of his heart, he was still unable to believe that Ling Chen could actually pass. Because the strength that Ling Chen displayed was honestly too weak, all of the prodigies that died in War God’s trial in the past were all far superior to him.</p>
<p>But the result, so shockingly appeared before him. War God’s power that lingered in the Hall of Heroic Souls for 1000 years, at today was finally able to be passed on. The person that inherited it, is also an otherworld human who has only come to this world and matured for a couple days!</p>
<p>And thinking of him being approved by all 11 powers, the scene at that time caused him to still be in shock even right now.</p>
<p>This is a man with such an astounding talent and future!</p>
<p>“You created a miracle.” He opened his mouth saying. He thought for a long time but he could only say this kind of feeble sentence.</p>
<p>Ling Chen lightly smiled, saying sincerely: “This is thanks to your help, or else I would have already died many times in the trial.” Finishing speaking he took out the Celestial Aqua Scale the Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian gave him. The Celestial Aqua Scale that can be used 5 times for protection has already been used 4 times by Ling Chen with just the last chance remaining. At the same time, the help that he gave Ling Chen was not just a Celestial Aqua Scale. If not for the “Spirit Shield Orb” he gave him, Ling Chen didn’t know when he would be able to hatch Xiao Hui and he especially would not have obtained the Sagittarius Orb… Defeating the Zephyr Bird would have then become an impossible task.</p>
<p>The black-clothed person’s gaze scanned the Celestial Aqua Scale, slowly saying: “This is something I gained when I killed an Aqua Fish King. It being able to achieve this kind of effect can be considered its honour. War God is the publically accepted strongest human in human history, even though your strength belongs to the player level that is at the very bottom of the scale, but being able to obtain his power inheritance I believe that one day you will stand at the peak of all of Forgotten Continent. Just like now, you who is a player has already completed a task that Forgotten Continent’s countless geniuses have been unable to accomplish in 1000 years.”</p>
<p>His voice pausing, the black-clothed person looked towards the middle pillar that had already vanished, saying: “I didn’t think that I would actually be able to personally see War God’s strength being passed on, this could also be considered my honour. Young man, take this.”</p>
<p>A wide-bladed greatsword appeared in the black-clothed person’s hand, handing it over to Ling Chen: “This is the sword of War God, it was once known by the entire world. It accompanied War God for hundreds of years and had already developed spirituality. After War God passed on, it also followed War God and left, dispersing all of its strength and turning into a completely regular sword. Take this sword and then go and see the mayor, this will be your proof of passing War God’s trial. The mayor once said that if a person can pass War God’s trial then to notify him at the first moment. Also, when you go see the mayor, bring this note over to him too. He is currently being distressed by a difficult matter, this War God’s Sword and this note might give him confidence to hand this matter over to you… If you really can complete it then the mayor will remember your kindness and will generously repay you. This will be a great help for you being in Forgotten Continent.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen took over War God’s Sword and the note at the same time.</p>
<p>[War God’s Sword]: Type: Two-handed sword, Grade: Pale White, Equipment Requirements: Cannot equip. The sword of Forgotten Continents once most powerful War God, because of unknown reasons it has lost all of its strength. Cannot be equipped. Attribute: Attack Strength+5.</p>
<p>[Hall of Heroic Souls’ Guardian’s Note]: A note written by the Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian, please give it to the Azure Dragon mayor, will directly disappear after discarding it.</p>
<p>“Those seven people have been waiting outside the whole time, you should go see them and then have them bring you to go see the mayor. I need to guard here and cannot leave.” The Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian calmly said.</p>
<p>Ling Chen did not say anything else, putting away War God’s Sword and the note, walking in the direction of the Hall of Heroic Souls exit.</p>
<p>At the Hall of Heroic Souls’ door, the seven class trainers were already about to fall asleep.</p>
<p>“Strange, why is there still no movement, say something if he’s alive or dead.”</p>
<p>“Logically speaking, the inheritance of strength should be very quick, no matter what it shouldn’t drag on for this long.”</p>
<p>“Say you guys, could he have lost his sense for a moment and really chosen that one in the middle?”</p>
<p>“Impossible! I expressly told him to absolutely not pick that middle one… Unless his brain has been caught by a door.</p>
<p>“The other strength inheritances can be completed in a moment, only War God’s power requires one to go through a trial. Right now it’s already been so long, no matter how you look at it, it’s all like…”</p>
<p>“Fuck! Has that boy’s head been kicked by a donkey!! He may have astounding talent, but that trial is absolute bullshit. So many super prodigies of Forgotten Continent have all died within that trial, just that bit of strength of his…”</p>
<p>Creak…</p>
<p>Behind their backs, the Hall of Heroic Souls’ door was pushed open. Ling Chen walked out from within with a helpless face, he heard everything that they just said.</p>
<p>Seeing him the seven class trainers all charged over, like a group of noisy flies asking about the matter of Ling Chen’s strength inheritance in a gabble. Before they finished speaking a low and cold voice travelled out from within the Hall of Heroic Souls: “Those who create a racket outside of the Hall of Heroic Souls — Death!”</p>
<p>The seven class trainers were instantly silent, each of them shrinking their necks, grabbing Ling Chen and running in the direction of the class change hall.</p>
<p>Finally walking out of the area of the Hall of Heroic Souls, the seven class trainers once again surrounded him, impatiently asking: “Kid, how is it? What class did you change to?”</p>
<p>“He, from the looks of it you should have succeeded. Good thing you weren’t an idiot and didn’t choose War God’s trial, or else right now you wouldn’t be coming out from the Hall of Heroic Souls but instead over at the revival stone. You’d also never have a chance to change classes in the Hall of Heroic Souls in this life… Hurry up and say, whose power did you gain?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen shrugged his shoulders, leisurely saying: “Of course it’s… War God’s power.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit!” The moment Ling Chen’s sentence left his mouth the warrior trainer directly swore. That expression was like he wanted to start yelling at him. Ling Chen quickly took two steps back, dodging a swarm of spit that flew over.</p>
<p>“Do you think you’re some big shot after gaining a strength inheritance, actually starting mess with us couple of old guys! You’ve gained War God’s power? Ptui, if you can obtain War God’s power inheritance I’ll walk upside down from now on!” The warrior trainer roared grinding his teeth.</p>
<p>“Kid, do you know what you first need to do to inherit War God’s power… It is a trial of strength!! In these 1000 years, a total of six people have entered that trial, not a single person passed and they all instead died within. Any of those six people could causally poke you to death with a pinky finger. You’ve gained War God’s inheritance? And I’m the father of the mayor!”</p>
<p>“If you can pass War God’s trial then I’ll cut off my head for you to use as a urinal!”</p>
<p>“Kid, one must be honest, you need to make a draft when bluffing!”</p>
<p>Looking at the faces of disdain on the class trainers, there was actually no one that believed him. Ling Chen couldn’t help but be saddened, he twitched his lips, his hand moving and holding War God’s Sword in his hand.</p>
<p>When War God’s Sword appeared, the expressions of the seven class trainers froze, even the air completely froze at this moment. 7 pairs of differently sized eyes all froze on it, their eyes all widening to the limit at virtually the same time, trembling with a light of disbelief.</p>
<p>“This… this is….”</p>
<p>“War God’s Sword!! It’s War God’s Sword, no mistake!”</p>
<p>“War God’s Sword can only be given to the person that obtains War God’s inheritance, could… Could it be…”</p>
<p>Seven pairs of class trainer eyes focused on Ling Chen’s body again, that extremely exaggerated expression was like looking at a monster. War God’s Sword is the proof of passing War God’s trial. They understand clearly that Ling Chen being able to obtain this War God’s Sword clearly means… He, really passed War God’s trial, obtaining the inheritance of War God’s strength.</p>
<p>The warrior trainer started to speak in a stutter: “Yyyyyy you… You really obtained War God’s strength? The time before, you were accepting War God’s trial!?”</p>
<p>“That’s right, you guys can choose to believe me or not.” Ling Chen put away War God’s Sword, not bothering to say anything more.</p>
<p>“By my mother, it’s actually true!!” The seven class trainers all wailed in their hearts. This otherworld human in front of them that has only arrived in the world for a couple of days has actually passed this trial that no one has passed in 1000 years on Forgotten Continent. Is there something more unbelievable than this? But, that War God’s Sword is iron-clad proof.</p>
<p>This person… Is he a monster?</p>
<p>“Yes… Yes… We definitely believe you.” The warrior trainer blankly nodded his head like a little chick pecking rice, evidently having difficulty returning to his senses from the shock: “Truly… Truly the person that unlocked Soul sacrifice. You are a prodigy… No, a prodigy among prodigies.”</p>
<p>“Cough cough.” Ling Chen slanted his eyes, saying in a leisurely manner: “Mister warrior trainer, I heard that you have to walk upside down from now on?”</p>
<p>The warrior trainer’s expression froze and then looked at the sky at a 45 degree angle, rubbing his head and laughing like a lunatic: “Ha, haha… The weather today is nice, really nice, haha… haha…”</p>
<p>“Mister shield-guard trainer, I heard you are the mayor’s dad?”</p>
<p>The shield-guard trainer’s face was completely serious: “Hallucinations, you’re definitely hallucinating.”</p>
<p>“Mister archer trainer, I heard you’re going to chop off your head to let me use as a urinal?”</p>
<p>The archer trainer opened wide his innocent eyes, asking with a face of confusion: “What are urinals? Can you eat them?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When he logged out from the Mystic Moon world the sky outside was already bright. He originally could have let the seven class trainers directly take him to go see the Azure Dragon mayor, but he was concerned about Shui Ruo so he still decided to go offline. The matter of seeing the Azure Dragon mayor can wait until the next time he logs on.</p>
<p>Today Shui Ruo woke up very early. When Ling Chen awakened Shui Ruo was lying on his body, secretly kissing his face. Seeing his eyes open she smiled sweetly. Everytime he sees Shui Ruo’s smile he will always feel that his heart is virtually about to completely melt.</p>
<p>“Brother, look…”</p>
<p>Under Ling Chen’s gaze, Shui Ruo’s arms slightly pushed on the bed and then her body slowly sat up on the bed. The entire process appeared so easy and natural, there was not a single trace of strain or struggle. Even though Shui Ruo could also sit up on her own before, every time she had to expend a lot of effort, she was simply unable to sit up so easily.</p>
<p>This meant that Shui Ruo’s body functions really already had a very evident improvement. The 13223 drug completely took effect.</p>
<p>“This is great Shui Ruo. Like this, in at most one month you’ll be able to completely recover!” Ling Chen lightly said, his heart slowly being filled with warmth and joy. Shui Ruo’s recovery is the greatest desire in his life… And now, this previous wild wish has already genuinely appeared before his eyes. Looking at the current Shui Ruo, he distinctly felt that his life was already very perfect… Really so perfect. As long as Shui Ruo can completely recover, he already has no more desires.</p>
<p>“I definitely will.” Ling Shui Ruo heavily nodded her head: “Not only my body, my mind has also recovered very well. Just like today, I can wake up this early and I don’t feel tired at all! Brother, I feel like I can play games together with you right now, there shouldn’t be any problems.”</p>
<p>“That’s no good.” Ling Chen smiled shaking his head: “Playing virtual reality games requires one to exhaust their mind. Regular people are unaffected, but with your current condition you should still spend all your energy resting. Wait for a little longer, okay?”</p>
<p>When Ling Chen is in the game world, after Ling Shui Ruo wakes up she will always silently watch him by his side. Even though they have been together for so many year, she can still never get enough of watching him.</p>
<p>She sees that the expression of her brother while he is in the game world is always so serious, he’s definitely doing everything very seriously in that world, which also means… He really likes that game world. She really also wants to go to that mysterious game world to accompany him and help him.</p>
<p>“Ok, I’ll listen to brother.” Shui Ruo’s slender eyebrows slightly raised, smiling very sweetly.</p>
<p>After eating breakfast with Shui Ruo, when he was just about to push Shui Ruo out to feel the morning breeze, the phone in the house suddenly rang.</p>
<p>Due to the reason of Shui Ruo having Isrock, Ling Chen used to never use cellphones this kind of thing. Now he does have one, it is one that Yun Feng forcefully shoved to him when he delivered the game equipment. The house has always had a very old-style landline and the number of people that know the number of this landine is also one… It is Dr. Ma who has always been treating Shui Ruo’s Isrock.</p>
<p>Pickin up the phone, it was indeed the voice of that doctor that came out: “Mr. Ling Chen, is it convenient for you to bring your sister over to my place here? It’s related to the matter of her condition, there are some things I have to confirm… This is very important.”</p>
<p>The last time they went to Dr. Ma’s, the result they obtained was that the majority of the Isrock virus in Shui Ruo’s body has become dormant. At that time this result made her very shocked, she was simply unable to believe it. Yet that result made Ling Chen and Shui Ruo smile, at that time Ling Chen also said: “I think we probably won’t be coming here anymore.”</p>
<p>“Please be sure to come.” Not waiting for Ling Chen to ask, the doctor on the other side had already hung up the phone. Ling Chen held onto the phone and frowned.</p>
<p>After contemplating Ling Chen still pushed Shui Ruo walking in the direction of the hospital. Even the he does not understand Dr. Ma’s objective, Dr. Ma is a person that can be trusted. This point he can more than confirm or else he also wouldn’t allow her to treat Shui Ruo. At the same time, he didn’t dare to have any carelessness related to Shui Ruo’s condition.</p>
<p>Arriving at the hospital, Dr. Ma did not immediately say the objective of their arrival, instead having the nurse do a blood test on Shui Ruo at the first moment. After a bit the test result was sent to Dr. Ma’s hands. Dr. Ma looked at the pictures and test report in her hands, silent for a long time.</p>
<p>“Doctor, is there a special problem?” Ling Chen asked.</p>
<p>Putting down the things in her hands, Dr. Ma turned her face over, her expression carrying a hint of complexity. She pushed the spectacle frame on the bridge of her nose, saying seriously: “Looking at the test result, Shui Ruo’s Isrock virus is already completely dormant, not a single one is still active. Moreover from the looks of it they will be dormant for a very long time. Which is to say, before these Isrock viruses awaken, Shui Ruo will not receive any influences from them. She only needs to then go through conventional recuperations and she will very quickly recover to be the same as a regular person… No, it should be even better than a regular human. What’s dormant is not only the Isrock virus, any viruses in Shui Ruo’s body that is harmful to her body have all fallen dormant like the Isrock virus, some have even directly died. Under this kind of condition, Shiu Ruo will not become sick due to the infection of a virus.”</p>
<p>“… Dr. Ma, do you have something else you want to say?” Ling Chen did not did not display any joy. When Dr. Ma called him her tone of voice was clearly unusual. When saying these words her expression also had an evident change.</p>
<p>Dr. Ma looked at him and then looked at Shui Ruo beside him, saying: “Tell me honestly, did you give her the 13223 drug?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s forehead slightly wrinkled, after staring at Dr. Ma’s eyes for a few seconds he still nodded his head.</p>
<p>“That’s what I thought.” Dr. Ma lightly breathed out, and then turned her body half-way, speaking while facing the computer screen: “The last time you guys came Shui Ruo’s test results made me very surprised. From your behaviour that didn’t seem to be the mistake of the test result. Thus I used a lot of time to investigate the reason this kind of situation would appear and respectively consulted the entire world’s leading Irsock virus specialists. And then I knew about the 13223 drug this thing. Currently, it is also only it that can make the Isrock virus so quickly fall dormant in a large-scale. To confirm this I called you guys over today… The reality is indeed so.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell people this.” Ling Chen said without expression.</p>
<p>“I know.” Dr. Ma smiled: “I also wanted to remind you guy not to tell other people this. Looks like it’s unnecessary. After all, there’s only a limited few bottles of the 13223 drug in the entire word, a lot of people are doing everything possible to obtain it. If other people know that you guys have used it, it might bring you guys trouble. Rest assured, I will not tell anyone about this. I swear by my honour.”</p>
<p>“Ok, I believe you. Then the reason you called us over today is to confirm the matter of the 13223 drug?” Ling Chen asked. Is it really just like so? But based on his intuition it also didn’t seem to be so simple. Because this Dr. Ma’s expression was mixed with some things he couldn’t see.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Dr. Ma nodded her head, smiling gently: “Studying the Isrock virus for so many years I actually didn’t know of the existence of the 13223 drug this kind of thing the entire time. This made me feel like a failure. Encountering it for the first time my occupational enthusiasm made me uncontrollably want to personally see the effect of the 13223 drug. I am truly sorry for having you guys come over here because of my selfishness. To show my apologies, if Shui Ruo has any minor illnesses in the future then feel free to come find me, you don’t need to pay any medical fees… Even though Shui Ruo might not get anymore illnesses anymore, hehe.”</p>
<p>“In that case, then I will first leave with Shui Ruo and come trouble you again in the future. Good-bye.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye Aunt Ma, I will think of you.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye. Shui Ruo, I hope you can be happy like an angel.”</p>
<p>Watching Ling Chen and Shui Ruo leave, Dr. Ma’s expression became complex and hard to describe. Some things she was simply unable to say.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of the computer, she lifted her finger, clicking on a video that she’d already repeatedly watched many times…</p>
<p>The video opening, what it projected was a small conference room, and the people sitting in the conference room were all surprisingly the world’s authority level specialists in studying the Isrock virus.</p>
<p>“Through many years of unremitting efforts, we’ve finally figured out the core components of the 13223 drug… Initially we thought this would be a massive historical breakthrough in humanity fighting the Isrock virus. When the 13223 drug could be mass produced and widespread, the Isrock virus would no longer be that scary because the 13223 drug can make them dormant for 10 years. After 10 years we might be already able to completely overcome the Isrock virus.</p>
<p>“But, this beautiful vision has shattered. When we discovered the core components of the 13223 drug, what we felt was not joy, but instead fear.”</p>
<p>“Because, the 13223 drug is actually a type of poison… A type of poison even scarier than the Isrock virus. The reason it can cause the Isrock virus to fall dormant, is because its overly terrifying poisonousness makes even the Isrock virus feel afraid and forced to hide itself for self-protection. On the appearance, it’s holding back the Isrock virus and it can be for as long as 10 years, because after this virus enters the human body, it can also only live for 10 years. But… In the end it is a poison even scarier than the Isrock virus. It is like a deadly venomous snake, a hibernating venomous snake. Maybe, it will continue to stay dormant, dormant until the day that it dies. Then fortunately, its host will peacefully pass these 10 years. But once it awakens, the body that it exists in will only have one result…”</p>
<p>“Within three days… Death.”</p>
<p>“At the moment, there are already 7 people in the entire world that are known to have taken the 13223 drug. We spent a large amount of time and effort to find their current conditions. The results made us shaken… Of the 7 people, 2 people peacefully passed the 10 years, the other 5 people, 2 inexplicably died after 5 years, 2 inexplicably died at around 1 year, and 1, after taking the 13223 drug the person’s body completely recovered but inexplicably died one month later… And only we know the true reason they died.”</p>
<p>“The 13223 virus is a terrifying gamble, its appearance can even said to be a terrifying scam! It absolutely cannot be widespread, and even needs to be prohibited!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Cheeeeeeeese… Yeah I have nothing to say. But cheese is very delicious.</p>
<p>“Dr. Ma, can Ruo Ruo touch virtual reality games in her current condition?”</p>
<p>“Looking at her current condition it is entirely okay. The current virtual reality worlds have already become extremely perfect and humane, just like the current ‘Mystic Moon’. After entering the game the exhaustion of a person’s mind is incredibly small, practically approaching a state of slumber. So even if a person is immersed inside 24 hours a day they only need to replenish the necessary nutrients on time and it will not have a big influence on the human body. Right now even though Ruo Ruo has yet to fully recover, staying in the game 8 hours a day is entirely no problem.”</p>
<p>“Okay, thank you Dr. Ma.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. Actually, you already don’t need to protect her like she’s a porcelain doll. Letting her exercise more and training her mind will instead help her recover faster. Also… Do your best to satisfy her requests… What I mean is, if she’s in a good mood it is very beneficial to recovery of her body and mind</p>
<p>“Ok, I know.”</p>
<p>“Ya!!” Seeing Ling Chen hang up the phone, Ling Shui Ruo made a victory sign with her hand while laughing: “Brother, this time it’s my win!”</p>
<p>“Fine.” Ling Chen helplessly shrugged his shoulders, but he was actually warmly laughing in his heart. Because this at least proves that Ling Shui Ruo’s mind has indeed already recovered very well. He took out Shui Ruo’s game device — It is an aqua blue coloured crystal bracelet. Pulling over Shui Ruo’s smooth soft hand he gently put it onto her white wrists. Shui Ruo’s skin is overly snow-white and delicate, everytime when Ling Chen touches her skin he will always be very careful, afraid of hurting her.</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo lifted her hand looking at the beautiful game device on her wrist, smiling happily. Like this she can also accompany him at all times in the other world.</p>
<p>“But you need to remember, you can’t go past 8 hours a day.”</p>
<p>“I know brother.” Ling Shui Ruo stuck out her pink tongue, a casual playful action yet it was so cute that it made Ling Chen dazzled.</p>
<p>“Then, Ruo Ruo, what class are you going to choose?”</p>
<p>“Brother is a profession that mains attack, of course I’m a priest. Like this brother will be able to reassuredly fight at the front and I can protect brother from the back…Always being protected brother, I also want to protect brother once.”</p>
<p>“Ok, priest… Then what name does Ruo Ruo prepare to use?”</p>
<p>“This… is a secret!”</p>
<p>Closing the door he lied together on their big bed with Shui Ruo. The first time they will enter the game world together. Ling Chen looked at the girl sticking beside him with her eyes closed, for him her smiling face will always the the most valuable thing and most beautiful scenery in the world… There is nothing more valuable than Shui Ruo’s smiling face. The him today is honestly really happy.</p>
<p>His hand pressing on the game device, after a short silence Ling Chen had already returned to the game world.</p>
<p>“Ding… Welcome to the Mystic Moon world, we hope you have a joyful experience.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen appeared in a location very close to the Hall of Heroic Souls, this is also the place where he logged out yesterday. He directly ran in the direction of the class change hall.</p>
<p>Since Ling Chen appeared in Azure Dragon City until know, there still hasn’t been a second player who has entered the class change hall. In the later stages levels will be gradually pulled apart due to profession, gear, skills, items and other various aspects, but at the early stage where everyone has the exact same starting point, pulling apart such a great distance is indeed a bit exaggerated. The class change hall was desolate, it was still only just those seven class trainers. They saw Ling Chen come in and immediately surrounded him like wolves that hadn’t eaten meat for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Take me to go see the mayor?” Ling Chen said straight to the point.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon City is very big, there are countless NPCs inside, and on these countless NPCs there definitely also hides countless tasks of all sorts. But the rewards given by these regular quests that can be directly accepted are also naturally some regular rewards… Either potions or money or experience. More generous ones will give low grade energy crystals or low grade equipment. These things have a great allure towards regular players, for them doing quests is a lot more important than farming and leveling up. But with Ling Chen’s current equipment he clearly isn’t foolish enough to waste a bunch of time to go earn those non essential rewards.</p>
<p>The location of the mayor’s residence is slightly north of the center of Azure Dragon City and is a forbidden area towards players. If there wasn’t someone special leading him Ling Chen simply would not be allowed to enter.</p>
<p>And so, the class trainers with nothing to do brought Ling Chen over to the mayor’s residence. These seven class trainers are evidently famous people within Azure Dragon City, the line-up of the seven trainers leading a youngster walking on the streets of Azure Dragon City also stood out quite a lot. Bearing the gazes of countless people they finally arrived in front of the door of the mayor’s residence. The warrior trainer took a step forward, saying towards the city guards guarding there: “Please notify the mayor, just say the the first otherworld person has already arrive and has obtained the strength inheritance from the Hall of Heroic Souls. We’ve already brought him to see the mayor.”</p>
<p>The gazes of the city guards guarding at the of the door immediately all focused on Ling Chen, their faces revealing a deep admiration and respect. People that can obtain the Hall of Heroic Souls’ strength inheritance are all once in a hundred year geniuses. After they mature they are all reputed figures. The expression of the city guards immediately became respectful, nodding his head he quickly entered the mayor’s residence. In a bit he then hastily returned, saying towards them: “The mayor said he only wants to see this player that passed the Hall of Heroic Souls’ trial and told me to tell the seven trainers to keep post and not to casually leave. This hero from another world, please follow me.”</p>
<p>The seven class trainers immediately all became awkward, only able to stare at Ling Chen walk into the mayor’s residence by himself.</p>
<p>The mayor’s residence is by no means a place that regular players can enter, but people with strong talent and ability will always enjoy special treatment no matter where they go. Azure Dragon City’s mayor once specially told the seven class trainers that if they meet a very gifted player then they can let him enter the Hall of Heroic Souls… If the person can obtain the strength inheritance of the Hall of Heroic Souls then directly bring the person over to see him. Even though the power ranking of players is very low, but due to their massive numbers and the gift to not truly die they are undoubtedly an extremely massive force, Forgotten Continent naturally will not look down on them. Towards the super geniuses among them, they will also use all kinds of methods to pull them in. When necessary they could play a great role.</p>
<p>“Please wait for a moment, the mayor will arrive right away.” The city guard brought him to a quite lavishly decorated reception hall, politely saying. He then retreated a few steps, leaving after saluting him.</p>
<p>The reception room is spacious and grand, in the steadiness there is a bit of a modern era atmosphere. Out of courtesy Ling Chen did not sit down. Walking to the middle and standing there he silently waited for the arrival of the Azure Dragon mayor. Being able to see Azure Dragon City’s highest ranking NPC after just arriving at Azure Dragon City could also be considered a relative honour.</p>
<p>“Brother, can you hear?”</p>
<p>A sweet soft voice rose up from the communication device. Ling Chen immediately lifted his left arm, looking towards the name shown on the communication device…</p>
<p>Ruo Ruo Loves Chen.</p>
<p>Ling Chen smiled, smiling exceptionally gently. He put his lips close to the communication device, softly saying: “Ruo Ruo, are you at the novice village already?”</p>
<p>“Ya! And it’s novice village number 49554, the same novice village as brother!” Ling Shui Ruo’s voice had a deep happiness in it. She was just this easily satisfy, being able to be so happy just by being placed in the same novice village as him.</p>
<p>“Haha, because the hearts and fates of me and Ruo Ruo are always closely connected, being placed in the same novice village is not strange at all.” Ling Chen said with a smile. For the first time he was upset about why he left the novice village so early, or else he could bring around Ruo Ruo and do quests together, farm and level up together, and then leave the novice village together, change classes together… How beautiful of a thing would that be. Right now it’s only her in the novice village. Since after him and Ling Shui Ruo met, virtually at all times she had him at her side. Now having her by herself and also being an exceedingly beautiful beauty, it honestly made him unable to relax.</p>
<p>“Hee… Brother, there’s so many people here, and a lot of people are staring at me. I’m a little scared, what should I do?”</p>
<p>With Ling Shui Ruo’s beauty and charisma, no matter where she goes she will always be the focus of all eyes. Ling Chen’s expression became a bit cold, his voice still gentle: “Go to the second little house in the novice village first, that is the novice village’s item shop. Then look for the item shop’s Shopkeeper Wang and ask for a mask. After you get the mask wear it, this way people won’t be able to recognize you, lest some one sets their eyes on my Ruo Ruo. And then go find the village chief, he will tell you some basic knowledge of the game world. Remember to finish listening to everything he says, if there’s something you don’t understand you also have to carefully ask him, he will be very happy to tell you. After he finishes saying everything there will also be an additional reward, and then after that…”</p>
<p>Ling Chen told Ling Shui Ruo in great detail about some processes that she needs to go through at the novice stage, he then talked about some things that she needs to pay attention to… Like absolutely not going near that room in the innermost of the novice village and stuff like that. After talking for quite some time their call finally ended. Ling Shui Ruo carried a heart full of curiosity and jogged towards the item store under the stunned gazes of countless male and female players who were like they’d seen an angel. As for on Ling Chen’s side, the mayor still hadn’t come over.</p>
<p>Walking to a corner of the reception hall, Ling Chen picked up the communication device putting it at his lips, using an extremely low voice saying: “Ghost Fang, is it convenient for you to speak?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“At novice village number 49554, how many people are there?”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Let all the people there secretly protect a girl called ‘Ruo Ruo Loves Chen’, you know who she is. Note, it’s secretly protect, you cannot be discovered by her and especially cannot disturb her. But when necessary, like when she encounters danger then you can act as a passerby to give her help. Also, whoever wants to violate her, no matter who they are, directly kill them, no need to say anything. If someone makes her frightened or even a tiny bit hurt, find their real life identity… Cut them to pieces and feed the dogs!” (TL: This is not a joke…. Although it doesn’t happen.)</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>The communication device hanging up, Ling Chen also retracted his ice cold gaze. He lifted up his arms, silently staring at them.</p>
<p>It’s already been many years… Since after meeting Ruo Ruo I have never killed a person again, the people that I’ve wanted to kill have all been through the hands of others.</p>
<p>Because, these hands of mine that have hugged Ruo Ruo and touched Ruo Ruo’s body, how can they be stained with blood again. And how can I allow hands stained with blood, to go hug and touch my Ruo Ruo who is more kind and pure than even an angel.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Man, I swear to god, half of Ling Chen’s dialogue is “…”, I don’t know why but it’s really pissing me off. Also, as translation time has decreased drastically for me, I think it’s best for me to focus on one project instead for the mean time. That project will be History’s Number 1 Founder. I am not dropping Shura’s Wrath, I’m just giving priority to HN1F, maybe at some point I’ll switch it around and give priority to Shura’s Wrath. For now I’ll mainly be translating History’s Number 1 Founder. This decision is not up for discussion.</p>
<p>After Ling Chen waited for almost 10 minutes the sound of slightly hurried footsteps finally came from outside of the hall. Ling Chen turned around taking off the mask on his face. Facing Azure Dragon’s mayor he obviously can’t continue to wear a mask.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon’s mayor looks around 40 years old. He is a handsome man with a gentle expression, but in the gentleness it is mixed with a deep sense of tiredness. His eyes are sharp but his gaze is slightly dim, clearly caused by overworking. Originally Ling Chen who waited here for 10 minutes had a whole stomach full of resentment and was not going to give this mayor a good attitude, but seeing his worn out look… He clearly isn’t purposely putting on airs but is indeed overly busy, his resentment also directly went away. He went up and greeted him: “Hello mayor, my name is Ling Tian.”</p>
<p>Azure Dragon’s mayor sized him up, saying with a light smile: “Truly the person to stand out from millions of other world humans and arrive here first, you do indeed have an extraordinary aura. Just from your appearance one can tell that you are definitely not an ordinary human. Sigh, just now there was an important matter so I was unable to arrive right away, I am truly sorry for making you wait so long. Come, sit first.”</p>
<p>Coming in this mayor first complimented him and then apologised without any airs, moreover he didn’t have any sort of false or pretentious demeanor. Ling Chen immediately had a more favourable impression towards him, sitting in the chair in the very middle face to face with him. The Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian said that the mayor might hand over a very difficult matter for him to complete, what could it be? Azure Dragon City’s highest ranked NPC — A quest given by the Azure Dragon’s mayor, without needing to think one already knows that it is definitely not normal.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon’s mayor’s gaze fell on the “Proof of Courage” insignia worn at Ling Chen’s chest, his eyes instantly lighting up. “What you’re wearing in front of your chest should be the Proof of Courage insignia. Only the most outstanding heros have the right to wear this insignia, this cannot be faked. Oh right, just now I heard the report say that you obtained the strength inheritance of the Hall of Heroic Souls?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ling Chen replied simply.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon’s mayor let out a wow: “Only in an average of once every hundred years will a person who has the qualifications to obtain the Hall of Heroic Souls’ strength inheritance appear on Forgotten Continent! Having this kind of talent I believe that even though you are a player you will still have extraordinary accomplishments in the future on Forgotten Continent. Oh right, whose power did you inherit.”</p>
<p>“War God’s power.” Ling Chen directly responded saying.</p>
<p>“…” Hearing Ling Chen response Azure Dragon’s mayor clearly blanked for a moment. He lightly shook his exhausted, slightly dizzy head, asking uncertainly: “Say it again, I think I didn’t hear clearly…”</p>
<p>“War God’s power.” Ling Chen once again responded. He knows why Azure Dragon’s mayor would ask again. It’s not that he didn’t hear clearly but instead that he instinctively assumed that the answer he heard was wrong. Because in the perception of these people War God’s trial is simply impossible to pass, which means that there simply isn’t anyone that can pass War God’s trial. After Ling Chen responded again he stood up, in a fleeting grey light he called out War God’s Sword, displaying it before Azure Dragon’s mayor.</p>
<p>The instant War God’s Sword entered his eyes, Azure Dragon’s mayor’s eyes violently contracted. After an instance of silence he abruptly stood up, his shaking eyes tightly stared at War God’s Sword, his voice slightly trembling in shock: “War… War God’s Sword!! You…”</p>
<p>This person… Could it be that he actually passed War God’s trial?</p>
<p>How can that be? The trial that even so many of Forgotten Continent’s prodigies couldn’t pass, how could an otherworld player whose power level is extremely low pass it!</p>
<p>But, War God’s Sword will only be given to the person that passes War God’s Trial!!</p>
<p>“You passed War God’s trial?” Azure Dragon’s mayor shouted in shock. He only knew just now that what he heard before was not an auditory illusion due to exhaustion. As the lord of a city he has seen countless things in his life, he basically won’t have such violent changes in mood. But, the matter of passing War God’s trial is honestly too shocking… Because this is something that no one has been able to do in even 1000 years on Forgotten continent.</p>
<p>“This is the note the Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian let me hand over to you.” Ling Chen didn’t directly respond, turning over to Azure Dragon’s mayor the note that the Hall of Heroic Souls’ guardian gave to him.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon’s mayor took it over, this note is indeed written by the guardian of the Hall of Heroic Souls, there’s no mistake. He quickly opened it looking at the words on top… In a short period of time his expression was covered by layer after layer of shock. When he next lifted his head, the expression of his eyes staring at Ling Chen was like looking at a monster that came from space.</p>
<p>Simultaneously gaining the approval of all of the powers in the Hall of Heroic Souls… Even fighting wanting to voluntarily attach to him.</p>
<p>The pillar in the middle bearing War God’s power disappeared, this person… He truly passed War God’s trial!</p>
<p>The shocked expression remained on the face of Azure Dragon’s mayor for a long time before slowly being suppressed by him. He rapidly adjusted his expression, sizing up Ling Chen again for a long time before saying in amazement: “You actually passed War God’s trial and obtained War God’s strength inheritance. Without any exaggeration you are the most amazing person that I have seen… In my entire life.”</p>
<p>“You are too kind.” Ling Chen shook his head saying, this evaluation was a bit outrageously high.</p>
<p>“No, it is indeed so. The Hall of Heroic Souls has been established for 1000 years, there has never been a person that could pass the trial War God left behind, a whole 1000 years. And you, you have already done it after arriving in the world for just a few short days of time. The height of your talent and skill is virtually unbelievable. If the matter of War God’s strength being inherited travels out you will become known by all within a short period of time. You’ve just arrive at Forgotten Continent, you definitely don’t know how impressive of a matter passing War God’s trial is in our eyes. That was originally a universally recognized trial that could not be passed.”</p>
<p>“Let’s just forget about that, I don’t want too many people to know.” Ling Chen said.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon’s mayor nodded his head and started smiling: “Strong but not cocky, very good. If that’s the case then I won’t have people publicize this. Although I think I need to tell Forgotten City’s emperor about this matter, he will definitely be very interested. Although you can relax, since you are unwilling he naturally will not announce this matter either. Letting him know your name earlier will have a great benefit towards you gaining a foothold in Forgotten City.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded his head and did not oppose, instead directly asking: “Mr. Mayor, I heard that recently you’ve had some troublesome problems? I wonder if there’s anything I can help with?”</p>
<p>Azure Dragon’s mayor was dazed for a moment and then Ling Chen saw that a fleeting light seemed to flash across his eyes for an instant. Azure Dragon’s mayor slowly nodded his head: “There is indeed, moreover this matter has made me sleepless for this period of time. Are you willing to listen to me explain this matter and then help me?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded his head… No shit, the reason he came here was to accept this quest of the mayor’s, how could he refuse.</p>
<p>“In truth I originally wouldn’t hand this matter over to you players because with the strength of you players it is simply impossible to complete. But… “ Azure Dragon’s mayor stared straight at Ling Chen, his gaze filled with hot steamy passion: “You are the person that passed War God’s trial, you are a peerless prodigy that Forgotten Continent has yet to see in 1000 years! Being able to create the miracle of passing War God’s trial, maybe… You really can help me. In addition, what makes me most at ease is that even if you players die you can also revive right away and your level just drops by 1. So I don’t even really need to worry about your safety.”</p>
<p>The corner of Ling Chen’s lips twitched… He has the “protection” of Lunar Scourge, after he dies his level doesn’t just drop by one level, dying once his level will directly return to zero! All of his hard work will go down the drain. For players there is simply no punishment more cruel than this. Although he didn’t interrupt, continuing to listen to Azure Dragon’s mayor talk.</p>
<p>“Sigh,” Azure Dragon’s mayor let out a long sigh and then started to explain: “Speaking of it this matter is very easy, it’s just finding an item, but it is also incredibly difficult. Just one month ago when my youngest son was in the Black Forest training, he encountered the attack of a powerful Lord monster the Green-Eyed Mosaic Snake. Even though he escaped with his life he was bitten by the Green-Eye Mosaic Snake. There are extremely few Green-Eyed Mosaic Snakes, reportedly the number of Green-Eyed Mosaic Snakes on Forgotten Continent will not surpass 10. It is a type of extremely scary venomous snake, if you are bitten by it once you will definitely die if the venom is not cured on time. And there is only one thing that can cure the Green-Eyed Mosaic Snake’s venom, it’s name is called Black Flame Grass.”</p>
<p>Black Flame Grass… Ling Chen remembered this name.</p>
<p>“Black Flame Grass is a type of very special and also very recognizable herb. It is only a dozen centimeters tall, its entire body is pitch black and it’s shape is like burning fire. Its numbers are very few, only existing in places that are dark all year round. And currently there is only one place in the entirety of Forgotten Continent that is known to have Black Flame Grass… That is place located at the most eastern part of Forgotten Continent called ‘Silent Soul Ridge’. Silent Soul Ridge is located about 200 miles east of Azure Dragon City, and that is one of the forbidden areas for humans on Forgotten Continent. Silent Soul Ridge’s sky is dark all year round, this is something that everyone on Forgotten Continent knows, but nobody knows why. Some say that countless bones are buried there thus creating numerous undead, driving away the light there. There are also some that say there is a powerful demonic beast of darkness hiding there. Its darkness aura covered the sky, but they are all guesses, nobody dares to approach the place to find the real answer… Because of the people that have entered Silent Soul Ridge there has never been a person that could come out alive. Never!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“Silent Soul Ridge also gained its name from this. Once you get close you will turn into an undead as one of the wisps of silence there. These few days to find Black Flame Grass for my son I have sent a total of three waves of fearless expert bodyguards over… On the way we’ve always been maintaining communication, but once they reach Silent Soul Ridge communication will be entirely cut off and then there will be no word of them. They… clearly all died there. After three waves I didn’t dare to send people again to go die there, but Black Flame Grass and my youngest son’s venom, sigh…”</p>
<p>“You want me to take a trip to Silent Soul Ridge and then bring back Black Flame Grass?” Ling Chen understood what the quest is that Azure Dragon’s mayor is about to give to him.</p>
<p>“Yes! I bid you, you have to help me. Right now it is also only you this kind of person that has enough strength and does not need to worry too much about death that can help me. My youngest son’s venom has been controlled at the moment, but if one month passes and we still don’t have the Black Flame Grass then his venom will completely act up, at that time he will die for sure. So please, you have to help me go to Silent Soul Ridge and get the Black Flame Grass before one month. If you succeed I will definitely greatly repay you!!” Azure Dragon’s mayor said seriously and emotionally.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have triggered the quest ‘Looking for Black flame Grass’, Quest Description: Go to Silent Soul Ridge, obtain Black Flame Grass and give it to Azure Dragon’s mayor. Quest Type: Unique Hidden, Quest Time Limit: 1 month, Quest Reward: Unknown. Quest Penalty: Fame drops to 0, Azure Dragon’s mayor’s favorability towards you will greatly decrease, from then on you cannot accept any quests in Azure Dragon City, do you accept?”</p>
<p>“Ding… Warning. This quest’s difficulty is extremely high, with your current strength it is Entirely Impossible’, if you accept there is an extremely high probability of facing the cruel failure penalty, please consider carefully.”</p>
<p>Facing Azure Dragon’s mayor’s eager gaze and the notification sound by his ears Ling Chen fell silent.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Man, this chapter makes no sense to me. What has to be going through your head to decide to go solo a LV80-100 or above super nightmare impossible difficulty level dungeon at LV11 where dying or failure to complete the quest completely screws you over.</p>
<p>Should I accept this quest?</p>
<p>Ling Chen was not surprised at all about Azure Dragon’s mayor giving him a relatively difficult quest. Because any quest with either of the attributes “Hidden” or “Unique” are all exceptionally hard, and quests with the “Hidden Unique” attribute are even more difficult. But what Ling Chen didn’t expect is the penalty suffered if this quest fails… Fame directly dropping to 0, mayor’s favourabilty greatly decreases, unable to receive any quests in Azure Dragon City…</p>
<p>The fuck, is there a quest penalty more brutal than this!! This is practically even scarier than level dropping by 3! If he really fails this quest, this failure penalty will cause him to struggle greatly in Azure Dragon City. This quest penalty also seems to have just a bit of a soul… If he doesn’t accept the quest then that’s that, nothing will happen. But once he accepts it Azure Dragon’s mayor will attach the hope of saving his son to him. If he succeeds he will naturally be thanked profusely, but if he fails… and then the mayor’s son dies, then all of his resentment will be directly focused on Ling Chen. Who cares whether or not he’s War God’s successor, his favorability will directly drop to the level of disgust. Once news of this spreads there won’t be an NPC in Azure Dragon City willing give him a quest…</p>
<p>Moreover, this quest’s difficulty has been directly determined by the system as “Impossible to complete”, and it is accompanied by such a terrifying failure penalty. Do I really accept it? Hidden unique quests are indeed accompanied by generous rewards, but the difficulty is also extremely high, at the same time there will also be the brutal death penalty. The levels of Azure Dragon City’s city guard’s at the very least have to be LV80 and above, even people of this level of strength directly vanished after going to Silent Soul Ridge, he’s just a player that just reached LV11… Anybody would think that this is simply suicide, and suicide isn’t the end, a big pile of scary penalties will be smashed downwards closely afterwards.</p>
<p>But…on the flip side, doesn’t the scarier the difficulty and penalty of a quest mean that after completion, one will be able to obtain increasingly greater rewards?</p>
<p>“Okay, I accept! Within one month I will bring back Black Flame Grass.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen lifted his head, focusing his eyes and giving Azure Dragon’s mayor his response. After responding the worry and hesitation in his heart instantly vanished without trace. The reason that an extremely little number of people can be different from the vast majority of people is because they dare to do things that most people don’t have the courage and resolution to do. In this world there has never been anything that is “absolutely impossible”, just like War God’s trial that he passed before, isn’t that also an impossible to pass trial in their mouths? But the result is that he chose it and passed.</p>
<p>“Good!” Azure Dragon’s mayor joyfully nodded his head: “Truly the person that can pass War God’s trial, just this resolution of not being afraid of hardships and death is enough to impress people. Even though your strength right now is very low, I can feel an inexplicable sense of trust from you. The journey towards Silent Soul Ridge is long, going towards there it’s best if you go to the mount shop and pick a mount, oh right…” Azure Dragon’s mayor took out magic pen and paper and rapidly wrote down a few lines of words. He then sealed it in an envelope: “Take this and then hand it to the mount shop’s store owner. He will gift you the mount shop’s best mount for free.”</p>
<p>“Even though I am anxious and uneasy in my heart, I still suggest that you first increase your strength before going to Silent Soul Ridge. You have inherited War God’s strength so your levelling speed should be very fast. The higher your strength the better your chances. When you’re prepared to go towards Silent Soul Ridge, leave from the east and continue heading east, when you can’t find the path you can ask the citizens along the way. Any random person will know where the path is towards Silent Soul Ridge. After all that is a forbidden area that everybody knows. Young man, I can no longer bear to let countless city guards go die, all of my hope is placed on you, I await your triumphant return…”</p>
<p>I am a dividing line…</p>
<p>“I’ve accepted a really troublesome quest.” Holding onto [Azure Dragon’s mayor’s Letter of Introduction] and walking out of the mayor’s residence, Ling Chen said so in a low voice. This is undoubtedly the hardest quest he has ever seen along with the most brutal quest penalty. Forgotten Continent’s countless masters don’t even dare to set foot there, a forbidden area where whoever goes there dies. I’m just a tiny player, can I really complete this quest? He was worried… But in reality, the depths of his heart was jumping with excitement. He was born as the kind of person where the harder something is, the more he wants to challenge it.</p>
<p>“Since I’ve accepted it then I will prepare properly.”</p>
<p>Heading towards the item he used the big pile of gold coins dropped by the Zephyr Bird to max out his yellow potions and dark blue potions. After thinking for a moment he then bought some luxury items… The green potion that can instantly recover 800 HP, lastly he got a copy of Azure Dragon City’s map and then walked out of the item shop.</p>
<p>On the Azure Dragon City map he locked onto the location of the mount shop and then headed straight there.</p>
<p>The mount shop is not big, there is only a shriveled, old little man watching the shop. Maybe due to there being no business the little old man is sitting there listless, hearing someone come in he also only moved his eyelids, too lazy to even open his eyes.</p>
<p>Ling Chen swept the surroundings with his eyes and did not see any mounts or anything related, but on the wall behind the little old man there hangs the codes and prices of all kinds of mounts.</p>
<p>[Bay Horse]: Grade 1 mount, after mounting movement speed+20, no extra abilities, cannot be upgraded. Price: 200 gold.</p>
<p>[Big Horse]: Grade 1 mount, after mounting movement speed+30, no extra abilities, cannot be upgraded. Price: 500 gold.</p>
<p>[Thousand Mile Horse]: Grade 1 mount, after mounting movement speed+40, no extra abilities, cannot be upgraded. Price: 2000 gold.</p>
<p>[Akhal-Teke Horse]: Grade 1 mount, after mounting movement speed+50, no extra abilities, cannot be upgraded. Price: 5000 gold.</p>
<p>[Cloud Trotting Horse]: Grade 1 mount, after mounting movement speed+60, no extra abilities, cannot be upgraded. Price: 20000 gold.</p>
<p>The mount shop only sells a total of 5 kinds of horses. Following the increase of the added movement speed the prices also rise at a staggering pace. That last mount the Cloud Trotting Horse that adds 60 movement speed is actually sold at 20000 gold! At the current moment where currency exchange has yet to open, this is an astronomical price that nobody can pay. Although these prices also visually display the importance of movement speed in the game world. Regardless of which profession, movement speed is always an extremely important attribute, nobody has ever doubted this. Due to this, no matter what equipment it is as long as it adds movement speed then it is the best of the best.</p>
<p>“Boss, get a horse.” Ling Chen took a few steps forward, taking out Azure Dragon’s mayor’s letter of introduction.</p>
<p>Hearing Ling Chen’s voice the little old man selling horses finally opened his eyes by a slit. Seeing the letter in Ling Chen’s hands his eyes finally opened fully. He took an extra glance at Ling Chen and then carefully took over the letter. After opening it he quickly looked through it twice and then sat up straight, saying seriously: “Since it’s Mr. Mayor’s will, then, I’ll temporarily lend you a horse.” Finishing speaking he waved his hand, a beam of white light landed on Ling Chen’s body.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have obtained mount ‘Cloud Trotting Horse’, now exists in your mount space.”</p>
<p>Holy shit! Cloud Trotting Horse! The Cloud Trotting Horse that is a whole 20000 gold coins!!</p>
<p>Faced with such an expensive gift Ling Chen also couldn’t help but be excited for a moment. But his excitement only lasted for two seconds and was then immediately dowse by a notification sound,</p>
<p>“Ding… The Cloud Trotting Horse that you have obtained is temporarily lent to you by the mount shop. If you complete the ‘Looking for Black Flame Grass’ quest then you will not need to return it. If you do not complete the ‘Looking for Black Flame Grass’ quest then you must return the Cloud Trotting Horse after one month. If the Cloud Trotting Horse cannot be returned due to death or other such reasons then the money you possess will be gradually deducted until 20 thousand gold has been deducted.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “God freaking! @#￥%…”</p>
<p>It’s actually just borrowed!!</p>
<p>Can you not be so cheap!</p>
<p>Ling Chen grinned and did not say anything more, directly leaving the mount shop. Looking at the time he held up the communication device and connected to Ling Shui Ruo who was far away at novice village number 49554.</p>
<p>“Ruo Ruo, where are you right now?”</p>
<p>“Beating up little monsters and doing quests. Oh right brother, two high level big sisters said they want to help me level up. These two big sisters both look very gentle and even helped me chase away a number of guys that wanted to approach me. Should I agree?”</p>
<p>If a man wanted to get close to Ling Shui Ruo Ling Chen would definitely not agree. Ling Shui Ruo herself would also oppose because she knows her own charms, but females… Two high level females, why would they voluntarily get close to a young girl that has just entered the game? Could it be…</p>
<p>“What are their names?” Ling Chen asked.</p>
<p>“Names, um… One is called Yao Yin, one is called Qian Mo.”</p>
<p>Yao Yin and Qian Mo… So that’s how it is. Ling Chen’s expression eased up. He said with a light smile: “They definitely think that you’re very cute which is why they want to voluntarily bring you along. Then just agree to them. With them carrying you levelling up will definitely be a lot quicker.”</p>
<p>“Ok! Then I’ll agree now.”</p>
<p>With those two people around the worry that Ling Chen has for Shui Ruo eased up a lot. After ending the call Ling Chen summoned the Cloud Trotting Horse. Getting on the horse with a jump his movement speed instantly increased greatly, he headed straight towards the eastern gate of Azure Dragon City. One month can be a long or short period of time. As Azure Dragon’s mayor said, before going to Silent Soul Ridge the most important thing is increasing his level. At the very least he has to level up to the point where he can equip the Zephyr Blade. After equipping the Zephyr Blade his strength will greatly rise up again.</p>
<p>Current SP: 2180.</p>
<p>Killing the three Lord bosses and a Zephyr Bird in War God’s Trial Ground Ling Chen obtained a huge amount of SP. This SP is enough for him to upgrade the battle soul profession’s basic skills by a good number of levels. He opened his skill page and after pondering for a decent amount of time he chose to place 1600 of the SP into [Item Manipulation Technique].</p>
<p>“Ding… Your skill Item Manipulation Technique has successfully upgraded to LV3.”</p>
<p>[Item Manipulation Technique]: Current Level: LV3, Highest Level: LV10. Sp to Upgrade to LV4: 2400. Ancient battle technique, after practice equipment that surpasses your current level can be equipped. Effect: Ignores any piece of equipment’s level requirement by 3 levels.</p>
<p>Item Manipulation Technique upgraded to LV3, like this he only has to wait for his level to increase one more time and he will be able to equip LV15 equipment — Including the Zephyr Sword.</p>
<p>Ling Chen put the remaining 580 SP into Four Corners Star Formation. A beam of light flashed by and Four Corners Star Formation Upgraded to LV3.</p>
<p>[Four Corners Star Formation]: Current Level: LV3, Highest Level: LV10, SP required to upgrade to LV4: 800. Using the power of the battle soul to sweep the surroundings, instantly forming a formation of destruction in a 10 meter radius around yourself. The raging battle soul power will deal devastating damage towards all targets within the formation. Damage is equal to 400% of regular damage, Critical Hit Rate+10%, 100% chance to trigger knock back, MP Consumption: 100, Cooldown Time: 60 secs.</p>
<p>The power and critical hit ability of the upgraded Four Corners Star Formation once again increased, and his SP also only remained the last 80 points. Finishing allocating his SP Ling Chen increased his speed, heading straight towards the east gate.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I read a theory for Harry Potter saying that Dumbledore was behind all of the events in Harry Potter. Not that he’s the mastermind behind them, but he knew and allowed them all to happen and secretly guided Harry. In all the events before his death, Dumbledore was actually secretly following and protecting Harry so he was never actually ever in any true mortal danger. All of this to establish Harry as the hero and to train him. Seems quite plausible to me. </p>
<p>Every player has their own personal mount space that can harbour 10 mounts, but one can only summon one mount to ride. Mounts are the means of transportation for players, in the process of riding one will not receive damage. At the same time at the early stages of the game the only professions that can engage in combat while mounted are warriors and shield-guards. Archers, assassins, mages, priests and summoners all cannot engage in combat while mounted. They can only have the ability to fight while mounted after their level surpasses LV30 and they learn the respective skills, like “Mounted Archery” of the bow classes.</p>
<p>Riding a mount greatly increases movement speed. In a virtual game world movement speed is undoubtedly an important attribute, its importance is not only displayed in the time of travelling but also that it greatly affects the execution of combat tactics and the results of battles. Especially when facing opponents with powerful strength, strong movement speed can not only greatly increase one’s kiting ability, but when facing opponents so powerful that they are hard to contend with one can also safely escape. In all professions assassins have the strongest movement speed, their powerful mobility perfectly makes up for their low defense and health flaw. Ambushing, kiting, pinning and escaping are all benefited in every way. Although riding a mount is also not with disadvantages and that is that it will greatly lower one’s own bodily freedom. After all, there is more freedom when controlling one’s own body compared to controlling a mount. So if you had Ling Chen choose he would discard the mount when fighting monsters.</p>
<p>The mounts themselves usually will not have any attack ability, at least all of the ones in Azure Dragon City’s store don’t. Mount’s are also split into different grades, from weakest to strongest they are split as grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, grade 4, grade 5, Celestial grade, Heaven End grade, Mysterious God grad and Saint Destroyer grade. The mounts the mount shop sell are mounts from grade 1 to grade 3 and are the ones where it is relatively easy for players to obtain. And starting from grade 5 mounts start to possess other support effects, even possessing a certain degree of attack ability being able to support the owner in battle. But it is very hard to obtain grade 5 and upwards mounts, it is simply not something that regular players can dream of.</p>
<p>The grade 3 Cloud Stepping Mare already requires 20 thousand gold, how valuable grade 4 mounts are can be imagined. The ones above grade 4… regular players probably can’t hope for one in their entire lives, and they are also simply things that you can’t even buy with money.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon City is a bit exaggeratingly big, Ling Chen finally saw Azure Dragon Ctiy’s east gate after riding the Cloud Stepping Mare for a long time and almost falling asleep on it.</p>
<p>The eastern outskirt near Azure Dragon City is a leisure area scattered with emerald green grass and gurgling streams. The animals that occasionally appear are also all animals without any attack ability like rabbits and kittens. Further east is the area of a plain and a forest.</p>
<p>“Ding… You have entered the map ‘The Plains’.”</p>
<p>Due to being close to Azure Dragon City, the creatures wandering on The Plains are all a couple of low-level monsters. At the border is the LV10 monster the [Restless Antelope], right now what Ling Chen needs to do the most is level up, naturally he won’t waste any time on these low-level creatures. He continued heading forward, rushing straight towards the deeper parts of The Plains.</p>
<p>The center of The Plains is the territory of the LV15 Red-Eyed Lizards.</p>
<p>[Red-Eyed Lizard]: Type: Beast, Level: LV15, HP: 650. Strangely shaped lizard that possesses red pupils, its body will occasionally shoot out sparks, due to this it commonly creates small scale fire disasters on The Plains.</p>
<p>The Red-Eyed Lizard is very big, each one is around 2 meters long, gathered together they have quite the terrifying overtone. Ling Chen stopped and jumped off from the Cloud-Stepping Mare, landing in the territorial area of the Red-Eyed Lizards. Because the Red-Eyed Lizards here are honestly a bit too concentrated, this place is a perfect place for farming.</p>
<p>With a flash of light two weapons were simultaneously summoned into his hands. He opened his stat page looking at his current stats:</p>

<p>Unmatchable stats, unmatchable skills and equipment, if Ling Chen’s current status was publicized who knows how great of an uproar he would induce and how many shocked eyeballs he would obliterate. And right now, at a level of LV12, while the other players are all still fighting hard in the novice village, he has come alone to a farming ground packed to the brim with LV15 creatures.</p>
<p>“Brother, I levelled up!!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was just about to start abusing this group of Red-Eyed Lizards when Ling Shui Ruo’s cry of happiness suddenly came from the communication device. The corners of Ling Chen’s lips slightly curved… But levelling up only one level after a small part of the morning, this speed was honestly a bit…</p>
<p>After chatting with Ling Shui Ruo for a while Ling Chen raised his weapons, charging towards the Red-Eyed Lizards.</p>
<p>After players experience their first job-change and possess an official class their skills become more versatile and mature, their corresponding stats increase and their strength also increases greatly. And the increase of the strength of players will naturally spur the increase of the strength of monsters. The overall strength of this group of Red-Eyed Lizards is leagues ahead of the creatures in the novice village, their levels are also 4 levels higher than Ling Chen’s current level, but in front of Ling Chen’s powerful stats…</p>
<p>“Ling Tian Slash!”</p>
<p>Raising up Soaring Cloud high over his head and fiercely slashing down, when Ling Tian Slash was activated it brought up a powerful blast of air, hitting straight on the Red-Eyed Lizard closest to Ling Tian.</p>
<p>-1207!</p>
<p>A 4-digit damage value floated up from the Red-Eyed Lizards head, directly emptying its HP, its massive body was even smashed backwards a distance of nearly three body positions. With this attack it was immediately like Ling Chen had poked the hornet’s nest, the surrounding Red-Eyed Lizards that originally had nothing to do immediately all surrounded him accompanied by the crackling sound of flying sparks. The lizards here are spawned particularly concentratedly, in the blink of an eye a dozen lizards had already surrounded him, raising their tails and heavily whipping towards his body.</p>
<p>The speed of the Red-Eyed Lizards also exceeded Ling Chen’s expectations, being suddenly surrounded by a dozen monsters in an instant. If it was another player they would be directly dumbfounded and then choose to flee in panic. Against the surrounding attacks Ling Chen did not even bother looking, his two arms simultaneously using “Ling Tian Burst”. Right away, two energy waves stacked over each other fiercely rushed forward.</p>
<p>-632, -627, -1248, -631, -661…</p>
<p>A large group of densely packed damage values floated up chaotically in front of Ling Chen, that is a whole 14 damage values. When a Red-Eyed Lizard is hit by Ling Tian Burst once, if a critical or pierce occurs it will be directly insta-killed, even if a critical or pierce doesn’t occur it will still be put in a critical state. And being hit twice by Ling Tian Burst it is a guaranteed death for the Red-Eyed Lizards. Under the two stacked Ling Tian Bursts seven Red-Eyed Lizards in front of him instantly died. Ling Chn did not pause at all, swiftly turning his body and another two Ling Tian Bursts slashing backwards. In a series of concentrated colliding and cutting sounds the five Red-Eyed Lizards behind him also all died.</p>
<p>“Tut tut, this efficiency.” Looking at the group of Red-Eyed Lizards in front and behind that had fallen down to the ground in the blink of an eye, even Ling Chen couldn’t help but praise himself. Under normal circumstances if a LV11 player encounters a LV15 monster they will all choose to pick up their legs and run, and yet with a casual wave of his arms it was like destroying a group of LV1 little monsters. Even though there is the influence of Heaven’s Jealousy and his levelling difficulty is double of other people, but with this efficiency he believes that even if he is only online everyday for a max of 10 hours… he still won’t be slower compared to other people and will even be faster that the majority of players.</p>
<p>“Come, Xiao Hui, come out and devour them!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen summoned Xiao Hui. Seeing a pile of monster corpses Xiao Hui’s two eyes emitted a light of excitement. It rapidly ran over to the corpse of a Red-Eyed Lizard, opening its mouth and spitting out a grey light. In the blink of an eye is swallowed the Red-Eyed Lizard’s corpse into his mouth. Ling Chen had already discovered that the speed of Xiao Hui’s Soul Devour is not dependant on the size of the target’s body but instead the strength of the energy. The stronger the creature the longer it takes to devour.</p>
<p>In a bit Xiao Hui who had finished devouring one Red-Eyed Lizard stretched his neck, spitting out a red crystalline item. This item looked very familiar to Ling Chen. He walked over and picked it up, surprisingly discovering that his is actually an beginner strength crystal!</p>
<p>Killing a Red-Eyed Lizard can approximately give you about 7 or 8 copper coins, and one beginner strength crystal is sold for 20 gold at the store! Selling back to the pawnshop it can still be sold for a high price of 8 gold (Items sold back are at 40%).</p>
<p>If just one Red-Eyed Lizards corpse can refine out a beginner strength crystal, then he can have a profit of 8 gold coins after killing a Red-Eyed Lizard… Ling Chen scanned Red-Eyed Lizards covering the land, this is not only piles of experience but also pile of shining gold coins!</p>
<p>Xiao Hui that finished devouring one Red-Eyed Lizard scampered over towards the other Red-Eyed Lizards, opening its mouth and spitting out a massive grey light. Under Ling Chen’s surprised gaze Xiao Hui enveloped a whole five Red-Eyed Lizard corpses at once and then the 5 corpses all turned into grey light being swallowed by Xiao Hui. The time it took was no different for devouring one.</p>
<p>And the different result is… Simultaneously refining 5 Red-Eyed Lizards Xiao Hui spit out an even bigger red crystal. Ling Chen rapidly walked forward picking it up.</p>
<p>Elementary strength crystal!</p>
<p>Ling Chen lifted up his head… Each of those rapidly crawling Red-Eyed Lizards had already turned into piles of moving gold coins in his eyes.</p>
<p>Elementary strength crystals, that’s a price of 200 golds coins in the shop!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The difference between elementary strength crystals and advanced strength crystals is significant; elementary strength crystals are used in novice villages but after leaving the novice village, naturally the elementary strength [TLN: That’s what it says in the Raws] crystals become popular amongst the players, after all the elementary strength crystals could be sold at the store, but the price is 10 times higher than the beginner crystals. But it was generally accepted that the crystals had a very low drop rate. If one day, a large batch of elementary strength crystals could be sold, and sold at a lower price than the shops…… e.g. 150 gold coins, then the players will go insane! Because strength crystals have the highest requirements out of all the energy crystals.</p>
<p>Eating a single red eyed lizard can produce 1 beginner strength crystal, at the same time swallowing 5 can produce an elementary strength crystal. What if it swallowed even more at once? Will it produce an intermediate strength crystal that at this point could not be bought anywhere?</p>
<p>The idea seemed good… but after Ling Chens inspection, swallowing 5 at once was Xiao Hui’s limit. At least for now.</p>
<p>In that case, let’s go!</p>
<p>In the quiet central plains, Ling Chen entered, breaking the silence. It was Red Eyed Lizard territory. Ling Chen rushed out to fight, holding 2 weapons. He chose the places where there were highly populated with Red Eyed Lizards, one look and the group of Red Eyed Lizards in that direction would run away, then two Ling Tian Burst came down at once. His shots were extremely fast and precise, the Red Eyed Lizards couldn’t even get a chance to make an attack before dying. And the poor lizards even after dying did not get peace, as Xiao Hui would rush out to swallow them, engulfing their bodies till there was nothing left. And in accordance to the instructions of Ling Chen, each time it would swallow 5 units at a time. Every time this happened, it would spit out an elementary strength crystal. Ling Chen killed quickly, Xiao Hui also swallowed quickly, they did not slow down, it was only when Ling Chen finished the eradication process, and was finished picking up the spoils, did it finish swallowing.</p>
<p>The wideness of the plain was incomparable, it was capable of accommodating thousands of people training at the same time, but this large place was cleared out by Ling Chen and Xiao Hui to the point where it was deserted. With Ling Chen’s scary clear rate, in a short time, the dense population of Red Eyed Lizards had become sparse. Killing two at once was not satisfying enough, Ling Chen simply had to keep going, so he cleared yet another area of Red Eyed Lizards before returning. Just like that he alternated between two areas, left right, left right… the respawn rate of the Red Eyed Lizards could barely keep up with the rate they were being killed.</p>
<p>After an hour…</p>
<p>“Ding!… your pet [Spirit Beast] Xiao Hui has successfully levelled up to level 9, HP +200, MP +5, Defense +20.”</p>
<p>After swallowing a bunch of red eyed lizard bodies, Xiao Hui successfully levelled up to level 9. Under normal circumstances, a pets levelling rate is the same as the players levelling rate, that is the say the rate of growth of Xiao Hui for swallowing the lizards is the same for Ling Chen when killing the same type of monsters. So, its levelling rate has a “jealous” trait, doubling the rate of Ling Chen, as a result, after not too long, it will catch up to the level of Ling Chen. But, a pets level can never be higher than the master, so, when Ling Chen and Xiao Huis levels are the same, it will be directly gated by Ling Chens level, which is equivalent to suffering from “jealous”.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s own experience had also increased, and in this hour, his bag, had gained an additional 260 elementary strength crystals… of course, the initial primary strength crystal was now negligible.</p>
<p>Crystals do not count as equipment within the bag, like potions, it could only store up to 200 of the same on a storage grid. 260 elementary strength crystals, even they were cashed in directly to the pawnshop in Azure Dragon City, they can be sold for more than 20 thousand gold coins. When Xiao Hui levelled up it also stopped for a moment, so Ling Chen counted the number of crystals in his bag, he could only think of one thing…</p>
<p>I’m rich!</p>
<p>I’m really rich!!</p>
<p>In an hour, he eradicated monsters and levelled, which then resulted in minimum earnings of at least 20 thousand gold coins! 20 thousand gold coins… having 20 thousand gold coins in the early game, it was undoubtedly equivalent to being a billionaire. Also the gold that he obtained only took 1 hour to obtain.</p>
<p>Looking at the wiggling tail that was looking around for new objectives, it was obviously Xiao Hui being unsatisfied. Ling Chen really did not know how to describe its strength.</p>
<p>This is just an initial stage, only level 15 monsters, what if its later in the game, where it would devour higher level monsters, or a high level boss, he had no idea what it would refine and spit out.</p>
<p>At noon, Ling Chen called Ling Shui Ruo to go offline for a break and lunch. Afternoon was spent with Shui Ruo going online together, once again going to the Red Eyed Lizards territory. After enjoying the peace of the late afternoon, the Red Eyed Lizards population had become dense once again, Ling Chen then did a quick sweep, as far as the eye could see, then the bodies of Red Eyed Lizard littered the ground, which was then followed by Xiao Hui, turning them into elementary strength crystals.</p>
<p>For the next two days, Ling Chen planned to stay here.</p>
<p>He had killed a few thousand Red Eyed Lizards, he used up 9 pieces of equipment… 7 white equips, 2 steel equipment and there wasn’t even a hint of bronze gear that could be seen. He also used quite a large amount of restoration potions, in addition to the fact that he originally had full supplies, he was able to stay here and farm for a whole day without needing to return to resupply.</p>
<p>Half the afternoon had past and countless Red Eyed Lizards had become Ling Chens EXP and elementary strength crystals in his bag. As Ling Chen’s EXP slowly grew closer to reaching level 12, Xiao Hui was also close to reaching level 10.</p>
<p>“Older brother, I’m level 2!!”</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo happily cried, then Ling Chen did 2 “Ling Tian Burst” sweeps, killing all the Red Eyed Lizards in front of him, and started laughing. Hearing Shui Ruo’s voice while doing something so boring, the restlessness in his heart suddenly disappeared. He lifted his left hand, and spoke into the intercom: “go Ruo Ruo…oh, I’ll just continue to clear these groups.”</p>
<p>As he said that, less than 10 metres in front of him, a great lizard with a shining body appeared. This lizard was 4 to 5 metres long, its whole body was on fire and was releasing a red light. As it appeared a surge of hot air surged towards him, the red eyed lizards in the area all gathered around it, and panic spread to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Finally an elite monster has appeared… wait, this doesn’t seem like an elite, could it be…</p>
<p>[Flaming Komodo Dragon]: Type: Beast Level: 15 Grade: Lord HP: 15000 Mutation of Red Eyed Lizard [has a huge body and strong defence, high offensive capabilities, aggressive attitude due to the flames, any part of the body can release a jet of flames.]</p>
<p>Ling Chen had been tearing up the Red Eyed Lizard territory all morning and half the afternoon, and not even a small boss had appeared, now that something had appeared… it was a lord!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen turned off the intercom, he started to look a little more serious, and he took the initiative to move as fast as the wind. The size of the Flaming Komodo Dragon was large, but its movements were not slow. As Ling Chen got close, his body suddenly swung around, a huge tail swung around with a whistling sound towards Ling Chen’s body. If this hits, it would knock Ling Chen back at least 10 metres away.</p>
<p>But Ling Chens speed could match it, he put a foot down, and jumped high into the air, easily dodging the sweep from the Flaming Komodo Dragon. As he was falling down he landed right in front of the Flaming Komodo Dragon, using both hands to activate “Ling Tian Slash” as he was falling.</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>
<p>-966, -1245(hit)!</p>
<p>The Flaming Komodo Dragon’s defence was not really covered, and with Ling Chen’s strong base attack providing a large part of the damage, whether ordinary level 15 players could break through the defence is the question.</p>
<p>2 Ling Tian Slashes pushed the Flaming Komodo Dragon’s body back by 2 metres. It was obviously getting angry, the flames on its body grew more chaotic, its body retreated slightly. His mouth suddenly opened… Ling Chen raised his eyebrow, without thinking he quickly rolled out of the way.</p>
<p>Fwwoooooo…</p>
<p>5-6 metre flames came out of the Flaming Komodo Dragon’s mouth causing the air around to heat up. Ling Chen rushed to the side of the Flaming Komodo Dragon to avoid the flame, following up with 2 cuts.</p>
<p>-952，-1910，-961，-959！</p>
<p>The Flaming Komodo Dragon HP bar that was twinkling was cut nearly in half, causing the Komodo Dragon to retract its flames and start to retreat. It tossed its head, letting out a very harsh sounding hiss. The sound had a strong penetrating power, it travelled a long distance, suddenly, in a 10 metre radius around it, all the Red Eyed Lizards all went ballistic, madly rushing to Ling Chen’s location. Ling Chen quickly glanced around counting, there was 50-60! At this scale, plus the one Lord class boss, it would scare a dozen of players away at once.</p>
<p>This was free EXP, Ling Chen grinned, and without looking, he rushed around towards the Red Eyed Lizards, straight towards the Flaming Komodo Dragon, unceremoniously performing 2 more Ling Tian Slash. When the Flaming Komodo Dragon wanted to counterattack, he used the Moon Shadow, leaving the body deadly still. Then 2 rounds of Ling Tian Slash to hack into its body. Causing this strong lord to be left as bloody residue, at this time, Ling Chen stopped the attack, and silently looked around at the Red Eyed Lizard group that was getting more and more dense, he leisurely raised his left hand with the Soaring Cloud.</p>
<p>“Soul sacrifice!!”</p>
<p>“Battle Soul Possession”</p>
<p>Two scary rays of light emitted from Ling Chens body, what was even scarier was a sudden shockwave which had exponential power. The surrounding 50+ Red Eyed Lizards all were gathered into a gruesome circle, nearby, only one step away, it also got rid of the body of the Flaming Komodo Dragon. Ling Chen finally got to see some action, the soaring cloud in the air suddenly fell down, 4 beams condensed from the invisible fighting spirit and fired out in 4 different directions…</p>
<p>Four Corners Star Formation! [四方星阵]</p>
<p>Four fighting spirits fired out, and intertwined, flying into the sky, with Ling Chen’s body in the centre, forming a diagonal square shape, then…</p>
<p>Boom!!!</p>
<p>All the fighting spirit exploded.</p>
<p>-18400，-14365，-36798，-18392，-36690………………</p>
<p>Ling Chen calculated that the Four Corners Star Formation would have enveloped the Flaming Komodo Dragon and all the Red Eyed Lizards that ran towards him, and in the explosive destruction, extreme damage was dealt one after another, eradicating all the lizards. Soul Sacrifice combined with Battle Soul Possession, together with the strongest attack, Four Corners Star Formation, this is the upper limit of Ling Chen’s attacks, one critical strike after another, all in all, dealing over 30k damage!</p>
<p>There is no doubt, whether it is the Flaming Komodo Dragon, or 50+ Red Eyed Lizards, the Four Corners Star Formation would have killed everything, not leaving a single soul!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Ding… you have successfully defeated a level 15 boss ‘Flaming Komodo Dragon’, reputation + 150, skill points +150”</p>
<p>“Ding… congratulations you have leveled up, now level 12, HP +20, MP+ 20, Strength +5</p>
<p>After killing 1 level 15 lord and over 50 red eye lizards in an instant, Ling Chen’s level 11 exp bar finally filled up, he was now level 12! Now his Item Manipulation Technique is now level 3, reaching level 12, now means that can equip level 15 equipment!</p>
<p>Ling Chen had been waiting for this moment for a long time. He didn’t check what the Flaming Komodo Dragon had dropped, unable to hold himself back he opened his backpack and pulled out his level 15 gold boots [Wind Rider Shoes], and also his celestial sword [Zephyr Blade]</p>
<p>He took off his Silver Boots, changing it to the Wind Rider Shoes, suddenly, a mysterious glow appeared at his feet. He felt like his whole person was standing on the wind. He also changed his Sand Blade that has helped significantly, and successfully equipped the Zephyr Blade to this hand. The Zephyr Blade had a variable length, its width was greater than the Sand Blade, holding it in his hand, the weight was significantly lighter than the Sand Blade, he could barely feel the weight, moreover the green crystal body of it was gorgeous. Ling Chen raised the Zephyr Blade, and quickly swung it downwards, it released a sound of the wind.</p>
<p>The worthy celestial items, regardless of shape, attributes, special effect, was always the best. After equipping the Zephyr Blade, Ling Chen’s attack strength directly increased, his base attack was now 631. At the same time, the Zephyr Blade had an additional 20 attack speed, reaching 120 attack speed.</p>
<p>At this point, if he uses this extreme attack, and it crits, he can deal over 40k damage!! An ordinary player would not even dare imagine this number! This kind of extreme damage is at first thanks to [Soul Sacrifice], at the same time, also fully demonstrating his Ling Tian Battle Soul profession. After completing this job, he’ll be able to deal three times the damage of the extreme attack. That would still be on the lower end of skills, if he was fully leveled, who knows what level of strength could be reached.</p>
<p>The Temple Guardian Fighting Spirit is said to be the strongest job… with Ling Chen’s current abilities, he has completely destroyed the balance of this virtual reality game.</p>
<p>Ling Chen beamed with pride when playing with the Zephyr Blade, Xiao Hui also happily rushed towards the bodies of the lizards, swallowing them 5 at a time, and in no time, the dozens of red eye lizards have all been cleared out, and on the ground was 11 Elementary Strength Crystals in its place. Finally, it stood in front of the Flaming Komodo Dragon’s body, after a small pause, opened it mouth wide, and in just a few seconds, it swallowed the large body of the Flaming Komodo Dragon into its own small body. Soon after, a red crystal larger than the Elementary Strength Crystal was spat out by Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>Ling Chen quickly stepped forward and picked it up.</p>
<p>[Intermediate Strength Crystal] : Category: strength crystal, level: intermediate, attribute: fire, effect: increase physical attack by 9%</p>
<p>Swallowing the Flaming Komodo Dragon created an Intermediate Strength Crystal that couldn’t be bought anywhere at this point. Ling Chen equipped it onto the Lunar Scourge without hesitation, replacing the Elementary Strength Crystal, suddenly, his base attack raised again by a small amount, reaching 649.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui also took a little longer to transform the spirit of the Flaming Komodo Dragon. after completing the absorption, a white halo appeared above it.</p>
<p>“Ding… your pet ‘Spirit Beast’ Xiao Hui successfully leveled up, now level 10, hp +200, MP+5, defense +20.”</p>
<p>“Ding… your pet ‘Spirit Beast’ Xiao Hui learnt a new skill, Innate learnt ‘Holy Spirit’s Eye’, Innate learnt skill ‘Holy Spirit’s Aura’ increased to level 3.”</p>
<p>Spirit Beast [Xiao Hui]: Category: Pet, Level: 10, Grade: Celestial, Master: Ling Tian. Has initiative, dependent, will never betray</p>
<p>Attributes: HP: 4000, MP: 100, Physical attack: 1, Magic Attack: 1, Physical Defence: 400, Hit Rate: 1, Evasion: 1, Crit Rate: 50%, Pierce rate: 50%, Move Speed: 300.</p>
<p>Innate Gifts:</p>
<p>Can freely move about on land and water. Is especially sensitive towards dangerous aura, can sense the approaching of danger beforehand. Is very sensitive towards the smell of high-grade ores, energy crystals, energy orbs and all kinds of treasures. Can discover and accurately locate their locations from a long distance.</p>
<p>Unless it attacks or taunts others on its own, it usually will not be attacked by any creature.</p>
<p>Can help the master to quickly pick up items, after picking it up, it will appear directly in the masters backpack (Note: This is limited to owned goods, for example, monster loot, for goods that are not owned, they can only return from its mouth, and will not go directly to the masters backpack)</p>
<p>Total abnormal state, immunity to stat decrease [TLN: Not sure about this: 全异常状态、全能力下降状态免疫]</p>
<p>Innate Skills: [Holy Spirit Shield] – level 1, [Soul Devour] – Can’t be leveled, [Holy Spirit’s Gift] – level 1</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit’s Aura]: Current Level: LV3, Highest Level: LV20, Level required to upgrade to LV4: LV15, Using its Holy Spirit Aura that is void of evil and impurity to seek the protection of mother nature, upgrades the innate gifts of itself and all companions. Effect: Luck+3 and Comprehension+3 of itself along with the master and all pet companions. Effect exists even while not summoned.</p>
<p>[Holy Spirit’s Eye]: Current Level: LV1, Highest Level: LV 5, upgrading to level 5 needs: 20 levels, Using the strength of the Holy Spirit’s Eyes, a glimpse will reveal the hidden secrets of beings, the higher the level, the stronger the capacity and range.Effect: Can view any player, beast, witch, demon, god, ghost not higher than 10 levels from itself for details of the spirit, and share it directly with its master, can detect this from 50 metres around itself.</p>
<p>The newly level 10 Xiao Hui’s body has grown bigger, looking at Xiao Hui now, Ling Chen was stunned. level 10 gave Xiao Hui the ability to leap large distances. Its health and defence already made Ling Chen jealous, but now it also has a state of immunity and a debuff… these are the kind of skills only the highest levels boss have! In contrast, Ling Chen responded to the two new talents with wonder and surprised. It was a waste of time the pick up the loot after killing monsters, this was a well known fact, especially in Ling Chen’s case with his killing rate. Picking up items greatly reduced his efficiency, now with the level 10 Xiao Hui, it was able to help him pick up items. He won’t need to waste time picking items up, no doubt greatly improving farm efficiency, and allowing him to be safer.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui’s [Holy Spirit’s Eye] is a transformation that simply put, is an assistive technology that is difficult to describe. Looking at the monsters detailed information and effects compared to the collective discovery centre in the playerbase is vastly different. The discovery centre can only show basic information, and its only for monsters, but Xiao Hui’s skill can be used on all living things, giving all the “detailed information”. The basic information and detailed information are completely different. Previously when Ling Chen wanted to know some information he would have to read a “discovery scroll”, these scrolls were only obtainable through a small number of jobs, and were not sold anywhere. The usefulness of these scrolls were crystal clear to Ling Chen. When fighting his 2 hardest battles on the Mystic Moon World — the Greedy Giant Toad and the Zephyr Bird, he was able to win, but the discovery scroll played a significant role. If he didn’t know their details in advance, he would have died to the 2 celestial beasts. Master yourself, master the enemy ;}, then you would not need to fear a 100 battles, these are not empty words.</p>
<p>But now, Xiao Hui can freely use the an unlimited number of discovery scrolls! Xiao Hui’s [Holy Spirit’s Eye] will be of incalculable use to the enemies that Ling Chen will face in the future. At the same time, Holy Spirit’s Eye will not only be able to access detail information, but it can also find the hidden scenarios [TLN: Not sure about this, maybe it refers to quests?]. Holy Spirit’s Eye highest level is level 5, but level 1 is already so strong. With a fully leveled Holy Spirit’s Eye, the strength of the effect will be simply unimaginable.</p>
<p>Even though Xiao Hui has no attacking ability, Lin Chen has began to feel its ‘Celestial’ grade on Xiao Hui, he had misunderstood it. If there was ever a time or chance where a Heavenly End class attacking type pet could be chosen, he believed that he would still choose Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>The newly leveled Xiao Hui happily jumped around several times, making whooping sounds, quickly running towards the spoils. Suddenly, Ling Chen saw a scene, where Xiao Hui was simply running, with its 300 movespeed, running like the wind and lightning, and the places where he has been, the ground had all kinds of items; coins, potions, crystals, and even pieces of equips, everything was being attracted to Xiao Hui’s body. When the items touch its body, they strangely disappear… then they directly appear in the Ling Chen’s backpack. [TLN: Autoloot op]</p>
<p>Running a circle in an area that was filled with corpses, in a few seconds, the 50+ lizards on the ground drops were all cleared out. In this time, all Xiao Hui did was run, not doing anything else. Everything appeared in his backpack.</p>
<p>Ling Chen finally experienced the speed of the natural ability of “Auto Looting” [TLN: Direct translation is rapid seizure] , this speed… was really something that couldn’t be described.</p>
<p>Ling Chen shortened his body, and patted Xiao Hui’s head, feeling emotional: “Xiao Hui, you have shown such great ability, your history, what exactly is it…”</p>
<p>Xiao Hui could hear him, it tilted its head, but it couldn’t understand what the words meant. It also immediately saw Ling Chen after birth so there was no way it would know its own true origins. It also didn’t have any interest in its own origins. After Ling Chen became its master, its sole purpose became to live with him.</p>

<p>Ling Chen began to go through his backpack. The gold coins dropped from 55 lizards barely added up to 10. There were also many low level potions and there was only one white equip that could be sold at the store. The Flaming Komodo Dragon had only dropped one equip, a level 15 silver undergarment.</p>
<p>[Tenacious Leggings]: Category: Undergarment, Grade: Silver, Equip Requirements: level 15 and level 15 or above in any occupation. It is unknown what these leggings are made out of, but they are extra solid, however it seems to be hiding a mysterious power. Attributes: Defense: +20, Strength: +7, Stamina: +7, Earth resistance: +3%.</p>
<p>Even with a Lord type Boss, it was not easy to get gold equips. If golden equips dropped so easily, even if it was not a bad avenue [TLN: Thats what raw says, maybe its referring to the place where the Lizards spawn?] , it wouldn’t be rare to the point of the early stage (maybe low quality?) artifacts. Even though the Tenacious Leggings were available for all occupations, its attributes were particularly useful for Ling Chen, so he equipped it without hesitation. He then continued to go through his backpack, then he realized, he had over a thousand elementary strength crystals!</p>
<p>Even if he just sold it to the store, he could make over 80,000 gold coins!! This number of gold coins at this stage was an astronomical figure. There was nothing he couldn’t buy, at least in Azure Dragon city, with the income that was brought in by Xiao Hui. Looking at these elementary strength crystals, Ling Chen was filled with energy, and rushed towards the nearby newly spawned Red Eye Lizards. Dedicating the vast map to leveling, with the denseness of the repawned groups of monsters, coupled with Ling Chen’s high level, no one could take his kills. Here he could achieve a leveling speed that would leave other players breathless, whilst also making a large profit.</p>
<p>[Red Eye Lizard]: Category: Beast, Level: 15, HP: 650, Strangely shaped lizard that possesses red pupils, its body will occasionally shoot out sparks, due to this it commonly creates small scale fire disasters on The Plains. Talent: Fire resistance 30%, immune to common poison attacks, higher defense, fast move speed.</p>
<p>Methods of attack: [Tail Whip]: Suddenly whipping their tail to hit a single enemy, after hitting it will move back 2 body lengths, attack speed is fast, hard to prevent.</p>
<p>That day, Ling Chen killed a days worth of Red Eye Lizards and even with Heaven’s Jealousy on his body, his experience still steadily rose.</p>
<p>Ling Shui Ruo was online for 8 hours before being called by Ling Chen to go offline. When she went offline, her level was almost level 3. This was obviously to the credit of the two “sisters” she brought, otherwise she would lack attack damage as a trainee priest, and with one person it would be very hard to level up. Letting Shui Ruo play for 8 hours a day was already Ling Chen’s limit. He could see that Shui Ruo really liked Mystic Moon. When leaving the game she made a sound of dismay. In the past, her world was just spent dully sleeping, but now, her life finally had some excitement. She finally found a way to enjoy something that normal people enjoy.</p>
<p>After Shui Ruo went to bed, Ling Chen returned to the Mystic Moon world, continuing to eradicate the Red Eye Lizards. Altogether, his time spent in a day online was around 10 hours. He needed to spend a large amount of time taking care of Shui Ruo, so his time spent online could not be compared to those leveling like madmen. Moreover there was the “Heaven’s Jealousy” which covered his head. Nevertheless, because of the speed in which he killed the Red Eye Lizard, he was second to no one in in terms of leveling speed.</p>
<p>He spent the whole evening killing Red Eye Lizards.</p>
<p>The second day, again, he killed a days worth of Red Eye Lizards. Looking at these giant lizards crawling all over the ground, his eyes were getting numb. Dead or alive, there was no difference in his eyes.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, Ling Chen’s level 12 exp bar finally filled, leveling to level 13. Ling Chen let out a sigh of relief. Leveling is a very boring affair, these past two days were boring to an extreme level. It was just him in this place, there wasn’t even a shadow of the other players. No one talked to him, not even a snatching monster, passerby, or even a robber, the only one by his side was Xiao Hui following him around, then it was all just Red Eye Lizards and occasionally 1 star, 2 star or 3 star elites. After leveling up Ling Chen paused for a bit. Nearby, more Red Eye Lizards were spawning, seeing these giant lizards crawling around made Ling Chen felt like throwing up.</p>
<p>“Ding… congratulations your pet spirit beast ‘Xiao Hui’ leveled up, now level 12, HP +200, MP +5, defense +20.”</p>
<p>Xiao Hui’s leveling speed was faster than his own, he only just reached level 13 and Xiao Hui reached level 12 at the same time. The difference between their levels was only 1 now. Ling Chen couldn’t help but feel a little jealousy.</p>
<p>It was already 4pm so Ling Chen no longer stayed in the Red Eye Lizard territory, but instead he took out his return scroll and went back to Azure Dragon City.</p>
<p>Ling Chen first went to the pawnshop, getting rid of all the white equips and items that he doesn’t use, getting over 50 gold coins. After thinking about it, he took out 30 elementary strength crystal and sold them for 240 gold coins. Then, taking roughly 300 gold coins straight to the equip store he bought 600 bottles of instant 800HP restore green potions and 1200 bottles of instant 200MP restore dark green potions. Even though there were a lot, it only used up 9 storage spaces. A reserve like this would be enough to last for a long time. He then counted up the rest of the elementary strength crystals, and headed straight for the Azure Dragon City delivery store.</p>
<p>Azure Dragon City’s largest delivery shop was empty, because this store regardless of whether you are selling or sending, it was only for the players. Seeing Ling Chen come over, a middle aged female boss came over and welcomed him with a smile: “How are you, young brother, you must be from a different world. Is there anything you need delivered? The shop is newly opened so there are great discounts. One small item per day only costs 5 gold, a bigger item would cost 10-100 a day and after the sale we only take a commission of 5%.”</p>
<p>The consignment shops set up by the NPCs in this virtual game are very shady. This was generally accepted, not only did it take a fee for storing the items by day, it also took a large commission when goods were sold. So, generally players bought consignment goods from other players, particularly those who were powerful. There were consignment shops by prestigious guilds, with low fees and also low sales commissions, some don’t even need a commission. But at present, there was no way there was a consignment shop opened by players, so this was his only option.</p>
<p>“A consignment of 3000 elementary strength crystals.” Ling Chen showed his 3000 elementary strength crystals then he then took out 15 gold coins. The consignment was not calculated by piece, but by class. Regardless of the number consigned, it was counted as one. Items as small as potions, scrolls, and as big as weapons with identical attributes. Even if you come up with 80,000 pieces of the same object, it will all be automatically placed into the same spot by the consignment shop. Elementary strength crystals were considered a small object, so all 3000 of them only needed 5 gold coins a day, so 15 gold coins were enough for the consignment of 3 days.</p>
<p>All 3000 elementary strength crystals almost blinded the consignment shop female boss’ eyes. Her mouth was wide open, it was wide enough to put a rubber ball in. Only after a while did she stammer: “Young brother, where did you get all these elementary strength crystals, its simply amazing!”</p>
<p>“Do I need to report the source of the items I’m trying to consign?” Ling Chen asked with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“No need, no need.” the female boss shook her head, quickly taking all the elementary strength crystals and the 15 gold coins. “15 gold coins, consignment for 3 days and a total of 3000 items, how much did you want to sell the items for?”</p>
<p>“150 gold coins.”</p>
<p>“Okay. If there is a sale, after the commission of 5% is deducted, it will be transferred to your bag automatically. If three days had passed and not all the goods have been sold, and you don’t return to renew it, all the goods that are not sold will be returned directly to your backpack.”</p>
<p>When there is a sale to a player the gold coins will be automatically given where ever you are, this is the biggest advantage of consignment at an NPC shop. Consigning with a player store means you’ll have to collect the gold yourself. So, even though consigning with NPC store is shady, many players will still choose to do so. </p>
<p>If 3000 elementary strength crystal were sold to the pawnshop, one could make 24,000 gold coins!! Ling Chen obtained these, in a span of 2 days and 1 night. At the moment he has consigned them at the Azure Dragon City store, selling at 150 gold each, cheaper by 50 gold coins than the equipment shop. 50 gold is by no means a small amount and from the tonight, there will be a lot of players going into Azure Dragon City. At that time, there should be a lot of a players going to buy it.</p>
<p>After dealing with everything, Ling Chen called his Cloud-Stepping Mare, and headed east. After leveling to level 13, he had already decided not to stay, but instead headed directly for the Silent Soul Ridge. Although he had a month for the task, its always better to be early than late. It was over 200km away, with his current speed, and if the mare doesn’t stop, he should be there in roughly 10 hours. Of course, this was an impossible ideal… Travelling along the unpredictable terrain and potentially facing monsters, it is likely that it will take several times longer.</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t expect it to be too bad. When night began to fall in the real world, Azure Dragon Square started bustling with player silhouettes, but it was still only a small amount. These players are all the top Chinese players, and when it was midnight, Azure Dragon Plaza started to have groups of players appear. The centre transfer hall was packed with players. Upon reaching the next day, the scary gangs frightened the 7 Job Instructors who couldn’t wait to dig a hole and escape.</p>
<p>[TLN: Heaven’s Jealousy makes him require 2x more exp to level up I believe.]</p>
<p>TEASER ( I THINK):</p>
<p>[After several boring chapters, its time to finally get down to business. There will be a mysterious businessman, Lolis, attack pets… Xiao Hui is a pure support pet, but it is completely different to the evil pure support in the Evil Dragon. The next kind of pet that will appear is a pure attack pet, but it will also be completely different from the evil pure attack pet in the Evil Dragon… do you think a God Horse monster will appear?]</p>
<p>[TLN: Not sure what Evil Dragon is..]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>When players began to flood into Azure Dragon city, Ling Chen used this time to ride his horse.</p>
<p>After the plains was the mountain forest area. The mountain forest area contained level 20 to 30 monsters of different varieties. There were also all kinds of hidden traps, it was much more dangerous than the plains. After the mountain forest there was a medium sized town. In Mystic Moon, other than the main city, there are second cities, large, medium and small cities and numerous villages. These towns outside the main city will sell return scrolls to those villages, because, these towns not only provide a large variety of big and small hidden quests but it also provides supplies. Moreover using the return scrolls to these towns can be used for faster travel. So, with every town Ling Chen goes through, he would stop and buy the town’s return scroll, then he would find an NPC to tell him the most convenient way to the Silent Spirit Ridge.</p>
<p>The hidden tasks were not hard like pit father [TLN: Not sure what this is, (坑爹) will go back and check later], however the first step of the task was already difficult. Travelling East from Azure Dragon City for 200km, if you just run you won’t just be running for a long time, but there are also countless monsters on the way, and later in the journey, the monsters are higher level. Attempting to get through all the high level monsters’ territory safely to reach the mission point is not something an average player would be able to do.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s horse galloped nonstop, running from the evening to the early hours of the morning. He was aware that the more East he went, the lower number of towns and the number of people also became more sparse. He was now in a desolate place, the big and small mountains were chaotically arranged. Running up the mountains is significantly harder than leaving Azure Dragon City. In addition, it was obvious that this place was a good place to find all sorts of beasts. So on this road, Ling Chen never let his guard down and always paid attention to his surroundings. At Level 13, this was a top level among the player base, even if he didn’t level for three days no one would be able to catch up, but in this whole Forgotten Continent, his strength was the absolute lowest. And in this dangerous place, any monster that jumped out was able to kill him.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the level 45 Sawtooth Blood Panther territory, Ling Chen reached a safe zone before finally stopping. When he was going to go offline, his intercom rang, broadcasting Yun Feng’s voice.</p>
<p>“Haha, Ling Chen! Did you hear, I spent a whole night desperately trying to level and now I’ve finally reached Azure Dragon City. I’m now by the square… fuck, the number of players here is intimidating, the transfer hall is completely crowded. Oh yeah, where are you? My sister hoped that I’d be here by last night, and already transferred. How about I take you to see her? If she finds out that the helper I found for her was you, she’ll be pleasantly surprised.”</p>
<p>“Your sister wants to create a guild called ‘Dream’, right?” Ling Chen responded.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How many people are there?”</p>
<p>“err… *cough cough*, honestly, ‘Dream’ till now still hasn’t been successfully created. It didn’t occur in the previous world either, so there are no core members, so, only after reaching Azure Dragon City can the development begin. And also, at first, it can only be the smallest type of guilds — in the form of a studio, then only can it slowly grow bigger. Right now, including you, there are… 5 people.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“Aish, I know that this number is appalling as well, but… aiish, no matter what, I couldn’t just sit by idly. This is her last fight, and I know how she is, even if it appears impossible, she still wants to try… She says, even if its a small, almost invisible ray of hope, it is still hope. This means that there is a faint possibility, so if you dare not even try and just give up, that would be a real tragedy.” Yun Feng, sighed a few more times. All long, from what he said to what he did, Ling Chen could feel his love towards his sister, the same way he loved Shui Ruo.</p>
<p>Ling Chen was silent for a moment, then he said: “This was the reason she gave?”</p>
<p>“yep.”</p>
<p>In that moment, he gained the desires of a certain person named “Yun Meng Xin”. At least in terms of their persistent attitude, they were similar.</p>
<p>“I only just reached Azure Dragon City, there are a lot of errands to deal with, I’ll take 1 or 2 days to settle in. I also have a task to complete. With regards to meeting her, I’ll talk to you about it in 1 to 2 days.” Ling Chen said. Because of Shui Ruo, he will definitely help Yun Meng Xin, to fulfill Yun Feng’s expectations. But helping a girl who effectively has nothing in two days, this was going to be really difficult.</p>
<p>“No problem! When you’re free just contract me! Oh yeah, that Soaring Cloud…”</p>
<p>pa!</p>
<p>Ling Chen hung up and went offline to make Shui Ruo some breakfast.</p>
<p>After noon, Peace town.</p>
<p>In accordance with what the Azure Dragon City mayor said, Peace Town was the closest town to Silent Soul Ridge. If you continued East, you wouldn’t find anyone anymore, because in less than 15km, is the feared “Ghastly Grounds”. After the Ghastly grounds lies Silent Soul Ridge, the place where no one has entered and lived to tell the tale. Peace Town’s name also comes from the fact that the villages use the place to pray for peace. After all, it is so close to such dangerous places so they cant help but worry that a catastrophe could happen at any moment.</p>
<p>Reaching Peace Town meant that he was really close to Silent Soul Ridge.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, Ling Chen didn’t spend any more time leveling and was really eager to come here. The main reason was to gather information as soon as possible, then he can spend a sufficient amount of time to prepare. His strength compared to all of the Forgotten Continent was at the lowest of the low. Many high level players from the Forgotten Continent didn’t come back alive after entering the Silent Soul Ridge. He couldn’t find a reason as to why he would be any better than them.</p>
<p>Peace Town was small, the whole town only had a few hundred people, but the shops had everything. But, aside from the main city, all other city’s equip stores don’t sell strength crystals. Obviously, selling crystals was the privilege of the main city.</p>
<p>“ Uncle, how are you, how do I get to Silent Soul Ridge?” Peace Town’s residents were all fairly closed families, barely any pedestrians could be seen. Ling Chen did not easily find anyone, so he quickly stepped forward to ask his question.</p>
<p>“Oh, its about 15km northeast from here… what!? You want to go the Silent Soul Ridge?” the middle aged man responded with a startled look. He then quickly blocked the way: “Young man, you must an adventurer? Don’t ever go to the Silent Soul Ridge, that is a place of death, no man that has been there has ever come back alive! I’ve lived here for many years, even thinking of Silent Soul Ridge’s name makes me feel a chill, never ever go there!”</p>
<p>The middle aged man’s fear on his face was not false in the slightest, as the town closest to the Silent Soul Ridge, even the name would incite fear. One can only imagine how horrible the place is. Ling Chen asked: “Why is that place so scary? Are there really strong monsters inside?”</p>
<p>“Aish, no one really knows.” the middle aged man shook his head: “In front of the Silent Soul Ridge are the Ghastly Grounds. Within Ghastly Grounds, it is surrounded by an undead gas. Within the gas, there are also herds of terrible spirits and zombies. Whoever goes near would start to get dizzy and their body would feel weak. Our ancestors said that the place was filled with a vast amount of undead gas released by the undead, which can devour human life.</p>
<p>The undead gas in the Ghastly Grounds, although it is scary, it can be prepared for. It is not hopeless. Our town is only a few kms away from the Ghastly Grounds, and sometimes the undead gas still reaches here. So, the village has long since developed methods of resisting the undead gas. But even then, once you pass through the Ghastly Grounds, into the Silent Soul Ridge, you will disappear off the face of the earth and never return. Young man, you must be an adventurer from another world right? Otherwise, you would definitely know about the fear of the Silent Soul Ridge. It is known throughout the Forgotten Continent as the top feared and restricted area, never ever go there.”</p>
<p>Undead gas?</p>
<p>Ling Chen nodded: “I now know, thanks for telling me. Oh yeah, you were talking about a method that could resist the undead gas, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that is our town’s special food. After eating it, you can mitigate the impacts of the undead gas, and its also really yummy. I’ve been having it for many years and I still haven’t had enough. This food is sold everywhere, I believe that after you’ve tried it, you’ll understand that this taste can only be acquired in heaven!” the middle aged man pointed at a closed door and said, with a look of satisfaction on his face, he seemed to be able to taste the “taste that can only be acquired in heaven”.</p>
<p>Ling Chen remembered the location of the house and continued to ask: “At the Silent Soul Ridge, is there a plant named ‘Black Inflamed Grass’?”</p>
<p>The middle aged man nodded: “On the ancient records of the Silent Soul Ridge, there is a message about the Black Inflamed Grass. But since the Silent Soul Ridge had become off limits, whether the Black Inflamed Grass is still there no one knows. Speaking of which, some time ago a few parties were looking for the Black Inflamed Grass. They didn’t listen to our warnings and went to the Silent Soul Ridge, even until now they haven’t returned. They must have also been turned into the undead. Young man, remember my words, never ever go there. That place is scarier than what you can imagine.”</p>
<p>After talking to the middle aged man, Ling Chen stayed in Peace Town for a long time. Every time he saw a resident he would go and ask them questions, but he didn’t obtain any more useful information. Hearing the words “Silent Soul Ridge” causes a look of fear, then they would just try to stop him from going there. He stopped trying to ask. Ling Chen went to the middle aged man’s house and opened the door and some white hot air burst out.</p>
<p>“How are you, adventurer of a faraway land, come drink our special delicacy and enjoy the coolness that will flood your body. I believe that after you try it, you would definitely understand the taste that can only be acquired in heaven! And even desire to stay here forever, living with this amazing taste.” A skinny old man carrying a steamy big bowl, with a grin said.</p>
<p>… what is this food? is it really that good? Ling Chen looked at the big bowl.</p>
<p>Rice porridge: Boiled rice porridge, after eating it will, user will gain 10 HP recovery. Within 10 minutes it will mitigate the effects of undead gas. Price: 3 silver coins.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: ! @#￥%……”</p>
<p>“Bring 20 bowls.” Ling Chen quickly said, skipping the small talk and taking out 6 gold coins, giving it to the old man. 20 bowls of hot porridge will last 200 minutes. He came here to explore. He didn’t think he would complete the task so 20 bowls should be enough. More importantly, he remembered that when leaving Azure Dragon City he only had a few gold coins left. He can’t buy too many even if he wanted to.</p>
<p>Thus, after preparing 20 bowls of steaming hot porridge he went to his Cloud Stepping Mare and headed northeast straight for the Silent Soul Ridge.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Peace Town was surrounded by green grass, but if you go east, the vegetation becomes noticeably sparse and the colour of the grass also becomes increasingly weird. At the same time the road was harder to walk on as you couldn’t really find any flat ground. Obviously, normally nothing would set foot on this land. Ling Chen raised his head and looked at the sky, it was grey, almost like a thick layer of black. Every time he moved a little more forward, he could clearly notice the light dimming. In front of him, the air was also beginning to turn grey.</p>
<p>Was this the undead gas getting stronger that the Peace Town residents were talking about?</p>
<p>Dying is life’s right, the undead gas will slowly devour life, especially if the life is fragile. In an environment where it is completely surrounded by the undead gas, death will come even quicker. The slight heaviness told Ling Chen that the undead gas ahead will get thicker, also because of the undead gas getting too thick, the whole way he didn’t see any birds or beasts, let alone people.</p>
<p>After travelling for half an hour, it was the last stretch of the Ghastly Grounds. Ling Chen slowed down a little just so he can focus on dealing with any sudden situations that might happen in front of him. At this time, a light flashed brightly into his eyes. The source of the light was from the sharp point on Xiao Hui’s head.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui had been sleeping on the Cloud Stepping Mare’s head and when its forehead point shined, its eyes opened in an instant. Its two ears stood up with a “whoosh”, then it quickly stood up, sniffing the air. It suddenly jumped from the Cloud Stepping Nare and rushed towards Ling Chen making “wu wu” sounds, then quickly ran off to the left.</p>
<p>“ Xiao Hui, where are you going?”</p>
<p>Ling Chen just called out, but his already knew what it was. Before on the War God training grounds, when Xiao Hui suddenly sprang out, its forehead point also shined. Then, it brought back striker beads.</p>
<p>What did it realise?</p>
<p>Ling Chen followed Xiao Hui without hesitation. Xiao Hui intentionally slowed down so that the Cloud Stepping Mare could keep up. After running for not more than 100km, Xiao Hui stopped and stood by a 200m tall rock wall, exposing half its head from the rock, staring motionlessly forwards.</p>
<p>Ling Chen stopped as well. He climbed down from the Cloud Stepping Mare, and was about to speak when a voice that made his entire body go numb flooded his mind: “Shh, young master, do not make a sound, if you scared away that fat cat, it would be a pity.”</p>
<p>“Fat cat? what does that mean?” Ling Chen asked with his mind.</p>
<p>“Young master should go see, then he will understand, but, take light steps as that fat cat is very alert.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t make a sound and returned the Cloud Stepping Mare. He took light steps and walked to Xiao Hui’s side. Pressing his body up against the rock, he slowly moved and poked his head out from the side of the rock. Looking in front, his eyelids fluttered.</p>
<p>This is a rugged rock area, almost to the point where no vegetation exists. All there is are big and small rocks of different shapes. 50m in front of him there were 2 dozen metre high rocks, and where these two rocks meet, a gold obese body with its back turned to him was twisting around with its butt. Looking at this shape it seemed to be hugging something.</p>
<p>This was close to the Ghastly Grounds so it had at least a little undead gas but it still had an animal and that animal was golden! But since its back was facing Ling Chen, he couldn’t tell what animal it was.</p>
<p>“What is that?” Ling Chen asked in his mind. Based on what Qi Yue said before, she seemed to know what this was. That is to say, this animal has existed for 10,000 years and it seemed like some kind of great thing.</p>
<p>Ling Chen had just finished what he was saying when the shining golden animal suddenly stopped doing the twisting action. “Swoosh!” it turned its body and in the moment it turned around, Ling Chen got to see its whole body. Its cat face was as big as a washbasin, its body was round like a ball, its limbs were short and thick, its four paws were exceptionally large, its yellow tail dragged on the ground, and the source of its golden light was not from its body, but from the golden bell hanging around its neck!</p>
<p>The standing posture of the golden fat cat was really funny.</p>
<p>Ling Chen used his Concealing Breathing Ability. If Ling Chen dared say second, then no one would dare say first. [TLN: Not sure what this means] The fat cat alertly looked around for a while, but did not detect the presence of Ling Chen so it turned back around and started using its claws to play with something. At this time, Ling Chen’s mind received information from the “Holy Spirit’s Eye” from Xiao Hui.</p>
<p>[Lucky Cat]: category: spirit, level: 0, grade: none, HP: 894154198.</p>
<p>The cat was actually called Lucky Cat…</p>
<p>Okay, what its called is unimportant, but when Ling Chen saw its HP, he felt weak and and was about to fall.</p>
<p>one… ten… hundred… thousand… ten thousand… it was as if his eyes were deceiving him. Its health… its close to 900 million!?!?</p>
<p>Level 0 and without a class, the fat cat had almost 900 million HP!! This number would cause normal players to gasp in shock. Ling Chen shook his head quickly and continued to look at the information on the Fortune Cat. What exactly is this super monster!</p>
<p>[ Lucky Cat]: … numerous treasures from the ancient times released an aura and Nature’s breath of life combined together. After countless years of evolution into treasure creatures, they were extremely sensitive to all kinds of treasures and have a sensitive perception. It lives to collect all kinds of world treasures and travels for it. Its body contains lots of money and countless treasures. Rumour has it that whoever can catch it, can use its large amount of money and treasure to exchange for its freedom. But to date, it is unheard of anyone catching it.</p>
<p>Talents: High speed, extreme alertness, can see through any kind of stealthing.</p>
<p>Natural Skills: [Money Shield]: Any damage taken will cause money to drop instead. However much money it has is how much HP it has. The dropped money can be picked up right away by it but when its money reaches 0, it will immediately die.</p>
<p>[Money Attack]: Throws money out at a single target within 10m. It will deal however much damage as money is thrown. An unlimited amount of money can be thrown at once. Money thrown can be picked up.</p>
<p>[Money Escape]: While its free, it can rapidly throw down 100 gold coins. Then the forces of nature will teleport it to a random place on the Forgotten Continent.</p>
<p>[Treasure Strange Call]: Calls for a random piece of treasure to appear. The treasure has no attack power but can keep the target occupied while it escapes.</p>
<p>[Lucky Hand]: When close to the target it stretches its paw, stealing all the gold of the target in a moment and the target will not be aware of it.</p>
<p>[True lucky hand]: When close to the target it stretches its paw, stealing all the gold and items of the target in a moment and the target will not be aware of it.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>After reading the cat’s abilities, Ling Chen’s forehead had a fine layer of sweat.</p>
<p>This is such a strange monster, was what he was internally screaming.</p>
<p>Using gold as HP it has close to 900 million HP, which means it holds nearly 900million gold coins! 900 million! Even if the cat sat there without moving, he didn’t know how long it would take to take away all the money. Whats even more insane is that the money that it knocks out can be picked back up! The scariest thing is the money attack. The money thrown has no limit so if it decides to use all of its money in the attack…</p>
<p>It could deal up to 900 million damage in one attack!! It could even one shot mythical beasts!</p>
<p>As for its [Lucky hand]…</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s body shrunk as he subconsciously looked at his own backpack.</p>
<p>What kind of monster is this! Ling Chen groaned internally.</p>
<p>As if it heard Ling Chen’s internal voice, Qi Yue said with a smile: “Young master, that is not a monster. Its name is called Lucky Cat, it is a spirit! The spirit of Heaven and earth, which was conceived through the breath of countless treasures and Nature’s breath of life. It has 2 strong abilities, one of which, is to collect all kinds of treasures and it must be the most precious of treasures. Most treasures it doesn’t bother touching. The other ability…”</p>
<p>“Is to steal things?”</p>
<p>“Nope, to run away.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“Lucky Cat’s ability to escape a battle is unique. Even if its the Moon God Clan’s top three Goddesses, they can’t guarantee to can catch it. Ever since it appeared, countless number of people on Forgotten Continent want to catch it. This is because catching it would make it possible to get the treasures on its body, but it seems like so far no one has ever succeeded. But, it still has a weakness.”</p>
<p>“What is its weakness?”</p>
<p>“Its timid… Even if the most common rabbits appear next to it, it will run away immediately. Hehe, young mater, do you want to try and catch it? If you can catch it, the loot would be ludicrous.” Yi Que softly said.</p>
<p>“… Do you think I can catch it?” Ling Chen grinned. The information on this fat cat clearly says that its “very fast, has high perception, and can detect all kinds of stealth”, but it doesn’t know what the system deems as “very fast”. However its probably significantly faster than his own max speed. Moreover, the fat cat has the “Money Escape” ability. Randomly throwing down 100 gold coins and it can be sent to any part of the forgotten continent… With this ability, who could possibly catch it?</p>
<p>“Nope!” Yi Que laughed softly, and answered simply. “But, young master could give it a try. The cat usually doesn’t appear in places where there are many people. Just being able to encounter it is a type of privilege that is hard to come by, so no matter what you need to give it a try. Even if you fail you won’t lose anything. Don’t be afraid of its money attack as the fat cat regards money more important than life. Unless it absolutely needs to, it won’t throw its money.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t say anymore. Holding his breath, he looked at the lucky cat again and just at this time, the cat stopped moving to look at its surroundings. Its alertness is not that high. Even in a place where there are no humans, he still frequently looks around. Unfortunately, just as Ling Chen moved out of sight the lucky cat happened to see him….</p>
<p>“Miao~~~~”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Aiya, you’ve been noticed.” Yi Que cried out with a smile. With Lucky Cat’s detection skills, being detected at this close distance was bound to happen.</p>
<p>Ling Chen knew that he had been discovered so he didn’t need to hide anymore. He walked out from behind the rock wall but unexpectedly, the fat cat didn’t think of running away after seeing him, but instead made “meowing” sounds. The cat claw suddenly tossed a dark object that flew towards Ling Chen. Then it quickly turned around. Clenching its buttocks, it quickly returned to hugging whatever it was holding onto before. Its speed dramatically increased.</p>
<p>Why wasn’t it running?</p>
<p>While Ling Chen was surprised, the dark object that the Lucky Cat threw was already right in front of him. Ling Chen focused his vision by widening his eyes…. A round shape that seemed to be made out of some kind of black metal. It was made of one material with a bit that could be held like a handle…</p>
<p>It looked alot like a pan!</p>
<p>“Its a strange treasure! Young master, quickly beat this strange treasure. If you can beat it before the cat can take it back, this treasure is yours! Quickly!!” Yi Que said with excitement. In most situations, the Lucky Cat would choose to run. It wouldn’t summon a treasure to engage in battle because if the strange treasure was defeated by an opponent in a short time then it would be obtained by the opponent, causing it to lose a treasure. All the treasures on the Lucky Cat’s body are very rare and are worth at least 10,000 gold coins. Normal treasures don’t attract it. It won’t even touch those, let alone keep them on its body.</p>
<p>It was facing this situation and not running away, but instead calling a strange treasure can only mean one thing… There is something that is greatly attracting it, making it not want to leave!</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s voice sounded as the dark object that the fat cat threw was over Ling Chen’s head, then it flew downwards aggressively. Ling Chen’s eyebrows pricked. He quickly jumped away, then his brain received the information from Xiao Hui’s Holy Spirit’s Eye.</p>
<p>[Handsome Pan]: Category: Spirit, Level: 0, Grade: none. HP: 5000, A self appointed handsome frying pan. Legend says if it is used to cook, it will produce the most delicious food in the world.</p>
<p>Talents: None.</p>
<p>Attacking Techniques: [Eat my pot]: Using the body of the pan to swing at the target’s head. It does not deal any damage, but if it hits, there is a 100% chance that the target will be dizzy for at least 5 seconds. If you are locked down and continually hit, then you will continue to be dizzy.</p>
<p>Hiding ability: [Morph]: Effect Unknown.</p>
<p>Ling Chen: ⊙﹏⊙b…………</p>
<p>“Young master, you need to hurry up and defeat it! Lucky Cat’s summon duration of the strange treasure is a short. The cat will also call it back if it thinks that it will be stolen away. The best thing you can do is to kill it in one hit!” Yi Que cautioned.</p>
<p>It deals no damage and only adds dizziness– but once hit it has 100% chance! Moreover you only need to be hit once, then once dizzy you will just be continually hit, continuously being dizzy until it stops hitting.</p>
<p>“Soul Sacrifice!!”</p>
<p>This pan has no damage so it cannot harm him, therefore there would be no pressure in him using soul sacrifice. The speed of the frying pan is quite fast. Ling Chen just finished casting and it was already flying towards him, aiming at his head and swinging down. </p>
<p>Pa!!</p>
<p>With Ling Chen’s swift retreat, the Handsome Pan smacked the rocks. Ling Chen’s eye narrowed. Poising with his hands together, he used two “Ling Tian Slash” to hit the pan.</p>
<p>Pa! Pa!</p>
<p> -6617，-6610</p>
<p>Ling Chen in the Soul Sacrifice state had an extremely high attack power. With one hit and shot, the Handsome Pan lost all its HP in an instant. The pan that was about to fly to him suddenly fell to the ground. Its whole body shook twice, then it suddenly flew up.</p>
<p>Ling Chen retreated quickly… What?! Didn’t it have 5000HP?</p>
<p>Could it be….</p>
<p>The pan not only flew again, but while flying its size increased, bigger and bigger. 2 times, 3 times… 5 times… 10times!!</p>
<p>Finally appearing before Ling Chen’s eyes, it was now a extra large pan with a diameter of 3 metres.</p>
<p>[Super Big Handsome Pan]: Category: Spirit, level: 0, Grade: none. HP: 50000, A self appointed handsome frying pan. Legend says if it is used to cook, it will produce the most delicious food in the world.</p>
<p>Talents: None.</p>
<p>Attacking Techniques: [Eat my pot again]: Using the body of the pan to envelop the target’s head it does not deal any damage, but if it hits, there is a 100% chance that the target will be dizzy for at least 10 seconds. If you are locked down and continually hit, then you will continue to be dizzy.</p>
<p>Ling Chen rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>Previously, the little pan was fun to play with, but now when a 3 metre sized Handsome Pan came down it, it wasn’t fun anymore. Its HP also increased by 10 times. Looking at the dark coloured pan ahead, Ling Chen’s heart began to sink.</p>
<p>At this time, the Lucky Cat that was hugging something suddenly turned around. Seeing that the pan had already morphed, its big face looked a little confused. Its front two paws suddenly start vibrating.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the super big handsome pan that was flying towards Ling Chen, ready to swing down suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>“Oops, the Lucky Cat wants to return the treasure!! Quickly kill it… you only have one chance!!” Yi Que quickly cried.</p>
<p>Seeing the Lucky Cat’s actions, Ling Chen also knew its intentions, but with the Super Big Handsome pan’s 50,000 HP, it wasn’t easy to just one shot it!</p>
<p>Got it!!</p>
<p>“Battle Soul Possession!!”</p>
<p>A colourless and shapeless light energy shrouded the light of Soul Sacrifice. With Soul Sacrifice and Battle Soul Possession, the next attack will be the highest attack that Ling Chen can achieve. In that moment, the Super Big Handsome Pan began to return to the cat. With its previously demonstrated flying speed, if it wanted to fly away, Ling Chen would never be able to catch it. He did not dare to delay any longer. Ling Chen fiercely jumped forwards, right hand using the Soaring Cloud “Ling Tian slash”, left hand with the Zephyr Blade using “Four Corners Star Formation”, instantly casting them.</p>
<p>Unrivaled power was released. The surging destructive power formed the shape of four corners of an array. “Battle Soul Sacrifice” and “Soul Possession” buff’s resulted in tremendous power that was all placed onto the body of the super big pan.</p>
<p>bang! bang!</p>
<p> -25208，-13234！</p>
<p>Battle Soul Possession’s effect only works for the “next” attack and since both attacks from Ling Chen’s hands were simultaneous, it was considered as Ling Chen’s self created “next attack”. So, the Four Corners Star Formation and Ling Tian Slash all triggered the effect of the Battle Soul Possession, stacking together, dealing over 38,000 damage. But these two attacks unfortunately didn’t even crit once.</p>
<p>The Super Big Handsome Pot with still over 10k HP, without saying anything, like it was being swept in the wind flew back to the Lucky Cat with a “Whoosh”. The speed was almost comparable to the running speed of Xiao Hui. The effect of the Soul Sacrifice still remained even after the two heavy attacks. Ling Chen couldn’t stop half way. His right hand was raised, his body has turned and the Soaring Cloud in his hand turned into a silver meteor and flew off…</p>
<p>Bang!!!</p>
<p>The Super Big Handsome Pan flew even faster, but it wasn’t as fast as the [Soaring Cloud Flying]. It could only fly 20m before being heavily hit by Soaring Cloud.</p>
<p> -18906</p>
<p>A beautiful digital crit number appeared in the air and the large frying pan, under the impact of the Soaring Cloud started to spin like a large windmill and then fell to the ground. It started to roll in Ling Chen’s direction. The rolling then started to slow, but it kept rolling until it was at Ling Chen’s feet before stopping. At the same time it transformed back to the original size. Ling Chen quickly moved towards it. As it no longer had any HP, it was no longer a monster pan so he picked it up.</p>
<p>Yi Que said that the Lucky Cat’s body’s items were all world treasures so being able to get even one item from its body was what people dreamed of. Ling Chen naturally picked it up as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>But… this pan… doesn’t even look like a treasure!</p>
<p>[Handsome pan]: Special Cooking item, grade unknown. A self appointed Handsome Frying Pan. Legend says if it is used to cook, it will produce the most delicious food in the world. However it seems that nobody knows how to use the pan.</p>
<p>Right, this is indeed a pan… a frying pan. Ling Chen held the handle in front of him, it was quite funny.</p>
<p>“meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow”</p>
<p>With the frying pan in Ling Chen’s hands, the Lucky Cat at the side was anxiously calling. Ling Chen grinned and put the pan away then took a step forward…</p>
<p>And in that step, he saw the cat’s body start to shrink. The yellow fur pricked up and then “wooosh”…</p>
<p>A yellow light flashed before Ling Chen’s eyes and it suddenly disappeared without a trace. Ling Chen’s feet were dead in their tracks, everything just happened past him.</p>
<p>Right, the Lucky Cat had run away. Its running away speed let Ling Chen see its amazing escaping ability. It was just one moment but Ling Chen heard the gust of a wind and the cat had completely disappeared, not even leaving a blur. Ling Chen stood there with his mouth open and didn’t regain his senses for half a day… He was admiring the speed. What different was it from teleporting? No wonder Yi Que said that its escaping ability was unrivaled. This kind of running speed, even Gods cant do anything about it!</p>
<p>“Hee, it ran away.” His mind was filled with Yi Que’s laughter. Obviously, she didn’t doubt the Lucky Cat’s running ability. Ling Chen’s ability was no where near to being able to catch it. “but, young master’s luck was pretty good. Actually defeating a summoned strange treasure, and got a treasure from the Lucky Cat… the Lucky Cat’s body only carries items that are world treasures, young master can earn a lot from this.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen took out the Handsome Pan. Looking at the shining black bottom of the pan, he was confused. He asked: “This pan… what does it do?</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p> “……”</p>
<p>“But, since it came from the body of the Lucky Cat, it definitely wouldn’t be something simple. Looking at its description, it has something to do with cooking. Young master can take it to the cooking shops of Azure Dragon City to ask around. There might be a big return” Yi Que softly replied. After a pause, she continued: “Generally, Lucky Cat upon seeing other animals will immediately run away. It won’t stay or summon strange treasures. Just then it didn’t immediately run away and also summoned a strange treasure so there must only be one reason. Its that there must be a piece of treasure here and so it was unwilling to leave. Quick go ahead and look for it, there must some incredible thing.”</p>
<p>While Yi Que said that, Xiao Hui’s forehead point continuously flashed. Its paws touched Ling Chen’s trousers, then it ran ahead. It ran to the place where the cat had dug a hole. The light on the point had reached its brightest.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>From the actions of the Lucky Cat before, even a fool could see that it was trying to dig something up in a hurry. In fact it was about to finish, but instead it encountered Ling Chen. Even though it was dangerous, with the treasure at hand, it made it not want to leave so it spawned a strange treasure which was dealt with by Ling Chen in two hits. Thus the pan was basically just given to Ling Chen. Looking at the situation, the treasure it was a digging for before was still there as it didn’t take it away.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn’t timid, the Lucky Cat, with a body full of treasure did not run in the face of danger. What could it be?</p>
<p>Ling Chen quickly walked to the place where the Lucky Cat was. Soon, he was standing next to Xiao Hui. In the crack between the two rocks, there was an obviously newly dug up hole. Ling Chen peered into the hole. He saw something that shone with a reddish yellowish light.</p>
<p>Ling Chen crouched down and used his hand to brush away the layer of soft soil. After gently pushing it away, it was translucent. He revealed it from the Earth and picked up the red and yellow shining treasure in his hands.</p>
<p>Just then, the Lucky Cat only needed to dig a little bit more, then it could have been able to reach this precious rock.</p>
<p>“Mysterious Red Sun gold!!” Yi Que’s shout of surprise echoed in Ling Chen’s mind. The sound was filled with awe and incredulity.</p>
<p>[Mysterious Red Sun Gold]: A special metal that contains a very high density of power. Legends say that it was a stone given by God. Even with a very small piece, if all the power is drawn out of it, it will cause catastrophic destruction. There are only a few Mysterious Red Sun Golds in existence. They can be used as the main core of a pure offensive weapon or auxiliary core.</p>
<p>“What is the Mysterious Red Sun Gold?” Ling Chen asked.</p>
<p>“No wonder the fat cat was unwilling to leave… Its because there was a Mysterious Red Sun Gold hidden here. And here I was, thinking that 10,000 years ago, the Mysterious Red Sun Gold had completely been depleted on the Forgotten Continent.” Yi Que didn’t answer Ling Chen’s question directly. She slowly described with detail: “Mysterious Red Sun Gold is a type of metal that contains extreme power. Legends say, it was formed by the golden sun burning the body of God. Its an item coveted by Gods and demons alike. On the Forgotten Continent, there was a race born to forge and create. They were the “dwarfs”. The dwarfs hated crime and war. Forging was their life and soul. They have the world’s strongest forge so as a result, high level forging materials is what they desire the most. To get these high level forging materials, the dwarfs were willing to exchange anything. And Mysterious Red Sun Gold was sacred to the eyes of these dwarfs because with Mysterious Red Sun Gold, they were able to create a Heavens End… no…even Myserious God level weapons!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “!!!!” (Heavens End… Mysterious God!?)</p>
<p>“This rock can really make Heaven Grade or Mysterious God weapons?” Ling Chen asked in disbelief. Heaven End, they are players’ ultimate dream weapons. If you obtained even just one Heaven End equip, even if your other equips are standard, you’ll be able to horizontally walk through the playerbase. [TLN: I think this just means that you can easily beat anyone in the playerbase/walk right through them] Heaven End equips breaks balancing with its existence. They are only available in the later stages of the game so only the top players have the potential to be eligible for one. While Mysterious God equips… these are for players to be hopeful but never to obtain. Mysterious God equips are a rarity in all of the Forgotten Continent. They are considered mere legends to the players so nobody expects to come into contact with one. As for the Saint Destroyers equips… those are just legends within legends.</p>
<p>If all the players were told right now that here was a metal that could make Heaven End and even Mysterious God weapons, the world’s players might go crazy.</p>
<p>Hehehe, Heaven End and Mysterious God equips forging is not that easy. Heaven End equips and Mysterious God equips have very demanding material requirements. The strain on the power core is extreme. To be qualified for Heaven End or Mysterious God’s power core or auxiliary core, you cant find many of them on the entire Forgotten Continent. Mysterious Red Sun Gold is something even Gods want. With the size of this Mysterious Red Sun Gold and its dense power, it is fully qualified to be a Heaven End or lower artifact’s power core. If you find the sufficient construction materials and can control their advanced blacksmithing, there’s a real possibility of producing a Heaven End equip, or a lower grade Mysterious God equip. I’m not lying. For normal things, the Lucky Cat wouldn’t waste its time on it… Young master, this time you got a really great deal.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s heart was racing. Heaven End equip. It exceeds even the Celestial equips existence. The two in his hands were celestial equips. They had strong attributes, but in the presence of a real Heaven End equip, their properties are dull in comparison. And with Mysterious God equip… they are of the same class of the Gemini Orb and the Sagittarius Orb combined. The Gemini Orb and the Sagittarius Orb has great strength then one can only imagine how powerful Mysterious God equips are.</p>
<p>“With this piece of Mysterious Red Sun Gold and after finding the other high grade materials, can I give it to a foundry shop and let them create a Heaven End or Mysterious God equip?” Ling Chen asked with a whisper. If the two Celestial equips in his hands were changed with Heaven End equips, he didn’t know the extent of increase in strength.</p>
<p>Yi Que laughed, her voice sounding slow and lazy: “That is impossible. Because humans are incapable of producing Mysterious God level goods. With human ability and forging capabilities, forging a Heaven End equip is already the best they can do. While people who actually have the ability to forge Heaven End equips are rare, they may not necessarily exist on the Forgotten Continent yet… and even if they did, the success rate is very very low, and once the forging fails, all the materials will be consumed.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen: “…”</p>
<p>“On the Forgotten Continent, most of the Mysterious God equips don’t come by forging, but rather by Gods, Demons or the Strongest Spirits Beast using their own great strength. They can use various ways to make them but the process is extremely long and difficult and they are a very small part of the equips that naturally transforms over countless years. The rest are all from the hand of Dwarfs. Dwarfs are the only race that can forge Mysterious God class equips.</p>
<p>“Dwarfs…”</p>
<p>“But, because its like this, at one time, almost everyone wanted to enslave the Dwarfs to make them build the most advanced equipment for their race. In the fight for the Dwarfs, they were brutally murdered, until they completely disappeared on the Forgotten Continent. It could be that the last of the Dwarfs are completely hidden, never exposed to the sun or moon, but its also possible that they were completely annihilated. Who knows.”</p>
<p>Yi Que has existed for tens of thousands of years thus she knows lots of things that are not known to the residents of Forgotten Continent. Ling Chen fully understood Yi Que’s sad words. Even if he has this piece of Mysterious Red Sun Gold, unless he could find an advanced blacksmith that could forge Heaven End equips on Forgotten Continent, it would just be for displaying. And even if he found one, he still had to deal with a high failure rate unless he can find a dwarf that may or may not exist from the legends.</p>
<p>Now it seems too much to think about. Because…</p>
<p>Touching the Mysterious Red Sun Gold, it felt like it was burning hot.</p>
<p>Ling Chen touched it a few more times, but didn’t pick it up, because…</p>
<p>he didn’t learn the art of mining!</p>
<p>The higher level the ore, the higher level mining is required to access it. Ling Chen is a professional fighting-focused player. He did not take a single moment to practicing mining… Not even talking about practice, he didn’t even learn mining in school. Taking 100 steps back, even if he learnt it with the lowest mining level, it would be impossible to obtain the sacred ore that is the Mysterious Red Sun Gold of the Dwarfs that Yi Que talked about.</p>
<p>“Young mater, cant you take it out? Although the surface of the Mysterious Red Sun Gold is hot, it wont really hurt you. Young master doesn’t need to worry.” seeing how Ling Chen kept feeling around it and how he just couldn’t get it out, Yi Que said.</p>
<p>“I didnt study mining.” Ling Chen sheepishly said.</p>
<p>Yi Que: “…”</p>
<p>Ling Chen hands were continuously digging but the soft soil next to it returned onto it, covering the Mysterious Red Sun Gold’s light. He then stood up and helplessly said: “I can only ask for a high level mining NPC to come get it… Say, if i just left it here, after we leave will the Lucky Cat come back here and take it away?”</p>
<p>Yi Que voice rang out: “The timidness is that fat cat’s biggest weakness, so where its found, even if there’s a treasure, it wont go back there for a few years.”</p>
<p>“Thats good then. ”</p>
<p>For now that’s it then. This place is close to the Ghastly Grounds. There are no animals and basically no one nearby Even if someone came here, they won’t just start searching in the rocks and so, this piece of Mysterious Red Sun gold will probably still be here for countless years, going unnoticed. Overall, as long as the Lucky Cat doesn’t come back, the Mysterious Red Sun Gold should be safe. With the possibility to produce Heaven End and even Mysterious God equips with this metal, no matter who sees it, it would be an irresistible temptation. Ling Chen was no exception. After finishing today’s scouting, the first thing he would do is to find a way to get to this piece of Mysterious Red Sun Gold.</p>
<p>“yawn…”</p>
<p>His brain filled with the sound of Yi Que’s breath. It seemed to be a yawn. then, with her soft and lazy voice: “I have been awake only for a little but now I’m sleepy again. Young master, I need to go sleep now, otherwise even the spirit body will be damaged. The undead gas is thick here. The air is filled with the smell of death. Young master needs to be careful… Oh yeah, I need to tell young master one last thing. If you want to catch the Lucky Cat, possess its body before it realizes…but, the Lucky Cat is a spirit of Heaven and Earth, so effects such as dizziness, freeze, petrify and sleep [TLN: basically CC statuses] that limit action will be completely ineffective. Even the Extreme Water Dragon couldn’t freeze it. As long as it finds out [TLN: Meaning the cat senses the person nearby], nobody can stop its escape. So young master, you are the world’s most likely person to catch the Lucky Cat.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Ling Chen was startled, then suddenly understanding: “You mean… Lunar Scourge?”</p>
<p>“Young master is smart. Lunar Scourge’s suppress ability is one that no creature under the Heaven can resist. Even the Lucky Cat cant. But, young master right now even with the suppress ability still cant catch it, because the Lucky Cat will never allow anything within 50 metres of it. Young master’s largest suppress range is only 13 metres. The range of suppression will increase with the young master’s level and will improve accordingly. When young master is level 50 and above and sees the Lucky Cat again, then it really will be possible to catch it.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Lunar Scourge’s range is directly proportional to Ling Chen’s level. Like Yi Que said, if Ling Chen’s level is greater than 50, then Lunar Scourge’s range will be bigger than 50m. When that happens, Ling Chen can suppress the Lucky Cat from outside its 50m detection distance. Then, if at that time, his movement speed is good enough to close 50 metres in less than 5 seconds, then catching the Lucky Cat is a real possibility.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s heart beat with excitement. Catching the Lucky Cat, he would then be able to get at least one of its treasures. Catching the Lucky Cat that has never been caught before would give a great sense of achievement. On the other hand, Yi Que also said the Lucky Cat won’t go to places where there are many people and that most people won’t even see it once. So, its not to say whether I could successfully catch it, its whether I’ll see it again is the question.</p>
<p>“How can I find the Lucky Cat?” Ling Chen asked after a moment of thought.</p>
<p>“You can’t find the Lucky Cat. If you want to bump into it, you’ll just need to be lucky, which is to say, the luckier a person is the more likely that person will see it. Young master being able to see it today is testament to the fact that young master’s luck is quite good. Well, I cant take it anymore. I’ll go sleep now. Its pretty scary out here so be careful.”</p>
<p>Then, Yi Que didn’t make any more sounds. Her current state makes it so that she can only stay awake for a very short time per day and materialize for only 10 minutes at a time.</p>
<p>The higher the luck the higher chance encounter it? Ling Chen looked at his luck stat — 9 points. If Xiao Hui’s level increased 3 more times, then his own luck stat will increase to 10 points, reaching the limit of an average player. If Xiao Hui reaches level 40, then his own luck stat will increase to 15. Its a pretty scary amount of luck. [TLN: He means it in a good way I believe]</p>
<p>After covering where the Mysterious Red Sun Gold was hidden, Ling Chen summoned the Cloud Stepping Mare and went eastbound.</p>
<p>After half an hour…</p>
<p>“Ding… You’ve entered the Ghastly Grounds.”</p>
<p>Its clearly daytime but here it seemed like it was early evening. The air was filled with thick grey gas which greatly reduced visibility. A wave of cold air blew by. The wind had a rancid taste. Sometimes there would be ghostly sounds that would cause a person’s hair to stand up.</p>
<p>This was indeed the Ghastly Grounds. If someone whom had less courage stepped in here, they might not even have the guts to take a step forward, Ling Chen silently thought. Getting down from the Cloud Stepping Mare he called it back, took out his two weapons and started walking towards the gloomy world shrouded in fog, keeping on high alert.</p>
<p>“ahwooo…”</p>
<p>“yiii yiii yii” (bat sounds i think)</p>
<p>“hee hahahahahahaha”</p>
<p>All types of sounds that could chill a a person from outside in were coming from all sides. It could make even a man of courage’s teeth chatter. The more forward he went, the more the rancid tasting gray smoke thickened, affecting visibility more and more. Ling Chen’s eyebrows had a bit of sweat. Even for him, being alone in this kind of environment would make him feel a little scared.</p>
<p> -100，-100，-100……</p>
<p>Above Ling Chen’s head, one after another, bright red numbers were floating up. One appeared every second, making Ling Chen’s HP decrease rapidly. After he noticed this, he quickly took out a bowl of rice porridge that he bought from Peace Town. He drank it all with a “gulping” sound. Suddenly, the coldness in his body and the light dizziness in his brain felt a lot better.</p>
<p>“Ding… you used ‘rice porridge’, HP regen + 10. Influence of Death’s Breath will be weakened for 10 minutes.”</p>
<p>-10，-10，-10……</p>
<p>It turns out that even though the rice porridge’s taste was alright the effect is by no means weak. The impact of Death’s Breath was suddenly reduced to 10%. The strength of the porridge surprised Ling Chen. He looked at Xiao Hui following behind him. Within the undead gas it was walking with swagger. The spirit in that state was no different from normal. There weren’t any numbers signifying loss of life above its head… It was completely unaffected!</p>
<p>Xiao Hui you freak! Ling Chen said softl. Continuing moving forwards, he stopped moving after a few metres.</p>
<p>Among the darkness ahead, slow moving shadows appeared one after another.</p>
<p>[Zombie]: Category: Undead, level: 15, HP: 638. The bodies of the dead which are under the influence of Death’s Breath have turned into the undead. They now hate all things living. It will use its two hands to tear up any form of life.</p>
<p>Talents: High attack and defence. Move speed extremely low. 70% dark attack resistance.</p>
<p>Attacking Techniques: Rigidly swinging its arm to hit the target. Once hit, it will deal a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Amidst the black fog, a slow moving shadow followed the smell of life, heading towards Ling Chen’s direction. Their bodies were dark green and black. They wore tattered clothes and most of the body had already decayed. Some even had eyes that were hanging out. Their movements were extremely slow, only taking a step every two seconds.</p>
<p>In this eerie environment along with the scary shapes of the zombies, if players found this place, he didn’t know how many would have the guts to come in. Ling Chen’s eyebrows twitched. He then rushed up. While he was almost there he used “Ling Tian Slash” in both hands, one from the left side and one from the right side.</p>
<p>pangpangpangpang…</p>
<p>-642，-647，-784，-1292……</p>
<p>The blast released from Soaring Cloud and the Zephyr blade hit the zombie’s body. The sound it made was a dull sound, like hitting a rock.</p>
<p>These zombie’s bodies were very hard and although Ling Chen’s Ling Tian Slash didn’t crit it can still nicely kill them. A scream that sounded like it came from hell rang out repeatedly. Then all zombies within 5 metres of him collapsed. From each fallen zombie, a copper coin was dropped.</p>
<p>Xiao Hui immediately start moving in. The 5 copper coins that were picked up all directly appeared in Ling Chen’s backpack. Then, it stood next to the corpses… After standing still for 2 seconds and taking two steps back, it walked sadly back to Ling Chen’s side. The condition of these zombies left Xiao Hui with no desire to eat them.</p>
<p>-15，-15，-15……</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s HP loss rate increased by a little as he traveled deeper. Ling Chen looked above his head and started to run faste. After moving another few hundred metres, the gray fog caused the visibility to drop down to only a 10 metres radius. In addition, Ling Chen’s HP lost increased to 30 per second…</p>
<p>Every time he downed a big bowl of rice porridge, Ling Chen took a deep breath. In front of him appeared a smokey figure that was completely green…</p>
<p>[Poison Zombie]: category: undead, level: 15, grade: one star elite, HP: 1500, Because the body had become too rotten, the body mutated into a poisonous zombie. It is disgusted with life and will use its own hands to tear up any form of life.</p>
<p>Talents: High attack and defence, very slow movespeed. 70% resistance to dark attacks. Any attack has a 30% chance to apply 10 seconds of ‘poison’ status. It deals 30 HP per second when poisoned and upon touching the body of the Poison Zombie it has a 100% chance of being poisoned.</p>
<p>Attack techniques: Rigidly swinging its arm to hit the target, once hit it will deal a lot of damage.</p>
<p>The looks of the Poison Zombie made Ling Chen feel uncomfortable. The only difference between them and the ordinary zombies is that their bodies were highly toxic, so their combat ability has greatly increased. But, what Ling Chen noticed was that 19 shadowy figures appeared before him and they were all poison zombies, which is to say, they’re all 1 star elites!!</p>
<p>A whole group of one star elites has appeared!</p>
<p>Under this pressure he felt nauseous. Ling Chen took the initiative. Although the bodies of these zombies carry poison, their movement speed is exactly the same as the ordinary zombies. There is no danger being posed to Ling Chen. He rushed up, sweeping them with Ling Tian Slash. Stacking 2 Ling Tian Slashes will be able to hit the surrounding Poison Zombies, drawing blood. If they crit then it will one shot them. With the second round of Ling Tian Slash, all the poison zombies within range will be defeated.</p>
<p>“ding… you have successfully killed a one star elite ‘Poison Zombie’, prestige +15, Skill points +15.”</p>
<p>“ding… you have successfully killed a one star elite ‘Poison Zombie’…</p>
<p>“ding… you have successfully killed a one star elite ‘Poison Zombie’…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Every killed Poison Zombie granted 15 prestige points and 15 skill points. Ling Chen’s speed was unrivaled. If a group of one star elites appeared, it would be enough to make any player be surprised out of control. Seeing the Poison Zombies collapse, Ling Chen suddenly thought that if Poison Zombies appear here like normal monsters, after dying will they respawn like normal monsters…</p>
<p>Wouldn’t that mean there is unlimited prestige points and skill points!?</p>
<p>The idea was wonderful, but obviously, this kind of situation wouldn’t happen. When the 30th Poison Zombie fell, other than the surrounding chilly winds, he couldn’t find any of the Poison Zombie’s shadowy figure. Ling Chen stood on the spot, waiting for 5 minutes and no new Poison Zombies respawned. And on the ground, the fallen Poison Zombies’ still hadn’t disappeared after 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s guess was right. The creatures killed on the Ghastly Grounds wont disappear because they are already dead. In this deathly environment, after a set time, the fallen bodies will just get up again.</p>
<p>Ling Chen didn’t stick around and continued walking ahead. After killing 30 Poison Zombies, he gained 450 prestige points and 450 skill points. It was a pretty big yield so he was completely satisfied.</p>
<p>At this time, he had been travelling in the Ghastly Grounds for half an hour, already passing the middle point of the Ghastly Grounds. According to the people of Peace Town, all who entered the Silent Soul Ridge near the dark depths of the Ghastly Grounds have never returned… Right now, the place where everyone had been talking about drew increasingly close.</p>
<p>-50，-50，-50……</p>
<p>Within Death’s Breath, Ling Chen’s HP loss became faster and faster. His steps were getting slower and slower, his attention was also tight with tension.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>According to the information gathered from Peace Town, the Ghastly Grounds are around 10km long. In the depths of the Ghastly Grounds, is the entrance to the Silent Soul Ridge. As he was travelling he was calculating the distance at the same time. In that moment, he had already travelled 9km of distance. With a few hundred metres more, he will be at the Silent Soul Ridge… the place where no one has ever returned.</p>
<p>-50，-50，-50……</p>
<p>He was losing life at 50HP per second. With the rate of HP loss, the whole way, Ling Chen had ran out of yellow potions and the 600 green potions that he started with was now down to 200. He was only prepared to scout the area. He totally didn’t expect to quickly use up so many potions. With the current rate of consumption, the most he could stay was for another 20 minutes before needing to ride out of there on his mare at full speed, otherwise he’ll die due to running out of potions…. Because the Ghastly Grounds is a special map, one can’t use return scrolls.</p>
<p>Continuing to walk for 500m, in the far away distance in his line of sight is a black silhouetted figure on the mountain. Looking ahead, it looked like the devil’s castle on the mountain top. The eeriness would cause people to not even dare to look at it more than once.</p>
<p>Is that the Silent Soul Ridge?</p>
<p>In the Ghastly Ground’s low visibility, he could only make out a vague outline, which meant that the distance from here to the Silent Soul Ridge is now less than 100m! The distance to which all who enter will die, is only a stone’s throw away.</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s footsteps grew slower, almost checking his surroundings for each step that he took. Then, Xiao Hui that was behind him suddenly stopped moving. It made a warning sound. Ling Chen’s eyebrows raised and he immediately stopped stepping forwards.His left and right hands were holding the Soaring Cloud and the Zephyr blade respectively.</p>
<p>“chirpchirpchirp… heheheheehe”</p>
<p>“Hehahahahahaha”</p>
<p>The echoing laughter came with the wind. From the black fog in front of him, a walking shadow slowly emerged. It was a black coat floating in the air. Under the cover of the cloak he could see the body below. Under the black hood, he could see a skull grinning.</p>

<p>ta…ta…ta..ta..ta..</p>
<p>The undead summoner let out a creepy laugh. In the black fog in front of him, there was the sound of heavy footsteps, which will soon showed their bodies… Its whole body was green. It was a combination of human and animal. It was a giant troll and in its hands, were two bloody machetes.</p>
<p>[Dual Wielding Troll]: Category: Undead, level: 15, class: boss. HP: 16800, The underworld’s lowest level guard. It has a cruel temperament and is bloodthirsty. Chopping the bodies of the living gave it the greatest joy.</p>

<p>“heheheehhahahahahaha… chirpchirpchirp”</p>
<p>In the rear, another gloomy array of voices rang out. Ling Chen’s head turned to the side. Another one of the same cloak figure was floating behind the undead summoner. Under the cloak was an equally scary ferocious skull… The only difference was that under the cloak had a stretched out skeleton arm, holding a long jade staff.</p>

<p>In front was the Undead Summoner and the Dual Wielding Troll. Behind them was the Undead Destoryer…</p>
<p>3 level 15 Lord of Souls boss!</p>
<p>“Lets…go…” Ling Chen didn’t run. His eyes narrowed. He slowly raised both hands. Then he suddenly turned his body, he rushed towards the rear… the boss that poses the biggest threat is the Undead Destroyer!</p>
<p>Upon meeting it, Ling Chen suddenly attacked. The Undead Destroyer in a flash had teleported 5 metres away where Ling Chen couldnt reach it. Its whole body was dark. It laughed with a “chatter”, then sent its dark sickle, creating a thick atmosphere of death. Ling Chen rolled aside, calmly avoiding it. Behind him came the Dual Wielding Troll’s footsteps. Ling Chen didn’t look back. After avoiding another swing of the dark sickle, in that moment, his right hand pointed the Soaring Cloud at the Undead Destroyer…</p>
<p>-2251！</p>
<p>Soaring Cloud hit the Undead Destroyer in midair. The magic type boss gave it strong attacks and an large attack range but it also had extremely low HP and defense. As they were similar level 15 lord bosses, the Undead Destroyer and Undead Summoner’s HP is only half of the Dual Wielding Troll. The Soaring Cloud directly hit the Undead Destroyer, taking a ¼ of its HP whilst also mercilessly shooting it down from the sky. Ling Chen ignored the falling Undead Destroyer and the Dual Wielding Troll behind him. He rushed ahead with all his strength, quickly rushing towards Soaring Cloud, grabbing it and turned his body, facing the the Dual Wielding Troll as it was swinging his machetes aggressively.</p>
<p>Even though the Dual Wielding Troll’s body was big, his movement was still pretty fast. Ling Chen calculated the time it was taking to get close. It must have between 140 to 150 movespeed. It was better than his by a dozen points!</p>
<p>Bang!!</p>
<p>The two machetes hits the ground, making a deafening sound. It kicked up dust within metres of the impact. The ground was left with 2 lines that were long and deep. If the 2 strikes hit, given Ling Chen’s vitality it would not kill him, but it would at least draw blood. But, with strong attack power and good move speed, the troll’s shortcomings are immediately apparent. Each time it attacked there was a long wait period… Ling Chen jumped away when he was attacked once again by the Undead Destroyer. It took about 2 seconds to raise the two blades before it started to chase him again.</p>
<p>“awhhooo~~”</p>
<p>In the darkness, there were 6 flashing red lights, rushing towards him. They were summoned by the Undead Summoner. They were 2 star elite undead demon wolves. Behind the undead wolves, were three hands holding a sword each. They were armour warriors. 2 star elite undead soldiers!</p>
<p>Unless you could the Undead Summoner itself, these six summoned 2 star elites could not be killed!</p>
<p>“humph!”</p>
<p>A sound of disdain escaped from Ling Chen’s mouth. In the face of the three undead wolves and three undead warriors, he still rushed up all the same. When he neared them, two wolves suddenly pounced towards him trying to bite. Ling Chen’s eyes flashed and instantly determined the trajectory of the wolves. Without reducing his speed, he moved his body slightly left, letting one of the wolves bite him. After pausing for a bit, he suddenly accelerated and within seconds he moved his body three times, leaving all the wolves behind. Looking ahead he used both hands to cast the “Ling Tian Slash” on the undead warriors ahead.</p>
<p>pa!pa!</p>
<p>Two loud noises were head as two undead warriors were knocked back 3 body lengths. The third undead warrior came to attack him. The recovery speed of Ling Chen was unthinkable for someone who just attacked. After the attack, his hands were quickly controlled to move the body. He escaped the attacker and rushed forwards, with the undead warriors following behind. He then looked over to the Undead Destroyer in the air. A dark round sickle flew towards him. He didn’t think, he just jumped. In the air there was a sound of tearing. The dark sickle fell at his feet as he was jumping. Ling Chen who was in the air put his hands together, overlapping his hands to use a “Ling Tian Slash” directed at the Undead Destroyer.</p>
<p>-812，-1620！</p>
<p>The Undead Destroyer can only be at a maximum of 5m in the air. That was absolutely not a height that Ling Chen couldn’t reach. Not just his Soaring Cloud, but also his Ling Tian Slash, they could both reach a 5 metre distance!</p>
<p>The Undead Destroyer in the air once attacked and immediately floated back down. When the Undead Destroyer was floating down behind Ling Chen, the three undead demon wolves nearby and the soldiers turned to face him. With the strong Dual Wielding Troll only a few metres away from him with such a strong attack, Ling Chen silently glanced before him and raised his right hand…</p>
<p>“Lunar Scourge!!”</p>
<p>In thes Ghastly Grounds, Lunar Scourge’s light was extra bright. Lunar Scourge’s light had a range of 13m, which included all the summoned undead. The Undead Destroyer and the Dual Wielding Troll was frozen there. As for the Undead Summoner… all it could do was summon undeads. It itself didn’t have any attacking capabilities, so Ling Chen ignored it. Moving his hands together, he performed round after round of “Ling Tian Slash” towards the motionless body of the Undead Destroyer.</p>
<p>-1546，-1552。</p>
<p>-1522，-3046。</p>
<p>It was only the second round but the Undead Destroyer’s HP was gone but because it was completely frozen, its state cannot be changed, so its body was still floating in the air. Ling Chen quickly turned around, targeting the Dual Wielding Troll, saying aloud: “Next!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Undead Summoner was the only one that didn’t get caught by Moon Shadow. The summoner types have extremely weak defence and they also have no attacking ability. The Undead Summoner’s body gleamed in the distance, continually releasing black particles, but the undead wolves and undead warriors weren’t listening to its commands. They were all motionless. All summoner types have a summoning limit. With these 3 undead wolves and 3 undead warriors around, the Undead Summoner is unable to summon anymore. It can only just sit there a desperately and use its mana, unable to do anything.</p>
<p>Every second in Moon Shadow was precious. After killing the Undead Destroyer Ling Chen quickly rushed towards the Dual Wielding Troll, rapidly casting “Ling Tian Slash”…</p>
<p>2960，-1482。</p>
<p>1483，-1446。</p>
<p>Two rounds of attacks dealt a little more than a third of the Dual Wielding Troll’s HP. At this time, Moon Shadow’s effect ended and the Dual Wielding Troll and the 6 undead have all fully recovered, instantly starting to close in on Ling Chen. The dead body of the Undead Destroyer was finally falling out of the sky. Its body dropped something that glowed with a black light, falling before Ling Chen. The Dual Wielding Troll raised its machetes, and with a low growl swung aggressively at his head.</p>
<p>The 6 undeads were blocking Ling Chen’s back. If he took a step back, the undead warrior’s attack would directly fall upon him. He glanced at the Dual Wielding Troll’s HP. His expression clouded. He was just standing there unmoving, while the two machetes were quickly descending towards his head.</p>
<p>“Battle Soul Possession!”</p>
<p>“Ling Tian Slash”, “ Four Corners Star Formation!!”</p>
<p>bang…boom!!</p>
<p>In the soul possessed state, facing the Dual Wielding Troll, Ling Chen used Ling Tian Slash with his left hand and used Four Corners Star Formation with his right hand at the same time. When his two weapons came into contact with the Dual wielding troll, the Dual Wielding Troll’s machetes had also deeply cut into Ling Chen.</p>
<p>320，-318！</p>
<p>2944，-11300！</p>
<p>Ling Chen’s HP almost dropped to zero. At the same time, the force of the impact also pushed him back a number of steps. He almost fell onto the ground. He wasn’t quick enough to adjust his body. He spent the next few seconds drinking green potions before he died. With his HP restored, in front of him, above the troll’s head rose two huge damage numbers. The Four Corners Star Formation had crit! The damage that came from the “soul possession” state was more than 10,000!</p>
<p>The Dual Wielding Troll fell. The 6 undead that were originally close by were pushed away by the strength of Four Corners Star Formation.</p>
<p>“Ding… you have successfully killed a level15 boss ”Undead Destroyer”, prestige +150, skill points +150.”</p>
<p>“Ding.. you have successfully killed a level 15 boss “Dual Wielding Troll”, prestige +150, skill points +150.”</p>
<p>The item that came out of the Dual Wielding Troll was immediately picked up by Xiao Hui. Ling Chen didn’t have time to see what it was. Taking advantage of the 6 undead that were still on the ground, he quickly rushed to the final goal — the Undead Summoner.</p>
<p>The summoner class was no doubt powerful, even among players. A powerful summoner can summon beasts which can stop armies alone but with the condition that he is able to protect himself. Because the life of the summoner is far more fragile than an elementalist, once enemies got close by and without any way to protect yourself, being able to summon more will do you no good. You could not do anything but wait for death. To the Undead Summoner, its self-preservation techniques are the low altitude floating and the short distance teleports but Ling Chen’s range on “Ling Tian Burst” is 5m so he’ll be able to reach it. Its ability of self-preservation had already been directly undermined by half. Ordinary groups of warriors are only able to attack on the horizontal axis. Being unable to attack vertically, they are unable to do anything in the face of an enemy in the air. But Ling Chen’s “Ling Tian Burst” is capable of facing any direction, it is completely different.</p>
<p>The 6 undead that were knocked onto the ground had got up. Ling Chen had already rushed to below the Undead Summoner. He then jumped and growled: “You get down here!”</p>
<p>Using the “Ling Tian Burst”, he aimed directly at the Undead Summoner. The Undead Summoner responded quickly. using its “Undead floating” to move down 3m, making Ling Chen’s attack fail, but the instant that the it rematerialized, Ling Chen had poised his left hand to cast “Ling Tian Burst”</p>
<p>bang!!</p>
<p>810！</p>
<p>The fragile Undead Summoner was directly hit in the midair, falling onto the ground. Ling Chen rushed up in two steps, quickly using Ling Tian Slash.</p>
<p>3050，-1532。</p>
<p>1528，-1519。</p>
<p>Although the Undead Summoner was a level 15 boss, it only had 7800HP, less than half of the Dual Wielding Troll’s HP. Ling Chen’s first round of Ling Tian Slash had done significant damage and then the second round had completely drained its HP. With the sound of its ghostlike cries, the Undead Summoner slowly fell to the ground. Behind Ling Chen, the 6 close by undead bodies, suddenly became wooden carvings, then they all collapsed.</p>
<p>“Ding.. you have successfully killed a level 15 boss “Undead Summoner”, prestige +150, skill point +150.”</p>
<p>Ling Chen let out a sigh. Then, in the silence, the gloomy chilly winds no longer had any floating figures. They were only on the ground. There were bodies one after another.</p>
<p>Three level 15 bosses were all lying at Ling Chen’s feet. It didn’t even take too much effort and in the whole process he was only hit once by the Dual Wielding Troll.</p>
<p>When he killed these powerful undead, their loot was picked by Xiao Hui. Ling Chen opened his back, quickly going through his inventory. The three level 15 bosses dropped 3 pieces of equipment… one of which were gold earrings!</p>
<p>[Cursed Earrings]: Category: Earring, Grade: Gold, Equipment requirements: Level 15 or above magicians. Dark earrings that have been imbued with Death’s Breath. It contains powerful magic, but will gradually consume the wearer’s HP. Attributes: Magic Attack +25, Spirit +10, HP regen per second -10.</p>
<p>The Cursed Earring’s attributes were no doubt strong. A strong magician could use it and greatly increase their attack power but with a strong effect, it also carries a strong side effect, it devours HP per second. At the cost of 10HP per second an already fragile Elementalist, Priest or Summoner would be even more prone to death.</p>
<p>The other two pieces of equipment: one was painted black, a breastplate with a tattoo of a hideous skill and the other were a pair of gloves printed with skeleton bones.</p>
<p>[Dark Chest Plate]: Category: Upper Garment, Grade: Gold, Equipment requirement: level 15 and above warrior. A black breastplate surrounded by Death’s Breath. It has a strong ability to resist dark attacks. Attributes: Defence +45, strength +7, constitution+6, dark resistance +5%, immune to cursed state.</p>
<p>[Skeleton Gloves]: Category: Gauntlets, Grade: gold, Equipment requirements: level 15 and above any profession. Dark gloves that have an outline of a skeleton on it. It releases an aura of fear. Attributes: Defence +17, attack +10, hit rate +5, crit rate +3%, dark resistance +3%.</p>
<p>The three equips that the 3 bosses dropped were all gold. This was a surprisingly large return. Moreover all but the earrings, could be equipped by him. Immediately, he removed his Golden Stitched Garments and his White Silver Bracers, putting on the Dark Chestplate and the Skeleton Gloves.</p>
<p>The three bosses not only dropped 3 equips but there was also a black crystalline item and a scroll that let out a pale white glow.</p>
<p>[Undead Stone]: Category: Energy Crystal, Grade: Low. Attribute: Dark. Effect: Mounting it will provide 1 hour of immunity to Death’s Breath effects. Immune to curse, immune dark, death state, will be lost immediately after the duration is over.</p>
<p>[Skill scroll — Trinity Blood] : Usage requirements, level 10 or above any profession. After using it, one will acquire [Trinity Blood]. It can be used when below 30% HP. When casted, the user will start burning with rage. User’s own defence will be lowered to 0, attack will increase by 50%. Non-upgradable and cannot be used in conjunction with other attack power increases.</p>
<p>That black crystal is a lower grade energy crystal, moreover it only lasts a short period, but in this environment, it can be used very effectively. Ling Chen immediately mounted it onto Lunar Scourge. Suddenly, a weak dark flash appeared and the choking feeling in his chest suddenly disappeared without a trace. The loss of life completely stopped and even his sight improved. But that scroll, it is difficult to find a gold skill scroll, moreover it was what allowed the Dual Wielding Troll to go ballistic. Its too bad that other skills that increase attack cannot be used in conjunction with it, rendering “Soul Sacrifice” useless if he used this ability.</p>
<p>Before, Xiao Hui didn’t swallow a single zombie but the 3 undead bosses made it excited. It stood by their bodies and opened its mouth widely, releasing a grey light over them, then swallowed the 3 bosses in one gulp. While eating the 3 level 15 bosses, Xiao Hui level 12’s EXP bar increased quite a bit. After a while, he spat out crystal releasing a black light. This crystal was bigger than the Undead Stone, the dark light released was also more profound.</p>
<p>[Dark Crystal]: Category: Energy Crystal, Grade: High. Attribute: dark. Effect: Immunity to curse, dark and death state.</p>
<p>Compared to the Undead Stone which is consumed after a short period, the dark crystal provides permanent immunity which is significantly stronger, especially the immunity to death state. It meant that he would not need to fear this world’s most feared status of “death”.</p>
<p>The dark crystal was also mounted onto the Lunar Scourge and as a result, 10 of the 12 free holes in the Lunar Scourge had been used.</p>
<p>Things have quietened down with only the occasional scary wind. The Silent Soul Ridge was nearby. It was just like the Devil’s mouth, waiting for him to step into it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After mounting the Undead Stone, Ling Chen’s HP loss completely stopped in the Ghastly Grounds, but it also made him afraid. It made him focus more on the dangers of what he might discover. The blurry image in front of him told him that he was entering the Silent Soul Ridge. He was less than 100m away. Just then, even though the 3 Lords were strong, they weren’t the real danger. There are countless experts on Forgotten Continent so why wouldn’t they be able to deal with 3 level 15 lords.</p>
<p>Silent Soul Ridge, what could it be hiding?</p>
<p>Tap…</p>
<p>Ling Chen completely filled his HP and MP, then he finally started heading forwards. With every step, he was closer to the place where everything would die.</p>
<p>tap…tap…tap…tap…tap…</p>
<p>In the whole world, only the sound of Ling Chen’s footsteps and his heartbeat could be heard. In his line of sight, the image of the Silent Soul Ridge became clearer little by little. Ling Chen looked ahead, and made discovery. From this position, looking at the image of the Silent Soul Ridge, it looked like a fierce skull. Upon moving closer, it really was a skull with a dark mouth for an entry.</p>
<p>10 steps…20 steps…50steps…</p>
<p>“Ahwoooo!!”</p>
<p>Behind him, Xiao Hui let out a sound. It wasn’t loud, but in this gloomy silence it made Ling Chen jump. He suddenly stopped moving and immediately tried respond, but that didn’t seem like a warning sound from Xiao Hui. When it senses danger, the sound it makes is much sharper.</p>
<p>“Ahwoooo!”</p>
<p>Xiao Hui rubbed its gray paw against Ling Chen’s trousers, then started running left. Ling Chen was stunned for a moment then quickly ran after it. After a dozen steps, Xiao Hui stopped and faced the front, making another noise. Ling Chen looking at what Xiao Hui was facing. He could only see the gray air and the smooth dark ground which was nothing strange. However, Ling Chen had seen Xiao Hui’s strong abilities. If it stopped here, then there was definitely a reason. After pondering for a moment, he tried to step forward. Then he crouched down and tentatively reached out. He touched the ground that Xiao Hui was still facing. And in the moment that he touched it, a magical sight unfolded before his eyes… The smooth ground, with the touch of his hand, had started to “melt away”, leaving a dark hole clearly in the ground.</p>
<p>The hole was 1m long. At a glance, he could see that there was a ladder leading to the bottom.</p>
<p>“ding… You’ve found a hidden map “Dark Passages”. Prestige +50.”</p>
<p>Xiao Hui’s Holy Spirit Eye could find hidden maps. He used this power/ability to discover his first hidden map, even though it appeared in these Ghastly Grounds!</p>
<p>Hidden maps are extremely difficult to find in general as they are usually hidden in places which people don’t come across. This was an eerie place where no one dared to enter all year round. It was a place where the only things happening were the undead moving around. Its exactly this kind of place that would be a hidden map, especially because of how close it is to the Silent Soul Ridge.</p>
<p>Dark passage… passage… Is it a path to somewhere!?</p>
<p>While hidden maps are hard to find they may also have great dangers hidden within them. It was just like when Ling Chen was in the novice village and he fell into the cave. That was also a hidden map and the degree of risk was far greater than any general map in the novice towns. Ling Chen stared at the dark hole, not knowing where it led. Then he slowly walked over to it, then lifting his right foot and putting it on the first step leading down. He was getting ready to follow the steps going down to the hidden passage, not knowing where it would lead.</p>
<p>At this time, Ling Chen suddenly heard the sound of a faint step within the cave. He stopped moving and stopped breathing. He was quietly staying still. The footsteps were growing increasingly clear. It seems to be from the inside coming out!!</p>
<p>Ling Chen quickly retreated. He stood 3 metres outside the cave. He furrowed his brow. His left hand was holding the Soaring Cloud and his right hand holding the Zephyr blade with his eyes firmly fixed on the hidden entrance.</p>
<p>The footsteps got closer and closer and heavier and heavier. It gradually drew closer to his ears. Finally, a person’s silhouette came out from the inside. When Ling Chen saw him and he saw Ling Chen, they were both stunned.</p>
<p>This is a person and not an undead! Ling Chen knew from the first sight, because even though his complexion was dark and faint blue back, his eyes were bright. It seemed to have a normal temperament. It didn’t have eyes that appeared to be undead. His body was lean and… it was actually as thin as a stick. He had a long monkey-like face that was mostly bald. There were only a few strands of hair on the crown of his head. He was wearing a ragged blue suit, with a short bamboo stick. If Ling Chen saw him on the streets, he would think that he was a beggar and not a very good one at that.</p>
<p>After the stick man saw him for half a second, he suddenly began to shout: “Where did you come from you ghost? Who asked you to come here! Are you a low level undead who are the only ones eligible to enter into the Gates of Hades? hrm? Wait, how do you have the living spirit…” The monkey man finally discovered what was wrong. He quickly looked up and down Ling Chen. Suddenly his eyes stared and he gave a dramatic cry: “Holy Shit!! You’re a living person!!”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you alive too.” Ling Chen expressionlessly asked.</p>
<p>“Hey, you and I aren’t the same. I’m a living person that can open the underworld. I cant be compared to normal people… Hah! How can I have a conversation with you? What kind of person like you is doing here? Don’t you know that this is the entrance to the underworld? Wrong!! With that scary bastard around, its more like nothing living can even come here, so how did you get here? “ The stickman immediately twisted his head to look in the direction of the Silent Soul Ridge. Then after half a second, he said to himself: “This boy is not weak at all, but still, he cant oppose that bastard… Looks like that bastard wasn’t home today.”</p>
<p>“Entrance to the underworld?” Ling Chen glanced at the “Dark Passage”, and said in the low voice: “What kind of a place is the underworld?”</p>
<p>The stickman that was holding onto the short bamboo stick, impatiently said: “Obviously its the place where dead people go. Why do you ask so many questions. Ha, little one, you’re lucky that that scary bastard wasn’t home today, otherwise you would have never lived to make it to this place. Alright alright, quickly go away, I’ve got business to attend to.”</p>
<p>After speaking, he didn’t bother with Ling Chen. His body was swaying as he walked towards the west.</p>
<p>“I said, what kind of place is the underworld, tell me. And the scary bastard you were talking about, who’s that?” Ling Chen called out from behind him. He had no idea that he would find a person living here. At first he thought there was some kind of hidden boss, but turns out it was just a living person. A non-dangerous living person.</p>
<p>Qian Gun Gun:????</p>
<p>Xiao Hui’s Holy Spirit’s Eye provided information that was being sent to Ling Chen that caused his lip to twitch. Holy Spirit’s Eye can only detect things that are lower than its own level + 10. Being unable to identify the details of this stickman was not too surprising, but the key information was that name…</p>
<p>Qian Gun Gun kept walking, then he stood still for three seconds. He seemed to be considering something. Then only did he come back, saying something that puzzled Ling Chen: “Yo! Cant you see that you’re so young but you’re still a rich person. I Qian Gun Gun almost missed it. Hai, there nothing that happens on this earth that I Qian Gun Gun don’t know about. I would be the right person to ask these questions, but, I Qian Gun Gun didn’t make money by making a loss. If you want me to answer, you’re going to have to come up with enough money. Want to know what kind of place the underworld is? I’ll only charge you 10,000 gold coins for this. I, Qian Gun Gun have always made deals fairly, so money first!</p>
<p>One question costs 10,000 gold!? Thats a robbery!!</p>
<p>“Young master, give him the money now!! Give him as much as possible to stall him!! If you can make him willing to trade with you, it would be a great thing!!”</p>
<p>Ling Chen was about to swear at the stickman when the voice of Qi Yue, who had to go bed rang out in his mind. Ling Chen noted, and quickly responded: “Who is he?”</p>
<p>Qi Yue carefully explained: “Underworld businessman, Qian Gun Gun. He is a human that can freely travel between the underworld and the real world. Don’t think that his appearance is ugly, but he has existed for 10,000 years already. He is addicted to money and good at collecting all kinds of strange and eccentric things then selling them to the rich. What he sells, even though they are expensive, they are mostly things that are hard to come by. At the same time, hes been around on the Forgotten Continent and the underworld for countless years. He knows things that other people don’t know, but if you want to know something from him, it would also be a substantial cost. His fame was known throughout 10,000 years ago. Countless people were eager to meet him and then heavily spend gold on buying what he has or finding out what information he knows. However, he and the Lucky Cat are equally as elusive. Most people wont meet him. For young master to be able to meet him, it is already extremely lucky!”</p>
<p>Underworld businessman… Qian Gun Gun?</p>
<p>Someone so important to Qi Yue was looking at him. He just looks like an unremarkable beggar. His heart immediately had a measurement… but the question is…</p>
<p>“I don’t have that much gold. Can it be cheaper?” Ling Chen said helplessly. One question for 10,000 gold… This was daylight robbery, what player can afford this!</p>
<p>Stickman jumped: “Holy Shit!! You can’t fool me. You dare lie to I, Qian Gun Gun old man! With a sniff, I can more or less know how much money you’re carrying on you! If you aren’t carrying 10,000, I’ll walk backwards from now on!”</p>
<p>“But I really don’t have that much gold.” Ling Chen curled his lip. Before leaving Azure Dragon City, he basically had to spend all his gold. After thinking of Qi Yue’s words, he felt as though he couldn’t offend this incredible person. So he brought up his backpack, preparing to show how much gold he had to show that he wasn’t lying… He casually glanced at the digital value of his own money. He was stunned.</p>
<p>Gold: 427583gold coins!</p>
<p>Ling Chen was dumbfounded. On his body, he was carrying over 400,000 gold coins! An astronomical amount at this stage!!</p>
<p>Whats this? Where did this gold come from? When did I get this much gold!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Seeing more than 400,000 gold, Ling Chen was stunned for 3 seconds… Where did all this gold come from? Did it fall from the sky? Was there a problem with the system? Or did he accidentally trigger a hidden event that gave out rewards? After buying a variety of potions from Azure Dragon city, he only had a few dozen gold left. After that, he went to the consignment store and spent 15 gold…</p>
<p>Wait, consignment… could it be…?</p>
<p>3000 Elementary Strength Crystals. Each were consigned with a price of 150 gold. If they were all were sold, then they would be worth 450,000 gold. After deducting the 5% tax from the consignment store, what would be left is… 427,500 gold!</p>
<p>Which is exactly how much appeared!</p>
<p>Ling Chen finally understood where this huge source of gold came from – they were all from when he was at Azure Dragon City, consigning the Elementary Strength Crystals to be sold! This means that the 3000 elementary strength crystals, in one day, were all sold!</p>
<p>Actually, after leaving Azure Dragon City yesterday, he had never checked how much money he actually had. This is because after leaving Azure Dragon City he had spent all his money, so there was no need to check it. In reality, he had no way to know if the 3000 Elementary Strength Crystals that he consigned were actually already sold in the early hours of today.</p>
<p>After players entered Azure Dragon City, the first things they did were to transfer jobs and upgrade their equipment. Naturally they would also try to find better energy crystals in Azure Dragon City. At this moment, the Luna Chain that the players have are the lowest level, except for a few who have high level Luna Chains. Therefore, they can only mount 2 energy crystals, thus they will be very particular with what they mount and of these two crystals, the one that they definitely will need is naturally a crystal that can increase attack. Increasing attack power is something that all professions will look out for. In addition, the Elementary Strength Crystal will be of the highest demand with this physical combat system. Azure Dragon City’s stores sell Elementary Strength Crystals for at least 200 gold. Because Ling Chen consigned it for 150 gold, in the time right now where currency exchange is unavailable, 50 gold is no small amount, so, the first player to see the consignment store selling Elementary Strength Crystals for 150 would have been surprised and immediately buy it. After that, the news of Elementary Strength Crystals being sold for 150 would have spread, then a large number of players would have flooded over, afraid that it would sell out. 3000 did not seem much, but with the vast Chinese player-base, 3000 was an inadequate supply. While the consignment store was still crowded with players, all 3000 would have already been sold.</p>
<p>Then the resulting 437,500 gold was automatically deposited into Ling Chen’s bag, making him unknowingly become a wealthy man carrying over 400,000 gold.</p>
<p>The market for Elementary Strength Crystals turned out to be so good as it only sold for one day before selling out… Ling Chen was ecstatic. He stopped with the nonsense and took out 10,000 gold, giving it to Qian Gun Gun: “Just then I forgot how much money I brought. I would never want to fool you… Now that I’ve made my payment, tell me what kind of place the Underworld is.”</p>
<p>With the 10,000 gold in his hands, Qian Gun Gun immediately smiled, looking at Ling Chen like a father. If he was willing to spend money for something that wasn’t even much of a secret, then this was definitely a super rich man that regarded money as nothing. He cleared his throat and solemnly said: “Relax, I Qian Gun Gun am absolutely credible and completely fair. The Underworld, also known as the Ghost World, is simply the place where people go when they die.”</p>
<p>As per the legends of the West, there is the “Underworld”. Legends of that place where people go after they die, are not very different from legends of the East. After hearing Qian Gun Gun’s words, Ling Chen lowered his brow and asked: “It is the place you go after death and the place where you are reincarnated?”</p>
<p>“Reincarnation? nononono” caught off guard, Qian Gun Gun was now shaking his head: “Of course not. Even though the underworld is on the forgotten continent, yet it is a different world from the forgotten continent altogether. The underworld was created by Hades, together with countless numbers of strong undead. Do you know what the undead are? Yes, the souls of the dead don’t scatter, but the death’s breath animate their dead bodies. Terrifyingly making them capable of movement. While you were getting here, you definitely would have faced many zombies. They are the lowest of the undead, the higher level undead can possess terrifying shapes and power. At an even higher level, they can appear like humans, with knowledge and wisdom beyond humans. Countless years ago, because of all kinds of war, the forgotten continent produced all kinds of strong and weak undead. These undead brought great disaster on forgotten island. Then, Hades appeared, Hades himself was an undead, and he was the strongest undead of them all. He and all of forgotten continent’s strongest undead creatures gathered together, creating a new world, and that place, was known as the underworld. The underworld was the undead world, under Hades’ control, the undead weren’t allowed to harass creatures in the outside world, but living creatures were also not allowed to enter. As the undead of the underworld grew in number, the underworld grew stronger, becoming a terrifying force. Even the lunar Goddesses didn’t dare offend them. With the great Hades, it is said that his strength was able to compete with the top three of the Lunar Goddesses, he is quite powerful.”</p>
<p>Qian Gun Gun’s underworld and what Ling Chen had in mind were completely different. Simply put, it is a world where countless undead gathered. Ling Chen thought… what kind of role does the underworld play in mystic moon? Could it be that players can only reach this world in the late game? That hades, has the same strength of the top three Goddesses… that is also to say, Hades has Saint Destroyer level of terrifying strength!</p>
<p>“The underworld is a world for dead people, the living are not allowed in there. You actually accidentally touched one of its entrances. But I warn you, the consequence of a living person going in there is becoming a dead person. Only high level undead can enter the underworld, they are all at least level 50. If you go like this, you’re dead. Where you are right now is where the Death’s breath is released, creating this deadly environment. The low level undead that are created in this environment aren’t eligible to go into the underworld, they can only wander about near the underworld entrance.” Qian Gun Gun said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Then how can you can enter? Don’t tell me you’re not a living person.” Ling Chen said with a stern look. He was certain, that this Qian Gun Gun character was a living person.</p>
<p>Qian Gun Gun had a look of pride on his face: “Have you heard the phrase, money makes the world go round, if you have enough money, nothing is impossible. For the sake of entering the underworld, I paid a blood cost. But after so many years in the underworld I have found many things, so it wasn’t really a loss. Now even Hades knows my name, allowing me access to the underworld. Tut tut. I have answered your question, the transaction is complete. I have nothing else to say, I’ll be heading off now.”</p>
<p>“Wait!” Ling Chen immediately called out, quickly asking: “The ‘scary bastard’ you were talking about before, who is it? Was it him that killed everyone that came by here?”</p>
<p>Qian Gun Gun “whooshed” and returned, pointing his finger: “Answering this question is a little risky, same rules as before, before asking questions you’ll need to pay… 500,000 gold.”</p>
<p>“500,000 gold!?” Ling Chen’s face darkened, he had to resist the urge to spit at his face. “Why is it so expensive?”</p>
<p>“That dark bastard is not some good master, if he finds out I gave away the reason for his disappearance, he will chase me across the whole continent to kill me. 500,000 is not that expensive.” Qian Gun Gun said with his eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>500,000, even if Ling Chen is willing to pay, he doesn’t have the money. He thought for half a second, and helplessly said: “Fine, then how about you tell me what kind of dangers are hidden in the Lonely Spirit Ridge? Why do people disappear when they are near this place?”</p>
<p>“2,000,000 gold. Fair deal, fair trade.”</p>
<p>“I! @#￥%…”</p>
<p>“hehe, young master, don’t be angry. Qian Gun Gun is greedy for money, but when it comes to selling goods or information he wouldn’t randomly make up prices. When he asks for more gold, is an indication for how important the information is or how precious the item is. If he wants 200,000, it means the information is worth 200,000. But young master doesn’t seem to have that much money… even if you can’t get the information, be sure not to offend him. Keep him around to continue making transactions. If he shows you some of his goods, then buy as much as possible… buy as much as you can afford!”</p>
<p>Qi Yue’s voice made Ling Chen swallow the angry words that were about to burst out of his mouth. Qian Gun Gun seeing that he hasn’t spoken in a while, idly scratched his nose: “Looks like you can’t produce 2,000,000 gold, oh well, I guess I’ll go about my own business. If you want to continue living, be sure not to enter that entrance.”</p>
<p>“wait wait wait wait!” Ling Chen immediately yelled out upon seeing him leave. Walking forwards a few steps, standing in front of him and staring at him before he said: “you said before that you found a lot of good items in the underworld, can you sell some that you aren’t using?”</p>
<p>“You want to buy my items?” Qian Gun Gun sniffed Ling Chen’s body, and his eyes lit up. “tut tut, this smell, there is at least 300,000 – 400, 000 gold. Not bad not bad, this encounter could be considered fate, I’ll take out my cheapest goods for you to see.”</p>
<p>After Qian Gun Gun finished talking, he moved quickly. The short stick in his hands flashed, and a list of items appeared before Ling chen’s eyes.</p>
<p>Success! Ling Chen said in his heart. Even though Qian Gun Gun will only let him see the cheapest goods, but as per the advice of Qi Yue, even if they are cheap items, they should all be extraordinary things.</p>
<p>He quickly concentrated, looking at the items that Qian Gun Gun flashed before him.</p>
