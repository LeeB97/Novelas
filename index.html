<p>Chapter 645 - Create History</p>
<p>Manchester United established their two-goal lead within five minutes in the first half, while Nottingham Forest smashed Manchester United’s advantage with two goals in ten minutes in the second half. Now the two sides were tied.</p>
<p>The result of the draw was also good for Manchester United, because even if they both tied, each team would still take one point and Manchester United would still win by one-point difference. But a football game was not a simple mathematics problem. To have an equalizer during this time, any fool would know that Nottingham Forest’s morale was running high and could score again if they were not careful.</p>
<p>Ferguson had to make some adjustments.</p>
<p>To attack? Of course not, he was going to defend. He had to play it safe at the last minute.</p>
<p>He replaced Rooney with Park Ji-sung who was more physically energetic and balanced between offense and defense to strengthen the midfield defense.</p>
<p>After Park Ji-sung came on, he relied on his abundant physical strength and the style of relentless running to launch a fierce interception against Beckham. Having run out of energy, Beckham was battered in the face of this defense. When the football was on his side, he basically could not organize any offense.</p>
<p>Twain also decided to change players. He replaced Beckham with Lennon.</p>
<p>When Beckham left the field, most of the people in the stands got up from their seats and stood up as they applauded the hero they once had. Beckham waved to the stands, not only to greet the Forest fans, but also to thank the Manchester United fans.</p>
<p>“David Beckham is replaced by Lennon. He received cheers from most of the fans in the stadium. No matter which team he had played for before, he deserves this reception now.” The commentator spoke affectionately, “This was the first time he has returned to Old Trafford as an opponent. No matter what the outcome of the game, his goal and assist will make people remember him forever …”</p>
<p>After he high-fived Lennon as he came off, Beckham stood on the sidelines and continued to wave to the fans before he turned around to walk toward the Forest team’s substitutes’ bench.</p>
<p>Standing on the sidelines, Twain reached out to him and said, “I can only describe your performance as perfection, David.”</p>
<p>Beckham smiled, but did not speak. After he shook hands with Twain, he went around to the substitutes’ bench and sat down.</p>
<p>Twain understood that he was here in a complicated mood because he scored a goal and helped with an assist against his former club. He did not take it to heart that he did not know what to say. So, he turned around and continued to watch the game.</p>
<p>This was the league tournament, not the Champions League. If the game was tied, then it would be a draw. There would be no overtime or penalty shootout to determine a winner and loser. Once this game was tied, the Forest team would still lose the league title. This was not what Tony Twain wanted to see in the end. He carefully prepared for so long and spared no efforts to inspire their fighting spirit. For the team to equalize the score at the most difficult time, it was not to get a draw.</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at the big screen with the game time on it at the Old Trafford stadium. It was less than ten minutes away from the ninety minutes.</p>
<p>How could they get another goal when Manchester United were carrying out measures?</p>
<p>To lure a snake out of its hole was certainly not going to work. Ferguson’s team was not stupid enough to be so gullible. It was better to show clearly that they were clinging onto defense. If they were to attack strongly… Manchester United’s rear defensive line had stepped up its defense against van Nistelrooy and the other attacking players. As the center forward of the Forest team, van Nistelrooy currently struggled to even turn around, not to mention making a shot. Arshavin was forced to the side which squeezed Ribéry’s position to the middle and the two players imperceptibly changed positions.</p>
<p>In that case… could they strengthen their long shots?</p>
<p>This was a method, but its effect was unknown. Moreover, to place their hope of a goal on this when every attack ended up abruptly, it would inevitably affect the morale of the team.</p>
<p>With one hand pinching his chin and frowning, Twain stood on the sidelines as he pondered.</p>
<p>On the field, the Nottingham Forest team was carrying out indiscriminate bombardment around Manchester United’s half of the field: A cross pass from the flank, a grab in the middle, a sudden long shot for the goal, a personal breakthrough, a straight pass the middle to attack … any methods were used.</p>
<p>For a moment, the situation on the field reversed. That scene from the first half reappeared on Manchester United at the last minute.</p>
<p>But for the sake of the championship title, Manchester United also accepted this bit of humiliation. Ferguson stood on the sidelines, looking grim as he worried that his team would not be able to withstand Nottingham Forest’s fierce offensive on and a loophole would emerge.</p>
<p>O’Shea had already returned to the rear defensive line and became a third center back. As the midfield line was so close to the rear defensive line, there was no need to set up a separate defensive midfielder.</p>
<p>But Ferguson was still a little uneasy. By all accounts, the Manchester United players on the field currently had strong abilities whether individually or cooperatively,. He did not know what he was worried about …</p>
<p>Perhaps part of Nottingham Forest’s reputation interfered with his mood?</p>
<p>Tony Twain’s team was one that did not concede even in the face of death. As an opponent, he did not dare to let his guard down even for a second, especially when they started to go crazy.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Time passed and the score was still 2:2. Manchester United was less than five minutes away from their tenth Premier League title trophy.</p>
<p>Even an attacking player like Cristiano Ronaldo had withdrew to the backfield to participate in the defense. Manchester United were almost completely without a counterattack. On the other hand, Nottingham Forest fully pressed on and turned out in full force. It could be said that except for Edwin van der Sar, almost everyone had pushed past the midfield and these players were well aware of what the draw would mean for them.</p>
<p>As Manchester United kept it tight defensively, Nottingham Forest’s offense was somewhat “all bark and no bite.” Although the scene looked menacing, nothing had been achieved.</p>
<p>Until later, George Wood could not stand it any longer and did a long shot from outside which missed straight away.</p>
<p>“It looks like Nottingham Forest is getting anxious. Such a hasty offensive blunder is unnecessary. It will only give Manchester United more confidence in holding the draw and agitate the rest of the Forest team more. George Wood is the captain and he shouldn’t show any agitation.” The commentator criticized George Wood harshly.</p>
<p>Off the field, Twain had the opposite view from the commentator. He rushed to the sidelines and shouted loudly, “Try to shoot more!”</p>
<p>Maybe a shot would be a waste of opportunity, but they would not have a chance if they did not shoot. Now that Manchester United was fully on the defensive, there was no way to threaten Nottingham Forest’s back. Their ball could even get past the midfield under the Forest team’s high press.</p>
<p>In that case, they just needed to shoot more and have a chance to break the goal as long as they hit within the goalpost range. As to whether they could score a goal or not, it was up to fate …</p>
<p>After Wood missed his shot, van der Vaart also tried to kick. His shot was within the goalpost range, but it was too straight on and Ben Foster easily confiscated it. The Forest team then stepped up the long shots, which looked a little like a desperate deathbed struggle.</p>
<p>The fourth official reappeared on the sidelines. He held up the electronic signboard in his hands. This time it was one of the teams that was going to change a player, but a reminder of the injury stoppage time which was four minutes!</p>
<p>“The time left for Nottingham Forest is only four minutes, and Manchester United is only four minutes away from their tenth Premier League title. Now every attack by Nottingham Forest will put the Manchester United fans on edge and hopefully Ferguson’s heart will still be able to withstand …”</p>
<p>Twain decided to change a player. He replaced the center back, Piqué with Bendtner. This substitution was a gamble with fate. He had to succeed or die trying. Bendtner could increase the strength of the Forest team in the box and cause some trouble for Manchester United’s rear defensive line. At the same time, his power and physical strength might also decide where the scales would tip in favor of the team to win or lose at the most critical juncture.</p>
<p>Bendtner ran onto the field, at which point the game had just entered the injury stoppage time, with four minutes to go.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo suddenly had an idea in his mind when he saw the Forest team replaced the center back. He pulled Scholes aside and said, “Paul, I think we can try to fight back.”</p>
<p>Scholes glanced at the Forest players and then nodded, “They’re almost undefended now …”</p>
<p>“Give me the ball.” Ronaldo felt like he’s in the right shape today. If the entire Manchester United team could not press out, then let him take the ball alone to charge ahead. “One more goal and this game is over. Even if there’s no goal, we can warn the Forest team to prevent them from attacking too hard.”</p>
<p>Scholes agreed with his idea. After the Forest team had finished another attack, Scholes asked Foster not to kicking a long ball, but to pass it to him. He got the football and passed it on to Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Following which, it was up Ronaldo’s individual performance.</p>
<p>Ronaldo caught the ball and used outstanding footwork skills to bypass Bale who rushed up. Then he suddenly sped up and started to dribble the ball to charge to the Forest team’s backfield.</p>
<p>At this moment, the Forest team’s latter half only strictly had Pepe and Edwin van der Sar. With large swathes of emptiness, the Portuguese could fully play to his fast speed, characteristics of his excellent skills and dribbled the football to stride toward the goal of the Forest team!</p>
<p>Seeing him like this, the Forest team rushed back to defend. Bale, Rafinha, Lennon and the others rushed back to catch up with Ronaldo. But the man who took the lead was George Wood. He began to pull back and prepare for defense after Ronaldo got the football. After he saw Ronaldo shook off Bale, he slashed across from the central area and plugged toward Ronaldo’s dribbling route.</p>
<p>Pepe also rushed over at the same time. At the final juncture, everyone was driven by a bloodlust. Who would take care to slowly retreat and procrastinate at this time? Pepe just wanted to intercept the ball from his Portugal national teammate and then took the opportunity to fight back. As a result,…..</p>
<p>“Ah! Ronaldo easily bypassed Pepe. He’s really fast!”</p>
<p>After he skirted around Pepe, only van der Sar was left in front of Ronaldo. He had a lot of options, but whichever he chose, he would be very, very close to the goal.</p>
<p>The fans in the Old Trafford stands began to cheer loudly as if they could see the glittering golden trophy in front of their eyes. Everyone stretched out their hands as if they were stroking the cool trophy …</p>
<p>Ronaldo looked up at Edwin van der Sar, and the other man seemed hesitant to strike. He smiled. Whether he struck or not, the result was the same, and that was …</p>
<p>“Pop!”</p>
<p>He suddenly lost his balance. Ronaldo saw the turf rushing toward his eyes. When he landed on the ground, he felt a sharp pain in his knee, and then a violent shock, which caused him to tumble continuously on the ground and almost rolled out of bounds before he stopped.</p>
<p>He could not even take a look at who the culprit was, for he was rolling back and forth on the ground, holding his knee in pain. The stands which were filled out cheers just now were replaced with deafening boos at this moment. The clamor was so loud that it could suffocate people!</p>
<p>George Wood sat on the ground, and not far ahead of him was Ronaldo in pain. Amid the sprawling hissing, he heard a piercing whistle.</p>
<p>Indeed, he did not hesitate to come up with a shovel behind Ronaldo who was about to cut inside. He did not think too much before he shoveled first and brought him down. He just wanted to shovel the player along with the ball. He was already aware of the consequences. He did not have to wait for the referee to come up and drive him away. He rose from the ground and walked slowly out of the field amid the boos,. The referee ran over and presented a red card behind him!</p>
<p>“This was an appalling foul and it was not too much to show the red card directly! Nottingham Forest had finally paid the price for their reckless offensive!”</p>
<p>Seeing that his treasured player was shoveled and made to fall, Ferguson was furious off the field, urging the team doctor to quickly get on the field to check the injury.</p>
<p>Twain looked at George Wood expressionlessly as he walked toward him.</p>
<p>The score was a draw with one-point difference. There were only a few minutes from the end of the game. And now George Wood was sent off with a red card. Was this the end of it?</p>
<p>Wood came off and said in a low voice as he passed Twain’s side, “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Twain gazed fixedly at the pitch but said to him, “Don’t go yet. Just stand at the mouth of the tunnel to wait for the game to end.”</p>
<p>Wood obeyed and moved back to stand at the mouth of the tunnel. He leaned against the wall, looking up at the game inside the pitch.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Ronaldo was carried down on a stretcher, and it looked as if he was badly hurt. Fortunately, Ferguson still had a replacement spot. He called Tevez from the substitutes’ bench behind him, intending to use this switch of player to waste the game time again.</p>
<p>The rest of Manchester United players prepared to execute this free kick in the front field. Thirty-four meters away from the goal toward the right, it would equally pose a big threat to the Forest team’s goal if handled well.</p>
<p>Vidic stayed in the backfield and Ferdinand ran up. As long as this attack succeeded, the game would be over. Nottingham Forest was absolutely incapable of consecutively scoring two goals in the last one and a half minute.</p>
<p>Edwin van der Sar nervously directed his teammates to defend against their opponents in the box. The human wall only had Bale alone.</p>
<p>“Don’t give them any chance!!” He cried aloud, “Push them out, push them out!”</p>
<p>Ferguson stood on the sidelines. Next to him was Tevez. Instead of changing a player now, he decided to wait for this free kick to start. It was certainly a good thing if they scored. If there was no goal but the ball went out of bounds, then he would decisively change the player and make use of this replacement to consume a little more time.</p>
<p>The free kick was carried out by Hargreaves. None of the Manchester United players grabbed it. Instead, Pepe snatched first and headed the ball.</p>
<p>The football did not go out of bounds. It landed at the foot of van der Vaart, who directly passed the football to Lennon on the side</p>
<p>Seeing Lennon take the ball, O’Shea wanted to come up and tackle it, but Lennon who was faster with his feet, stabbed the football between O’Shea his legs to bypass him and speed up to give chase to the ball. He got the football back just when it was about to go out of bounds!</p>
<p>“Fight back, fight back!” Twain waved his arms and chanted off the field.</p>
<p>This was the only chance …</p>
<p>Thanks to George Wood’s foul, Nottingham Forest had this last chance to fight back quickly!</p>
<p>Lennon dribbled the ball at high speed in the wing. He saw that Evra wanted to rush close and did not give him the chance. He suddenly kicked the football out ten meters away, and then sped up to chase the ball again. He easily got rid of Evra in this way!</p>
<p>His breakthrough was not hurried, and he mobilized his whole body. Manchester United’s entire line of defense followed suit to move to this side, so as to prevent him from cutting inside. Vidic cut across in front of him, Brown pounced to the middle, Ferdinand and O’Shea desperately gave chase.</p>
<p>“This is Nottingham Forest’s chance, but if they can’t grasp it, this game is over!”</p>
<p>Lennon glanced at the situation in front and he found that it was more difficult if he wanted to break through on his own. So, … he took a look at the front. Van Nistelrooy was preparing to run across in the front…</p>
<p>An opportunity!</p>
<p>Lennon pushed the football straight out from his feet and behind Vidic who rolled on the ground, van Nistelrooy had just diagonally plugged in and received the ball!</p>
<p>Vidic raised his hands to signal that van Nistelrooy was offside. But the assistant referee ignored it and ran forward along with van Nistelrooy.</p>
<p>“A beautiful set piece and it was not offside!”</p>
<p>After van Nistelrooy received the ball and cut into the box, Wes Brown rushed over to stop him from shooting.</p>
<p>“Don’t wait, just shoot!!” Twain anxiously roared off the field and wished he could go up himself to shoot for the goal.</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy felt the threat from the oblique rear. Ben Foster blocked in front of him, trying to seal off the angle of his shot. At this moment, there was only van Nistelrooy alone in Manchester United’s box. He could not fool the opposing defensive players by passing the ball. The acumen of a natural striker played an important role here.</p>
<p>After van Nistelrooy saw Ben Foster’s position, he firmly lifted his leg to shoot the football out and gave a decisive kick before Brown could shovel and intercept the ball!</p>
<p>The football jumped on the ground and went past Ben Foster’s hands to then fly straight toward the back corner of the goal.</p>
<p>At the moment, whether the Nottingham Forest fans, Manchester United fans, the people at the Old Trafford stadium or watching the game live in front of the televisions, all held their breath with their hearts leapt to their throats.</p>
<p>The next second determined all their fate.</p>
<p>As soon as the football was kicked, Brown’s leg arrived. Van Nistelrooy also did not bother to maintain balance and fell to the ground. But his eyes stared at the football he shot out.</p>
<p>The heart of the “King of the Six-Yard Box” beat wildly in an irrepressible frenzy at this moment. If it passed over the goal, then the team’s hard work for a season would be in vain.</p>
<p>He did not close his eyes like some people who did not dare to look. He kept his eyes on the football.</p>
<p>He saw the football hit the inside of the goalpost and then bounced through the goal line to fall into the net.</p>
<p>“Ah ah ah ah—this is just incredible! The ball’s in! The ball really went in! Van Nistelrooy’s absolutely killed it in the last minute! His shot kicked his former club to hell! Nottingham Forest reversed the score at the last minute and this one counterattack determined the owner of the title!” The commentator was almost deranged, but he was not really a Nottingham Forest fan …</p>
<p>Tony Twain did not rise up in one bound after he saw the football enter the goal. Instead, he went soft in his knees and knelt on the ground. It was too exciting. He almost thought it was over. It was not just the team would lose the title. He would also lose face big time in front of the entire English media. For someone like him who valued face, it was no different from killing him.</p>
<p>Thank God… for van Nistelrooy …</p>
<p>Kerslake suddenly embraced Twain who was kneeling on the ground and looking up at the sky from behind, and roared in his ear, “Tony! Tony! We’re the f**king champions, aren’t we? Manchester United doesn’t have a hope, right?!”</p>
<p>Twain let him hug himself. He had no strength at all. He could not stand up if he wanted to.</p>
<p>George Wood watched the game at the mouth of the tunnel and was the first to see the commotion coming from the Forest team’s substitutes’ bench. His teammates held their arms up in celebration at this moment and he knew that van Nistelrooy’s shot went in.</p>
<p>He leaned against the door with a sigh of relief in his heart. If the ball did not go in, he would have been a sinner who lost the title for the team …</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After van Nistelrooy saw the ball enter, he staggered up from the ground and ran toward the technical area with his arms held high in celebration. He had just run to the sidelines when he was crushed to the ground by a group of players clad in Nottingham Forest jerseys.</p>
<p>The jubilant players on the bench also ran up to join in the fun. A group of people celebrated wildly on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Rio Ferdinand who ran back to give chase, saw the ball enter the goal and immediately knelt on the ground. He held his head in his hands as he laid on the ground.</p>
<p>Ferguson looked up at the sky. He could not even utter a curse word.</p>
<p>This ending was really something… They could even reverse a two-goal lead. What else could they not do in the world? How on earth could they completely crush this team to death?</p>
<p>He could only seek the answers the next season.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“The referee blew the whistle for the end of the entire game! The Nottingham Forest players are still celebrating. There’s no need for the game to continue … Congratulations to Nottingham Forest! They have won the title for the 07-08 season English Premier League! This is the second top-flight trophy in their club’s history! Thirty years ago, Brian Clough and his men picked up the first top-flight trophy in the club’s history! Exactly thirty years later, Tony Twain has once again created history for the club!”</p>
<p>Twain finally had the strength to break free from Kerslake’s embrace. Instead of running onto the field to celebrate with the rest of the players, he went to the tunnel and pulled George Wood out to ask him to go up and enjoy this championship moment with his other teammates.</p>
<p>Then he reached his hand out as he walked toward Ferguson.</p>
<p>Despite losing the title, Ferguson still showed plenty of grace in front of his opponent. He took Twain’s hand and said, “Congratulations, you guys are … the champion.”</p>
<p>Twain smiled politely, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Without any more words, Ferguson turned and headed for the tunnel. The dejected members of the Manchester United coaching unit followed behind him.</p>
<p>After he watched Ferguson leave, Twain had just turned his head around when he saw a large group of players running towards him. He thought that the players were going to have fun with the “horrible game” of human pyramid. He planned to run away but was blocked by a group of reporters.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tony Twain, let’s talk about some of your thoughts with regards to the victory!”</p>
<p>“This was a really thrilling game. Were you confident that your team would win at the last minute?”</p>
<p>“Manager Twain, you won the Champions League title last season and won the league title this season. Nottingham Forest has risen so quickly. Do you have any secrets you can share with us?”</p>
<p>Before Twain could answer these people’s questions, he was lifted up and thrown into the air by a group of excited players.</p>
<p>“Oh, oh, oh! We’re the champions!”</p>
<p>The reporters followed the players’ movements and pointed both the cameras and the microphones in the air.</p>
<p>“Manager Twain, how do you feel at this moment? Let our readers and audience share your joy!” The reporters cried aloud below.</p>
<p>“How do I feel?” Twain turned his head and said as he was going up and down, “Right now I’m … right now… I feel, I feel like I’m … flying! In the clouds! In the clouds! Ah hahaha—we’re the champions!” He raised his arms and shouted.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 646 - Start Dating?</p>
<p>By the time Tony Twain and his team rushed back to Nottingham overnight with the league title trophy, this ancient city was once again revitalized with all the Nottingham Forest fans partying all night on the streets, in bars and even in their own homes. The whole city was drunk.</p>
<p>Twain naturally drank till he was as drunk as a lord and did not keep track of how much alcohol. There was no need and intention to. Anyway, it was one glass after another, one bottle after another bottle. What was considered to fully enjoy drinking without restraint? It was to drink to one’s heart’s content!</p>
<p>Twain was finally carried home by Dunn. He had no idea what happened after he was drunk. When he got up the next day, he found that he had blanks in his memory. He could not remember what happened last night for the life of him.</p>
<p>The headache from the hangover made him lie in bed for a long time before he could sit up.</p>
<p>This was the day after the league tournament had ended and sixteen hours had passed since that thrilling game yesterday. At the thought of the game, Twain felt as if he was still dreaming and that this was not real. Although he talked tough and said, “Our goal this season is to win The Double”, he was not prepared for what to do after he really won the championship title.</p>
<p>The team was on holiday today and did not have to train. When he thought of it, Twain laid down again on the bed. A hangover was really unbearable … Clattering sounds came from outside. He jumped out of bed and pulled back the curtains. The sky was gray with the pitter patter of rain coming down. It turned out that it was raining. It was cloudy yesterday …</p>
<p>When he saw the rain, he felt his mouth go dry. Twain went downstairs to find water to drink.</p>
<p>He had just filled a large glass with water and drenched his parched throat and lips when the phone rang.</p>
<p>“Uncle Tony!!” Shania’s excited voice came from the phone and startled Twain.</p>
<p>“You’re too loud!” Twain moved the phone away and said to the receiver.</p>
<p>“I’m happy! Congratulations on another championship win!”</p>
<p>“Yo, the news travels pretty fast.” Twain filled up another glass of water and sat on the sofa to chat with Shania.</p>
<p>“There’s the internet, hee hee.” Shania was in a really good mood from her voice.</p>
<p>“Is there anything you’re so happy about, Shania?” Twain asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it a happy thing for you to win the title?”</p>
<p>“Well, I meant to say if there’s anything that made you so happy?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t Uncle Tony’s happy occasion my pleasure too?”</p>
<p>Twain also smiled and said, “Little girl, how are you doing in America?”</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I’ve met some new friends. That movie will begin shooting in July. I don’t have many scenes, so I’m not particularly busy. It’s just that I still have to go other places for runway shows …” Shania gushed to Twain about her life and work these days. Twain also did not interrupt. He held his water glass and leaned back on the couch to quietly listen.</p>
<p>When she spoke to the end, Shania was suddenly quiet and then said in a low voice, “Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you can continue to speak, I’m listening.” Twain thought that because he had not answered for a long time, Shania misunderstood that he was not listening to her, so he hurriedly explained.</p>
<p>“I miss you so much …”</p>
<p>Twain froze for a moment and thought he misheard.</p>
<p>“Do you miss me, Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I miss you. How can I not miss you?”</p>
<p>“You’re lying!” Shania suddenly raised her voice again, “Aren’t you concerned that I’m alone here in a teeming world like Hollywood? Aren’t you worried that I might have a sex scandal? Does it not bother you that I might be bullied by some playboy?”</p>
<p>Twain was dumbfounded by the series of questions asked. It was not that he had not thought about them. He actually thought it was normal for Shania to find a boyfriend. It was not normal for Shania to remain single in the entertainment world like this. He used to wonder if it was Shania’s agency that asked her to do it … But Twain found it embarrassing to ask questions that invaded the privacy of others.</p>
<p>So, he never knew why Shania did not develop a relationship or anything like that. By all accounts, she was not young. She was seventeen years old. In today’s China, it was no longer considered puppy love to be dating at this age, not to mention the more open-minded foreign countries.</p>
<p>But how would he talk to Shania about that? Could he say, “I want you to starting dating?” Twain wanted to open his mouth and say so, only to find that he could not voice it. Was he hoping that she would or not?</p>
<p>The thought of such a beautiful and lovely clever girl getting cozy in the arms of a strange man, who could even be a grey-haired old man, Twain’s heart felt uncomfortable. This feeling was just like … as if someone had taken away his beloved toy.</p>
<p>Twain shivered as he was taken aback by his own thought.</p>
<p>That’s terrible … Why would I have such a thought? How could Shania be my toy? I’m just her temporary guardian in England, that’s all …</p>
<p>“Uncle Tony?” Shania thought it was a little strange when she did not hear Twain speak for a long while.</p>
<p>“Ah, uh, um … In fact, Shania … Well, you’re already seventeen years old. There’s nothing wrong with dating and falling in love …”</p>
<p>It was Shania’s turn to be silent this time. She opened her mouth and asked after a long beat, “Is that what you think, Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m worried about you being lonely in the United States. It’s nice to have a relationship, providing that the other person is sincere toward you …”</p>
<p>“Fine.” Shania interrupted Twain’s words and said, “I’ll listen to Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>After a simple farewell, she hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Twain sat alone stunned on the couch, holding his mobile phone and water glass. From the sound of it, Shania seems to be angry. That’s odd. Why would she be angry? Does she not want to have a relationship at this time? Then she could have simply said it. We are such close friends and can directly say anything to each other. If she’s afraid that it will affect her career or objections from her fans, she can speak up directly. I’m a flexible person. When she said fine, it felt like she was peeved … Did I say the wrong thing? Ahem, trying to figure out a woman’s heart is like looking for a needle in the haystack.</p>
<p>Twain remain perplexed despite much thought. He shook his head and drained the water from the glass before he stood up to go upstairs and get dressed.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Shania hung up the phone and sat angrily on the couch. Uncle Tony had cotton in his head instead of brains. She punched the Totoro soft toy in front of her with force.</p>
<p>Her agent, Fasal, happened to see this scene when he pushed the door open. But he did not ask anything and just said, “Mr. Colin Farrell has invited you to a party tonight …”</p>
<p>“I’ll go.” Shania raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Hollywood was brightly lit at night and monstrous and multicolored world under the glittering neon lights. This was home to the vast majority of the world’s stars. A paradise dreamt of and yearned by countless young men and women. Many relishing “stories” had been played out here.</p>
<p>Today, Shania would be the leading character in this story.</p>
<p>Sunset Boulevard was busy with traffic. With many high-end hotels congregated on this street, it was a good place for many stars to party and have fun once the night came. But it was also the preferred tourist destination for foreign visitors, because many tourists would always specially come here to encounter the stars they could only see on the television and movies.</p>
<p>Fasal parked the car in front of the hotel and the surrounding reporters suddenly swarmed up. The car door had not opened yet and the flashes were already popping endlessly. The doorman opened the door for Shania, as the long-haired Colin Farrell strode up to welcome.</p>
<p>“Oh, darling, I thought you weren’t coming!” Seeing Shania step out of the car in an evening dress, this sexy Irishman smiled and gave his hand.</p>
<p>Shania also smiled as she took his hand. Then she turned around and waved to the reporters’ cameras. The flashes became a swathe of blinding light, imprinting her and Farrell’s intimate pose in the cameras.</p>
<p>The evening breeze caress the people’s leaping hearts. This was bound to be a pleasant night.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain sat in the café in the training base and had a coffee break. After a day off, the team resumed training. Carrying out the overlapping method of two practices a day and one practice a day, the players who had just experienced the fierce game and then quickly relaxed, to gradually become tense again. After all, there was an important game waiting for them. This was not the time to be completely relaxed.</p>
<p>This cafe was actually a restaurant within the club. Some of the players and staff would choose to dine here rather than go home for meals. If Shania was not staying in Nottingham and when there were two practices a day, Twain and Dunn would have lunch here before heading to the office for a nap.</p>
<p>Kerslake had the dining plate in one hand, and a gossip tabloid in the other hand.</p>
<p>Twain smirked to Dunn next to him, “His son is already ten and he still likes to keep up with the stars all day long.”</p>
<p>Dunn did not say anything. He just laughed.</p>
<p>Kerslake heard Twain’s words and stopped at the table where they sat.</p>
<p>“I only have this little hobby, so don’t laugh at me. Besides, Tony, I saw the news of Shania here. She and …”</p>
<p>When he heard “Shania”, Twain’s ears pricked up. He grabbed the newspaper in Kerslake’s hand and flipped.</p>
<p>Sure enough, he saw a photograph in page five.</p>
<p>In the photograph, Shania hugged a long-haired man and smiled sweetly as she faced the camera.</p>
<p>“Who’s this man?” He asked.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that written on it? ‘The Hollywood playboy, Colin Farrell.’” Kerslake pointed to the papers and said, “They stayed out till late and then Farrell drove Shania home.”</p>
<p>“That’s a detailed introduction. He’s quite good-looking … he does have the makings of a playboy.” Twain looked at the picture.</p>
<p>“He used to have a bad reputation but he’s better now. He used to drink, use drugs, chase after women and was foul-mouthed… Now that he has a son, he quit drinking and taking drugs. But as for picking up women…” He noticed that Twain did not look very good. “Are you worried about Shania?”</p>
<p>Almost everyone in the club knew that Shania and Twain had a good relationship. But as to what extent, not everyone knew …</p>
<p>“No, she’s not a three-year-old kid who doesn’t know anything. I have nothing to be worried about.” Twain gave the newspaper back to Kerslake and went on to drink his coffee.</p>
<p>Sitting across from him, Dunn did not say anything. He just briefly looked up at Twain.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The players suddenly found that the boss who was supervising the afternoon training to be much harsher than in the morning. A little distraction and they would be shouted at and criticized by him outside the field.</p>
<p>“It’s really strange. We have just won the league title, but the boss looks like someone in his family had just died …”</p>
<p>“Guess he doesn’t want us to be too smug. After all, there’s still the Champions League final.”</p>
<p>“It’s not the first time we’ve played a Champions League final. Surely he doesn’t have to treat us all like kids, does he?”</p>
<p>“Then he must have been in a sudden bad mood!”</p>
<p>“Is he having his period?”</p>
<p>“Ah hahaha–!!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Shania was studying the acting materials at home with glasses on when she received a call. When she heard her cell phone rang, she was so excited that she jumped out of the couch and pounced on her cell phone. When she saw clearly who called, she was turned her mouth down in annoyance. But when she picked up the phone, no irritation could be detected in her voice.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mr. Farrell, hello. What’s the matter? Dinner? Hmm …” Shania thought for a moment and nodded. “Great, you can pick me up at my place at six o’clock in the evening!”</p>
<p>Fasal walked in when he heard Shania’s voice on the phone and asked, “Are you not having dinner at home?”</p>
<p>Shania nodded and said, “That guy, Farrell has invited me to dinner.”</p>
<p>“He’s trying to woo you, Shania.” Fasal said with a smile.</p>
<p>“I know. Isn’t that good? Uncle Tony wants me to start dating.” Shania pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“He’s not your father. You don’t have to listen to anything he says.” Fasal said tactfully.</p>
<p>Shania rolled her eyes and said, “He’s just being nice. Anyway, Mr. Fasal, don’t you think I’m a little lonely by myself?”</p>
<p>Seeing the strange look of her pulling faces, Fasal just smiled and did not answer this question. In fact, she was certainly lonely. If she did not have invitations from friends and celebrities, Shania would coop up in the house to watch DVDs, read or go online. Not to mention that she was a celebrity, even if she were to be an ordinary person, the entertainment activities were too few.</p>
<p>Besides, it was odd for a seventeen-year-old girl not to go on dates …</p>
<p>Fasal just asked her what time she would leave the house and then he left.</p>
<p>Following which, Shania was not in the mood to read. She kept staring at her cell phone from time to time, but until Farrell rang the doorbell of her house, her cell phone did not ring again.</p>
<p>As she scolded Uncle Tony in her mind, Shania dressed up to go out.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Ah, Shania has been so active lately. She went out to dinner with Farrell again …” During a break in the training, the players gathered in twos and threes to chat. The coaches would also gather to talk about topics of mutual interest. Because there had been news of Shania in the newspapers lately, Kerslake would always mentioned everyone’s acquaintance, Shania, at such times.</p>
<p>But Twain was not in a good mood. He wanted to tell off this star-chaser, but as soon as his mouth opened, he swallowed the words back. He had no reason to chide Kerslake, and he had no reason to be in a bad mood. He did not even know why he was like this.</p>
<p>Gee, the big game is coming. How can you be distracted by something like this at this time?</p>
<p>Twain shook his head and tossed aside these messy thoughts for the time being.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 647 - Preparation for Battle</p>
<p>“Just forget about the league title. Don’t think it’s going to be enough to get that.” On the training ground, Twain lectured the team.</p>
<p>After winning the league title, he sensed that there had been some laxity on the team. It had to do with the league title, which had made people feel that their mission had been completed and that however they played from then on, they had one championship title in hand and could have a good holiday.</p>
<p>Twain did not think so. Even though winning the league title was worthy of celebration, it was no reason to relax in preparing for the Champions League.</p>
<p>“The league title was delightful, but there are more lovely treats waiting for us: the Champions League title. Don’t you want to have a taste of defending the title?” Twain waved his arms as he painted a wonderful picture of the future for everyone. “Don’t relax! It’s hard to stir yourselves up after you relax. Now there are people out there who say that since Nottingham Forest has the league title, the best result is for Chelsea to win the Champions League title. It’s all bullshit! Why is it the best result to cede a championship title to another team? Are we here to fulfill another team’s wishes after we made it to the finals after much difficulty? Since we have advanced into the final, we must win the championship. Getting the first runner-up title would be a failure!”</p>
<p>At the end of the lecture, Twain handed over the command of training to Dunn and Kerslake, and went back to his office. Allan Adams was already waiting. They were going to discuss plans to go to the Far East to make money in the summer.</p>
<p>Twain was aware of the impact on the team of using valuable training time to fly halfway around the world to play commercial competitions. He had seen a number of precedents, but he had to obey the club’s arrangements.</p>
<p>In the first few seasons when he needed to buy players, the club’s finances always tried to satisfy him as much as possible. Now the team had achieved results, he naturally had to repay the club’s finances. Furthermore, the club was financially tight after the construction of the new stadium and needed to obtain money from somewhere to temporarily ease the situation. Going to Asia to play commercial competitions was the quickest way to see results.</p>
<p>Consequently, he could not refuse.</p>
<p>“We have been in touch with them and launched the campaign in four countries: China, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.” Allan did not even say hello when he saw Twain. He got straight to the point.</p>
<p>“Four countries?”</p>
<p>Allan nodded. “Five regions in four countries, including Hong Kong. Just treat the five games as the pre-season friendlies. He smiled at Twain, knowing that he and Twain were at odds.</p>
<p>Twain thought about it. There were five games before the season. The players would perhaps be physically unable to play more games after the long flight.</p>
<p>“What other activities are there besides the games?” Twain knew that for the team to travel all the way to Asia, it was impossible to return with just five games. Allan would not be that considerate.</p>
<p>“Well, there are three commercial events and a charity dinner, which requires everyone to attend. Beckham also has a number of specific activities arranged… You know, he’s the most popular person.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a hectic summer.” Twain shrugged.</p>
<p>After they finished discussing Allan’s work, Allan casually asked Twain, “Tony, the Champions League game on the twenty-first…”</p>
<p>“You want to ask how confident the team is of winning?” Twain guessed.</p>
<p>Allan nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s more effective to promote with the Double title, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Allan smiled. “You’re a smart man, Tony.”</p>
<p>“Ha, even if it’s not for publicity, I must get this championship title in my hands!” Twain clenched his fists. “So you can rest assured that when I said I want the Double, it means the Double.”</p>
<p>Allan glanced at the team training outside. He got up and held out his hand out to Twain. “Then Evan and I wait for your good news, Tony.”</p>
<p>After they shook hands, Allan said goodbye, and Twain went out to the training ground to continue supervising.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After the league tournament ended, the English media could focus hype on the Champions League final. Unlike the year before, this year was an English “civil war” which gave the English press a lot more to speculate on.</p>
<p>For the two managers, the media were determined to start a pre-match battle.</p>
<p>The Sun posted large photographs of the two men with a caption between the two photographs:</p>
<p>Grant? Who’s that?</p>
<p>When Grant had just taken over as the Chelsea manager, Tony Twain had said that to show his contempt. His remark held some sway because everyone thought that Grant was incapable of leading Chelsea, especially since his predecessor was so idiosyncratic that it left a lasting mark on the team.</p>
<p>Even Twain did not expect Grant to manage to lead Chelsea and stagger all the way into the Champions League final. It was the first time in Chelsea’s history that they had reached the Champions League final, knowing that even a powerful manager like Mourinho did not finish the initiative. The final had not been played yet, but Grant had already made history for the club.</p>
<p>With that contrast in performance, the Sun’s intention in bringing the remark to the surface again was clear — to provoke a new round of war of words between the managers and to mock and anger Twain, so that he would come out and publish another shocking article.</p>
<p>A headline was not enough. The Sun also listed the feuds and game record between the two teams in recent years. Tony Twain’s team had the upper hand, but it further stirred the Chelsea fans’ hatred of Nottingham Forest. After the media’s exaggeration of Tony Twain’s smugness and arrogant manner of despising everyone, it became more deeply rooted. The media were keen for the Chelsea fans to think that Twain felt that they did not need to play in the final because his team would win.</p>
<p>Supporters of both teams had not been idle, showing up one by one to give their views on the game.</p>
<p>John Motson wrote in his column on the BBC, claiming to be bullish on Nottingham Forest defending its title. Although it was difficult to defend the title, Tony Twain and his team were used to creating miracles. Furthermore, the match between Nottingham Forest and Manchester United had shown the team’s resilience, so he believed the final victory belonged to Tony Twain and Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Far away in Portugal, Mourinho remained concerned about the team he once coached. He was still dismissive of Grant, but, emotionally, he supported Chelsea’s bid to win. His reasons were quite his style — this is the team I left behind, I laid the foundation for the team for three years, and now Grant doesn’t have to do anything. He just needed to follow my routine and reap the rewards. But I’m still proud of the performance of the Chelsea lads. What? Ever since Tony Twain came to power, Chelsea had not been able to win against Nottingham Forest? That’s not a problem. This embarrassing record will officially be gone in Moscow on the night of May 21st…</p>
<p>In such intense battle atmosphere, Grant also eventually did not hold back. In an interview with Sky TV, he spoke about his personal feud with Twain. In fact, it could be considered an outpouring of grievances plus a counter-offensive. First he complained that he had never been acknowledged. Even if he had led the team to the Champions League final, the media still talked about whether he would leave again after the end of the season.</p>
<p>“Mr. Abramovich has just signed a new three-year contract with me. We are now hopeful of winning the Champions League title, which Mourinho’s Chelsea had never even made it to the Champions League final. I do not admit that the failure of the league tournament was due to me. There were too many liabilities from the first half of the season. I have been compensating for this ever since I took over this team. I think it is very good to be able to get to this point. I don’t understand why you’re still talking about my successor…”</p>
<p>Then he talked about that famous “who is that” incident. “Tony Twain is an extremely peculiar manager. He’s always so casual in judging others. I think we are long used to it. But I’m glad I now have the opportunity to prove ‘who I am’ in front of him.” These words held a great grievance. Apparently, the anger provoked by Twain had been increasingly accumulated in Grant’s heart, waiting for the right moment to explode.</p>
<p>This right timing was the Champions League final. What better revenge was there for Grant to feel great than to defeat the insufferably arrogant Tony Twain and his team in the Champions League final and then to pick up the trophy?</p>
<p>After Grant spoke, Tony Twain also jumped out to take on the challenge. He wrote in his column:</p>
<p>“I am glad that Mr. Grant finally understood his situation. He said he was happy to have the opportunity now to prove ‘who he is’ in front of me, stating that he himself understood that he needed to prove to me and that he did not know who he was until he had received my acknowledgement.”</p>
<p>These remarks caused the supporters of Nottingham Forest to burst into laughter, but almost made Grant fly into a rage. Obviously, he just thought about how to beat Twain, but unwittingly fell into Twain’s trap with words.</p>
<p>So, he fought back in the media again, but Twain did not take up a challenge this time. He said, “I loathe this behavior of attracting attention using one’s words before the game, so I’m not going to quarrel with Mr. Grant in the press. The title trophy does not belong to who can spit more saliva. I will not be involved in this kind of meaningless hype. I am sorry.”</p>
<p>These words choked Grant until he was dumbfounded. He had never seen such a shameless person… He had been happy to engage in a war of words with him before and now that he had gotten what he wanted, he immediately did an about-turn and back-pedaled. This excuse he used was high-sounding, but it was incongruent with his image!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Although Twain was full of contempt and disdain for Grant in the war of words, he was not stupid enough to believe that Grant was such a vulnerable opponent. Mourinho’s words were not reliable enough. To be able to bring a team that had undergone major personnel changes in the middle of the season into the Champions League final, they had to not have just relied on the team left behind by the predecessor to do so.</p>
<p>Twain fully inherited the glorious tradition of the older generation of revolutionaries. The way he would treat the enemy first was to strategically despise him, and then do not underestimate him tactically. He had said disdainfully, “Who is Grant?” In fact, since discovering that Grant’s team improving in the Champions League, he had been paying attention to this opponent. He did not know if Grant’s team would be able to reach the Champions League final, so he just treated him as an opponent they might encounter in the future. It had come in handy now.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s coaching unit had been gathering all the latest information about Chelsea, such as Ashley Cole was hurt in training, Lampard’s mother had passed away and so on. As long as there was information that could affect the game, it would be sorted out and put on Twain’s desk.</p>
<p>Although he had dealt with Chelsea many times and both teams were no stranger to each other, Twain believed the game on the evening of 21st had to not be the same as any previous game. Chelsea, which broke into the Champions League final for the first time, was bound to be hungry like a pack of wolves. Without their Manager Grant’s motivation, they would also be full of fighting spirit.</p>
<p>This time it was a tough opponent and it was not going to be an easy game. The psychological warfare had been played. Ultimately, it depended on how the two teams performed on the field to see which team the title belonged to.</p>
<p>Trading insults with each other really would not determine which team would take the title.</p>
<p>During training, Nottingham Forest focused on stepping up the tactical drills for penetration in the middle. Nottingham Forest established itself from the two flanks. While the wings were still strong, this had been thoroughly studied by their rivals and Chelsea would be on guard. Therefore, when they focused on defending against the two flanks, the Forest team would unexpectedly strike in the middle. He believed that it would produce a wonderful effect.</p>
<p>In addition, a set piece was always a wonderful move to break a deadlock and had to be practiced. At the same time, Twain decided to let the team practice the penalty shots, taking into account the various situations that might arise. Although he did not want the game to develop to that far, it was always good to be well prepared. In case the game was really dragged into a penalty shootout, it was better to be prepared than to be caught off guard.</p>
<p>As the day of the game approached, the various wars of words outside became increasingly fierce. The surroundings of the two teams’ training bases were filled with reporters from all over the world. But the two managers had ceased fire… The two men stopped all direct war of words and also avoided discussing this personal feud during the interviews with the reporters. They just talked about the team’s current training situation, players’ conditions, the prospects for the final… and these conventional subjects of no real value.</p>
<p>Compared to the previous fiery matchup between the managers, the players were much calmer when they talked about this game. It was just a final match.</p>
<p>In an interview with the reporters, Beckham admitted that he did not expect his first season with the Forest team to be so wonderful. Not to mention that they had won the league title, now there was a hope to win the Champions League title. He thought it was fantastic as he had never thought he would have a chance to stand on top of Europe again when he decided to transfer to Nottingham Forest. This also showed that his decision was correct and wise.</p>
<p>The media naturally lauded his accomplishments again.</p>
<p>In preparation for the Champions League final, Twain found that he suddenly developed a habit in a short period of time — he began to pay attention to the celebrity tabloids like Kerslake. From those papers, he could always find news about Shania. Compared to Shania when she first went to live in Los Angeles, Shania was currently much more active and frequently attended parties as well as commercial events.</p>
<p>Most of the time, that Hollywood playboy, Colin Farrell would definitely follow her around. They seemed to have a close relationship.</p>
<p>Whenever he saw news about Shania, Twain sensed that there was something was brewing deep in his heart that worried him. He was afraid that one day it would suddenly break out of his control and he could not tell what the consequences would be when that happened.</p>
<p>This sentiment had a growing impact on Twain as the Champions League final approached, so much so that when things were quiet for him, he would inevitably think about it. Twain felt that something was wrong with him, something extremely wrong. Going on like this was detrimental for while he prepared the team for battle and even for the final match. He had to think of a way to fix it…</p>
<p>He looked at the phone in his hand.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 648 - A Thing Like Love</p>
<p>Twain still decided to give Shania a call to have a good talk with her. He should not have been responsible for this sort of matter as her parents were still alive and well. But looking at the current development, her parents were clearly not in charge. In that case… Twain felt that since he was really like one of Shania’s elders most of the time, so it was a matter of course that he stepped forward to say a few words.</p>
<p>Listening to the ringing tone coming from inside the cell phone while he waited for his call to be answered, Twain let his imagination run wild. While he was busy preparing for the Champions League final against Chelsea during this time, he had not made another call to Shania. But was it really because he was preparing for the Champions League final?</p>
<p>Maybe he did not want to make that call.</p>
<p>This was good. She had made a new friend over there, and it was a man. He did not have to worry about whether she was lonely over there. Shania had to grow up sooner or later. He could not always take his first memory of when he first met her as the permanent impression. She was only thirteen years old at that time, and now fast forward five years later, she was almost eighteen years old. In China, one would be considered an adult at the age of eighteen … So, she should live her own life and have her own social circles. These things had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>“Sorry, the number you have dialed is temporarily not in service. Please try again later …”</p>
<p>“Strange.” Twain mumbled to himself as he looked at the phone screen.</p>
<p>He had wanted to put the phone down like this and get busy with other things. But looking at the name behind that string of numbers on the screen—“Little Girl”, he stubbornly pressed the call button again.</p>
<p>In fact, … I’m aware of all the reasons above, but why do I just feel awful? Is it due to that Colin Farrell? Ah, yes! It must be because of that guy with the bad reputation. Ah, I’m still so worried about this little girl in the United States. Why she can find young handsome guy with a nice character? Hollywood is full of young handsome people. Why does she take a fancy to an old guy who is about to be thirty-two years old! With a kid in tow! Oh my God… This world is too crazy!</p>
<p>Alcoholism, drug use, playboy … My little girl cannot be companion to that kind of man. I feel scared just thinking about it!</p>
<p>I absolutely forbid this kind of thing! Right! This is a major life decision; she cannot be hasty! She’s only a young girl with no experience and that shameful old man is an old hand at the affairs of the heart. He must have used charming words to deceive Shania. I have to make it clear to her that love is not like this … Definitely not!</p>
<p>Love should be … Love should be … Love should be …</p>
<p>“Sorry, the number you have dialed is temporarily not in service. Please try again later …”</p>
<p>“Bastard!” Twain cursed and pressed the green button on his cell phone again.</p>
<p>How should love be like … Ah, this is really a profound philosophical question. Anyway, it will not be a young girl who’s not even eighteen in embrace with an old man who already had a child and appeared intimately in front of everyone! It’s not in line with … common sense!</p>
<p>Twain gnashed his teeth at the thought.</p>
<p>What if she gets mad at me? But she’s never been an obedient girl who listens to me… Then I can only be a little fiercer. I must act angry and not back down! Yes, I can’t let her do whatever she pleases! Can’t let her have her way according to her temper. I hate spoiling kids this sort of thing the most hate! You’re going to get it from me this time, Shania …</p>
<p>“Sorry, the number you have dialed is temporarily not in service. Please …”</p>
<p>“FUCK!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Shania sat cross-legged on the couch, looking very seriously at the cell phone on the coffee table. The tiny pink cell phone rang out with melodious music and vibrated on several times as it slowly moved to the edge.</p>
<p>She wanted to see if the cell phone would jolt itself off the edge.</p>
<p>Half the body of the phone was suspended in the air. One more jolt and it would lose its balance. It was at this time that the sound of the music and vibration stopped at once.</p>
<p>Shania pursed her lips.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to pick up her cell phone, the music came on again! This startled her as her fingers touched the cell phone. The small phone did a somersault in the air and then fell straight to the floor.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Shania exclaimed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the floor was carpeted, and the cell phone avoided the fate of smashing into smithereens. Shania hurriedly picked it up from the floor and accidentally touched the answer call button.</p>
<p>“Sha-ni-a–!!” Full of anger, Uncle Tony’s voice, crossed the Atlantic and American continents, ignoring the barriers of time and space and broke out.</p>
<p>He was furious.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you answer my call!!”</p>
<p>Shania took her cell phone in front of her and did not put it to her ear. Even so, it did not prevent her from hearing Tony Twain’s clear voice.</p>
<p>“Uh … Uh …”</p>
<p>Shania was a little frightened when she heard Uncle Tony’s angry voice. She thought she had to find an excuse for herself this time, or she would have been scolded by Uncle Tony …</p>
<p>Shania anxiously scrambled on the couch and unwittingly hit the power switch on the television remote control.</p>
<p>A “beep” sound came on and the television in front of her was turned on. It was the Fox Sports channel, which was just showing the F1 race. Shania’s eyes lit up and turned the volume up.</p>
<p>“Ah! I’m sorry, Uncle Tony! I’m out shopping. It’s so noisy here, so I did not hear the phone ringing …”</p>
<p>The television speakers transmitted the “buzz buzz buzz buzz—-” noise of the F1 race cars zooming past the cameras at a high speed. It totally corroborated …</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain did hear the roar of the engine, but he was a little puzzled because the noise sounded so strange. There were no cars with such horsepower on an ordinary street …</p>
<p>Just as he was wondering, a faint voice loomed in his ear, “… Alonso overtook Button and now he’s in the pole position …”</p>
<p>“Click—” Twain’s hand gave a hard press, and the cell phone in his hand gave a whine.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Shania covered her mouth and stared wide-eyed as she was betrayed by her television so quickly.</p>
<p>“Shania …” He did not yell, but this low voice made Shania even more frightened. “You even dare to fool me …”</p>
<p>“Er, hehe—” Shania could only giggle.</p>
<p>“Turn off the TV and don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing.” Twain said coolly.</p>
<p>Shania had to obediently turn off the television, and the room was restored to peace again. Now the voice on the phone was clearer.</p>
<p>“How … have you been lately?”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain wanted to properly criticize Shania, but when he spoke, his words turned into “How … have you been lately?” type of greeting. It was a disgrace, and the momentum he had gathered deflated as soon as he made this remark.</p>
<p>He could only sigh with frustration.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>She originally wanted to keep a cold face to deal with Uncle Tony’s rant, but did not expect to be faced with a greeting and sigh.</p>
<p>That sigh crumbled Shania’s psychological defenses instantly—she was supposed to be angry with Uncle Tony, but now she could not even work up her anger.</p>
<p>“I’m good. I’ve got a boyfriend.” Although she was no longer angry inside, she did not intend to let go of the nasty Uncle Tony in words.</p>
<p>“Ah …” Twain froze. He’s really her boyfriend …. Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>“That won’t do.” He startled Shania with a sudden roar.</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“I said that boyfriend of yours won’t do!”</p>
<p>“Why not? He is good to me, a very gentle man and very romantic too … He’s so nice! Why ever not?” Shania asked with pursed lips.</p>
<p>“Tut! Is that kind of playboy considered good too? Gentle? Romantic? That are just moves an old hand at love uses to pick up girls!”</p>
<p>Shania covered her mouth and giggled, “It looks like Uncle Tony is also an old hand at love. Where’s your girlfriend, Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>“Don’t divert from the subject!” Twain cried, “I’m now educating you and not you giving me a lesson! I’m telling you, Shania, Hollywood is one big corrupted place. If you’re not careful, you can just …” He could not continue as the words that followed were not very nice sounding to a girl.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Uncle Tony?” Shania was unwilling to let go.</p>
<p>“Ahem, ahem.” Twain coughed a couple of times before he changed the subject, “Anyway, Shania. I think, you’ve just arrived there, so you’d better seriously learn first and focus on your career first. As for dating and relationship, you can take it slowly … And to be honest, I don’t feel at ease about that Colin Farrell. I don’t think he has the best of intentions…” Twain was justifying his actions. After all, interfering in the private lives of others was a bad thing in the Westerners’ views. Instead, he heard laughter which sounded like silver bells coming from the other end of the line.</p>
<p>“I still remember what I said to you at Armani’s dinner party—if I was going to find a boyfriend in the future, I would definitely come to you first and ask for your advice. If you’re not satisfied with him, I’ll let him go. What did you say at that time, Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>“What did I say at the time?” He did not recall clearly what happened a year ago. Twain was confused and did not know what Shania meant by suddenly mentioning the past.</p>
<p>“You yelled at me and said, ‘I’m not your father!'” Shania rather accurately captured Twain’s flustered and exasperated tone and said, “You see, now that I have not asked for your advice, you came calling on your own, Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>“Are you blaming me?” Twain asked with a frown.</p>
<p>“No.” The corners of her lips curled up as she spoke into the phone, “You don’t like Colin Farrell?”</p>
<p>This time Twain replied without hesitation, “I dislike him very much!”</p>
<p>Shania leaned against the couch while a soundless laugh played on her pair of slightly parted and alluring soft red lips.</p>
<p>“I tell you, Shania … You must be inexperience in this area. Your Uncle Tony is an old hand! You have to listen to me this time. Just from the looks of that Colin Farrell, you know he’s not a good guy!” Twain did not whether Colin Farrell was really a good person or not. Anyway, this was for the sake of Shania’s “lifelong happiness.” What did it matter if he had to discredit a person who had nothing to do with him? He was best at blurting things out without thinking.</p>
<p>“Ah, for a thing like love, you have to find a man… who has a sense of security which is the most important thing. He must be able to make you feel safe! Do you know that? Ah, Shania, the so-called sense of security is when you are with him, you will not be nervous and afraid. You won’t worry about getting hurt and be inexplicably upset … In short, you will feel safe and at ease as if you’re leaning against a wall … No, a mountain!” Twain clenched his fist and raised his voice as if he made an impromptu speech to his players in the locker room. “He can accommodate your everything. No matter what difficulties, setbacks and grievances you encounter outside, you can at least rely on him and sleep in peace! It cannot be replaced by some pretty words and sending nine hundred and ninety-nine bouquets of roses! He may not speak beautifully, do very romantic things, but he loves you, is willing to take care of you, dependable, willing to help you weather the ups and downs in life …”</p>
<p>Shania listened in a daze.</p>
<p>Twain was totally unaware that he had gushed out bits and pieces from his mind of how a man should be, observed from various places in his past. As he spoke, he even felt he should work towards the goal, because …</p>
<p>“This kind of man is too perfect …” Shania exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Listen, Shania. Love is for a lifetime. You can’t rush it, so you naturally have to have high standards and strict requirements.” Twain deliberately ignored the difference between “love” and “marriage.” In fact, marriage was probably a major lifetime decision…</p>
<p>“In a nutshell, I hope you will be happy all your life, Shania.” Twain meant these words from the bottom of his heart. He added, “But Colin Farrell cannot give you a lifetime of happiness. I do not approve of you with him, absolutely … absolutely not in favor!”</p>
<p>After she listened to Twain’s remarks, Shania was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Just as Twain thought Shania was still unwilling to accept his opinions, he heard her gentle voice said, “Thank you, Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘huh’?”</p>
<p>“There’s no ‘but’?”</p>
<p>“Why should there be a ‘but’?”</p>
<p>“General, isn’t ‘thank you’ followed by a ‘but’? Such as:</p>
<p>—-Thank you, Twain. You’re a good man. But we can’t be together. I only think of you as my brother (uncle)!</p>
<p>“There’s not a ‘but’!” Shania did not know whether to laugh or dry, “Thank you, Uncle Tony, thank you!”</p>
<p>Twain finally breathed a sigh of relief. It appeared as if Shania was going to accept his advice. He had just sighed when he thought of another question: am I being too thoughtless when I so roughly interfere in Shania’s private life? I should still apologize to her, right? Is it right for me to do this? Is it my place to do this? Do I have the right to say these things?</p>
<p>“Are you angry, Shania?”</p>
<p>“Angry? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because … Well, I interfered with your … private life …”</p>
<p>“Why would I be angry?” Shania happily said with a laugh, “You are my Uncle Tony. I can be angry with everyone, but I will not be angry with Uncle Tony! Besides …”</p>
<p>I’m actually very happy.</p>
<p>Shania did not say this. Instead, she replaced it with another reason.</p>
<p>“… Besides, you’re showing me concern. You’re being kind, Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>Twain was really relieved now. He said, “If you feel lonely and alone, just call me and don’t mind the time difference. Even if it is in the middle of the night in London, you can still call me. Or… when you’re not busy, come back once in a while for a break.”</p>
<p>Shania did not respond to this invitation. She just asked, “Do you miss Me, Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>This time, Twain did not repeatedly stress how much he missed her. He just uttered once, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. Whenever I’m lonely, I will think that Uncle Tony misses me, so I won’t be lonely!” Shania said happily.</p>
<p>“Silly girl …” Twain smiled.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>It was lunchtime on another training with two sessions of practice.</p>
<p>Dunn sat across from Twain and lowered his head to eat his seafood risotto, while Twain only drank coffee and ate sandwiches.</p>
<p>Kerslake came up to Twain with the papers and said, “It’s really strange that Shania dumped that Irish playboy overnight. It’s too soon for the rumored couple to break up, isn’t it? The papers stated that guy, Fasal, couldn’t figure out why Shania rejected him. I couldn’t figure it out too. Didn’t they seem to be getting on quite well before, did they?”</p>
<p>Twain did not grab the newspapers this time. He just drank his coffee and said leisurely, “Who knows? Who can tell with a thing like love? Maybe Shania thinks Farrell’s hair is too long?”</p>
<p>“What kind of reason is that?” Kerslake did not know whether to laugh or cry at Twain’s response.</p>
<p>Dunn, who was busy eating, glanced at Twain. The demon tail behind this man seemed to be swinging complacently.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 649 - Modesty Is Not A Virtue</p>
<p>Twain’s mood suddenly turned for the better. Using “everything becomes clear at once” to describe might not be appropriate, but it more or less meant that. He was no longer bothered by things outside the competition and dedicated himself in the research of the opponent and training. The people around him could feel the change. The Tony Twain of the two days again made them feel insecure because if the team’s leading general himself was distraught, the hearts of the troops would naturally be affected. Now all was well. His unknowing restless heart had settled down, and so the people around him settled their hearts as well.</p>
<p>As the final match was held in faraway Russia, the team had to travel there two days in advance to adapt to the venue.</p>
<p>Before he left, Twain took the tickets to Gavin’s grave. This was his routine as long as his team made it to the finals, he would do so. As with this habit, previously he would mail Michael Bernard a ticket. But this time, he clipped a piece of paper with it in the envelope. These words were written on it: “You don’t have to come, Michael. Just keep this as a memento.”</p>
<p>In front of Gavin’s tomb, Twain ran into George Wood, which surprised him a little. He said, “Is this a coincidence? We never ran into each other here.”</p>
<p>Wood looked back at his manager who held a bunch of flowers and said, “I don’t know. I don’t know when you’ll be here too.”</p>
<p>“Then why do we always pick the same day?”</p>
<p>“Because this is the only day the team ends training early.” The day they were referring to was today which was the day before the team traveled to the finals’ venue.</p>
<p>“What you said makes a lot of sense.” Twain crouched in front of Gavin’s tomb and put the flowers next to George Wood’s bouquet. He then pulled out a lighter and lit the ticket in his hand.</p>
<p>“Is that how you send him the tickets?” Wood saw this for the first time.</p>
<p>“Yes. I don’t know Gavin’s address in heaven, so I can only burn it for him.” Twain patted his hands after he burnt the ticket. He got up and looked at Wood.</p>
<p>“Gavin …. Will his father come back to watch the game this year?” Wood asked.</p>
<p>Twain shook his head and said, “No. He has his own life and football games are just a pick-me-up in life.”</p>
<p>“A pick-me-up?”</p>
<p>“They’re not professional players or career coaches. They’re just regular fans. Maybe football is life for us but it’s not like this for them.” Twain looked at Wood and explained. Then he asked, “How’s your mother?”</p>
<p>“Her health … has always been that way.”</p>
<p>Twain nodded to show his understanding. Sophia’s illness was the after-effects from a lot of hard work and running around over many years, the mental and physical stress of not taking good care of herself, not resting well and not eating well. Such an illness basically had no hope of recovery. It could only be controlled gradually. Until now, she still often needed to go to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>“George.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Take good care of your mother.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“So … will she go to watch the final on the 21st?”</p>
<p>“She wants to go but I won’t let her.”</p>
<p>“Oh?” Twain was a little puzzled when he heard George Wood said so.</p>
<p>“She’s not well enough to be able to be in a flight for a long time. I asked her to watch the live broadcast on TV at home.”</p>
<p>“Then you’d better play well!” Twain patted Wood on the shoulder with a smile.</p>
<p>“I’ve always play well…” Wood suddenly thought of the red card in that last game of the league tournament when he wondered how Ronaldo whom he shoveled to the ground and ended up having to be carried off on a stretcher was. He paid little attention to the reports in the media. “What happened to the Portuguese?”</p>
<p>“Portuguese?” Twain froze for a moment, and soon reacted, “Oh, you mean Cristiano Ronaldo? He… Well, he’s okay. He was well after he just took a few days off. Now he’s alive and full of vigor in the Portuguese national team’s training camp. You don’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>Twain exaggerated a little. Ronaldo did appear in the training camp of the Portuguese national team in preparation for the UEFA European Championship, but he was not vigorous and lively at all. Until now Scolari had not allowed Ronaldo to train with the ball. His mission was to regain his physical health and rest fully. Out of caution, the team doctors of the Portuguese national team advised Scolari to only bring Ronaldo on in the second game of the group stage.</p>
<p>As there would be UEFA European Championship and the Olympic Games this year, all the European leagues came to an end in succession. The players of the various club teams had gone to report at their respective national teams. Only Nottingham Forest and Chelsea had delayed their dismissal of the teams because they had to prepare for the Champions League final. Between the Champions League, European Championship, commercial games and Olympics … this summer would be very busy for the Nottingham Forest players.</p>
<p>Wood had no expression on his face, but he was slightly relieved in his heart.</p>
<p>This was not the same as the last time when he broke Rochemback’s leg with a kick. He tried to avenge Eastwood the last time. Whereas it was about their tactical needs this time. The needs of a game was completely different from “I just felt like doing it.”</p>
<p>“Oh right. About that foul, you did a beautiful job.” He had been busy with the celebration and the preparations for the Champions League final after the game. He was also busy worrying about Shania’s “major life event” and did not talk to Wood about that game. He was afraid Wood would worry that his red card had gotten the team into trouble. It was actually not like that …</p>
<p>“Without that decisive foul from you, we might have conceded the goal and wouldn’t have gotten that valuable chance to fight back. It was you who changed the course and outcome of the game.” Twain gave high praise to Wood. “You had been instrumental in us being able to win this league title.”</p>
<p>Wood did not smile with delight because Twain had praised him. He was always like this, and nothing seemed to betray his happiness or anger across his face</p>
<p>Twain was used to it and did not find it strange either.</p>
<p>“Let’s head back?” He said.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Wood nodded.</p>
<p>Before they left, Twain turned to look at Gavin’s tombstone and said, “We’re heading off to Moscow to play in the final, Gavin. If we can defend the title, I promise I will come back to see you with the trophy. Also, remember to go watch the game live.”</p>
<p>With these words, Twain and Wood walked out of the quiet cemetery side by side. The flowers swayed gently in the breeze, as if they were nodding.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>For Twain, the city of Moscow was no longer an unfamiliar place that could only be appreciated sporadically in a variety of films and television works. Nottingham Forest spent last summer here in the friendly matches before this season. This trip was down the memory lane.</p>
<p>“Luckily, Chelsea didn’t take the same flight as us.” On the way from the Moscow airport to the hotel, Kerslake said of their flight from the London airport. London Heathrow Airport was filled with the press, which at one point made one thought it had become the second “Fleet Street.” (note: It was once the street that was most concentrated with the British press and a symbol of the advancement in the British media. Now the various media outlets had moved out in succession and “Fleet Street” had become a symbolic label used to refer to the British media headquarters). Because Chelsea and Nottingham Forest coincidentally left the United Kingdom and headed for Moscow on the same day, so everything was thrown together.</p>
<p>“The media don’t think so. They must be very disappointed not to see the buzz.” Twain was always merciless in mocking the British media. “It’s like you dangle the bone in front of them but they are not allowed to take a bite.”</p>
<p>These two teams did not encounter each other before the game as the media had wanted. The airport made meticulous arrangements that prevented them from running into each other. Both teams also cared a lot about this matter and requested for the players not to wander around before boarding their flights. The current hostility between the two teams was so high that no one wanted any chaos to happen …</p>
<p>The bus stopped at the entrance of the hotel where the team was staying. A number of reporters had gathered there. After the players alighted the bus, they accepted a short interview before they entered the hotel. They went to their rooms according to the long-allocated room combinations to rest.</p>
<p>Twain took a little longer and was delayed at the hotel entrance. As the team’s leader and famous big mouth, he was more “favored” by the press.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to say. There’s been a lot of news about us lately, and it’s talking about the same old things. You don’t want me to put you off with something that’s out of date, do you?” Twain said aloud in the crowd.</p>
<p>“You can talk about the outlook for the final. What kind of results do you want to get?”</p>
<p>“No one wants his own team to lose, mate. Your question lacks standard.” Twain amused the other reporters.</p>
<p>Tang Jing was naturally in there. While everyone was laughing, she squeezed in and asked, “Since the restructuring of the Champions League, no team has ever successfully defended its title. Now that Nottingham Forest has a high chance, excuse me … Mr. Twain, have you fully assessed the difficulty of defending the title?”</p>
<p>If she had asked “Do you have faith in defending your title?”, Twain was bound to retort, “You’re talking nonsense.” She also learned to be smart in the process of constantly bickering with Twain.</p>
<p>Hearing this question, Twain nodded, “Any final game has a certain degree of difficulty. I actually think the Champions League final is the same as the final round of the just-concluded league tournament. But my and my players’ job is to face one difficulty or another, and then we’ll … kick them off! Are you satisfied with my answer, Miss Tang?” Twain winked at Tang Jing.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Tang Jing did not pay him any mind and continued to ask, “Can you talk about your trip to China this summer…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, that has nothing to do with the game the day after tomorrow. I don’t want to talk about that now.” Twain put on a matter-of-fact expression.</p>
<p>Tang Jing nodded to show her understanding and stopped any mention of other issues.</p>
<p>After responding to some of the other reporters’ questions, Twain squeezed out of the crowd and walked into the hotel. He was not hurrying to rest, but to hold a meeting attended by the entire coaching unit.</p>
<p>The preparation were in its final stages, so they could not be sloppy. He must take control of the team’s current form at all times. After all, it was not as if they did not have any problems on their side.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Just when Tony Twain returned to his room to hold the meeting with the coaches, Chelsea, which had arrived in Moscow a little later than they did, also reached the hotel where they were staying. The two teams were respectively in the north and south of Luzhniki Stadium, not far from the finals’ venue. If the weather was fine and the visibility in the air was good, Twain could also see the spire of the hotel building where Chelsea was staying through the windows of his room.</p>
<p>The Blues’ star player, Lampard, had just experienced the pain of the passing of his mother. After he alighted the bus, he expressed his wish to pay tribute to his mother’s spirit with the first Champions League trophy in the Chelsea club history when he spoke to the reporters. Terry and Drogba also said they hoped Lampard would score the winning goal in the game.</p>
<p>Although there was always leaked news of discord within the Chelsea locker room during the tournament, those who supported or did not support Mourinho, and those who supported Grant or questioned Grant, this team was more united than ever at this moment. All differences did not matter. They just wanted one thing in Moscow and that was to help the team win the final game, beat Nottingham Forest and win the Champions League title!</p>
<p>The players’ conduct made Grant, who then got out of the bus, very happy. A united Chelsea team increased his confidence of winning against Tony Twain.</p>
<p>Although Nottingham Forest had just won the league title and their morale was high, the final round of the league tournament drained a lot of their energy and it was said that Beckham’s old injury had relapsed. It was not known whether he could play in the final and news also broke about van Nistelrooy’s seemingly minor injuries during training.</p>
<p>Compared to them, Ashley Cole, who was previously injured in training, had returned from the firing line and had no problem playing in the final. Moreover, Chelsea had an easy game in its final round of the league tournament and their strength was assured.</p>
<p>And there was the most important point.</p>
<p>“Some press mention that Chelsea lacks the experience of playing in a Champions League final, but I think that happens to be our advantage. Compared to Nottingham Forest, which has already won the Champions League title, our players are hungrier for the honor, and their fighting spirit is more exuberant. This is something that Nottingham Forest cannot compare.” Grant spoke frankly with assurance to the reporters who surrounded him. After he came to Moscow, he was bursting with confidence, believing that this was the stage prepared for him, and that the protagonist must be himself.</p>
<p>“I believe in my players. At this point, I don’t want to talk about myself or my predecessor because it’s disrespectful to my players. To be able to reach the final, that credit belongs to the entire team.”</p>
<p>“… Of course, this is going to be a difficult game. Nottingham Forest is not a weak team. But we have the confidence to win. I know Chelsea has never won this honor in its history and I look forward to the prospect of returning to Stamford Bridge with the championship trophy.” Grant diminished his confrontation with Twain and repeatedly emphasized the team while at the same time, the confidence in his words had made the reporters sit up and take notice of this manager, who had been subjected to their doubts.</p>
<p>His performance was like that of a veteran manager who was neither nervous nor excited. He calmly knew what he should do.</p>
<p>After seeing the conduct of the entire Chelsea team, the BBC television pundits exclaimed, “This is really going to be a tough game because both sides must have the title. No one will concede in advance. In this instance, modesty is not a virtue.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 650 - The Tactical Meeting</p>
<p>“Mr. Fasal.” Shania found her agent who was reading alone in the living room.</p>
<p>“Ah, Shania, what’s the matter?” Fasal took off his glasses and looked back at her.</p>
<p>“Can I take two days off?”</p>
<p>“It will soon be the filming of your scenes, Shania …” Fasal had somewhat of a headache when he heard this request. He stood up and explained to Shania.</p>
<p>“When exactly?”</p>
<p>“The crew’s plan is to film your scenes on the 22nd.”</p>
<p>When she heard Fasal say so, Shania wrinkled her eyebrows and the tip of her nose turned up. She looked lovely even when she fretted.</p>
<p>Fasal guessed her intention to take a leave of absence, but he did not reveal, “Where are you thinking of visiting?”</p>
<p>“Moscow, Russia.”</p>
<p>Fasal smiled, “If it’s just to watch a game, one day is enough.”</p>
<p>Shania wanted to look for Twain after the game. Now it looked like time did not permit her to do so. She sighed, “Yeah, if it’s just to watch a game, there’s plenty of time. Help me book two tickets to Moscow, Mr. Fasal.”</p>
<p>“Two? I’m not going …” Fasal thought Shania was going to drag him to the game, but he actually had a lot of work to do himself. With Shania away, someone must be in charge of contacting the various parties here, must he not?</p>
<p>He did not expect Shania to roll her eyes and said, “They are for Clarice and myself.”</p>
<p>“Did she received a ticket too?” Fasal suddenly realized that it was Clarice Gloria, Twain’s friend. It was due to this relationship that Shania was also familiar with her.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Shania nodded.</p>
<p>“Sure, not a problem. As for Tony…”</p>
<p>Shania waved her hands and said, “You mustn’t tell him.”</p>
<p>“You want to give him a surprise?”</p>
<p>“No.” Shania smiled, “I just don’t want him to be distracted.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>A day before the game, Nottingham Forest held its last tactical meeting in the meeting room at the hotel where they were staying.</p>
<p>They would analyze the tactics and player combinations Chelsea might use in the final during this meeting, and what Nottingham Forest’s countermeasures would be. In addition to the manager’s on-field command, whether they could win in the game, would depend on the outcomes of this meeting. This was the concentrated embodiment of the entire coaching unit’s wisdom.</p>
<p>At this time, Dunn usually took centerstage, and Twain was only responsible for sitting on one side to listen.</p>
<p>Dunn spoke fluently in English with a Nottingham accent. He was very familiar with the English football and extremely proficient in the technical jargon. As for his performance in the usual work, there was simply no need for much nonsense. The English guys at the Nottingham Forest Football Club could not figure out how Tony Twain could encounter such a talent while he learnt conversational Mandarin through MSN online. Could it be that China was filled with such football geniuses in the country? It obviously did not make sense. Otherwise why was the level of Chinese football declining every year?</p>
<p>It could only be said that Tony Twain’s luck was surprisingly good!</p>
<p>“… Based on the intelligence gathered over the past few days, we speculate that Chelsea will send such a starting lineup in the final—” Dunn pointed to the tactical board as he said and drew Chelsea’s possible squad list to the players, “It’s Čech as the goalkeeper. The center backs are Terry and Carvalho, and the left-back is Ashley Cole, who returns from his injury. The right back is …”</p>
<p>The right back had always been a weak spot for Chelsea. Even though Mourinho had worked considerably on it during his time, the players whom he bought had always been less than satisfactory.</p>
<p>“We think it’s going to be Essien.” This was the result of a discussion by the coaching staff. The players would not know how this result came about and it was useless to tell them. They just needed to know an answer. At the time of the discussion, there was disagreement within the coaching unit about the pick for the right back.</p>
<p>Kerslake believed what Grant lacked was experience in the team, so he should send the former Barcelona player Belletti, who had experience in the UEFA Champions League final, as the starting right back. His view had been endorsed by half of the coaches. After all, what Chelsea lacked the most now was really experience.</p>
<p>But Dunn had a different opinion. He believed that Belletti’s state was unstable and he was too old. In such a fierce final, his presence would become a weak spot for Chelsea instead. On the contrary, Essien, who was used by Mourinho as a utility player, was more likely to appear in this position, not to mention that he had played as the left and right as well center backs when he first started playing. There was no question about his unsuitability.</p>
<p>Twain eventually came forward to make a decisive opinion. He said, “If Chelsea send Belletti, then their right wing will be the area we focus on attacking. Grant must have known how sharp Nottingham Forest’s flank offense is. While Belletti’s defense is completely of a different level as compared to Essien, forget about how big that guy talked before the game. When the final is being played, he is bound to be steady, at least in defense. So Essien, who is good at defense and has outstanding stamina, is more likely to be in the position of the starting right back.”</p>
<p>“Lampard, Makelele, Ballack, and Joe Cole will be starting in the midfield. The forwards are Malouda and Drogba. It looks like the 4-4-2 formation, but it can turn into 4-3-3 once the game starts. Joe Cole’s position moved forward into a winger and Drogba is in the middle. He and Malouda are each on the left and right. Three players stand parallel in the midfield.”</p>
<p>Having finished with Chelsea, it was the time to release Nottingham Forest’s starting lineup. That was what the Forest players were most concerned about. It was an honor to play in the Champions League final.</p>
<p>The Champions League final was not the same as the league tournament. The rotation system could not be easily utilized. The strongest squad must naturally be deployed.</p>
<p>“The goalkeeper is Edwin van der Sar.” This was without a doubt. As long as the experienced Edwin van der Sar had no injuries and in a stable form, he must be the main force. No matter how talented Akinfeev was, he could only be a substitute.</p>
<p>“Pepe and Piqué, you’re the center backs and both of your main tasks are to clamp down on Drogba. Don’t let him get active and use your physical advantage to squeeze him out of the box. Don’t give him a chance to shoot. Tony does not want to see him on the field in the final.”</p>
<p>The two people nodded to show that they understood their mission.</p>
<p>“The full backs are Gareth Bale on the left and Rafinha on the right.” This was a lineup of full backs full of attacking force. It should be completely clear from this area what Twain had in mind—he wanted to suppress Chelsea’s two flanks in the final with his offense on the sides.</p>
<p>“In the midfield, we have George Wood, van der Vaart, Ribéry and …” Speaking up to here, Dunn paused a little. He looked up at Twain sat next to him, and then continued, “Lennon.”</p>
<p>This decision was a little surprising. Beckham was hurt, but after all, it was only a minor injury. It had not reached the point of him not being to go on the field. However, under the long-standing strict disciplinary requirements, there was no hubbub in the meeting room over this. Other than Lennon himself was somewhat startled, the others looked as per normal.</p>
<p>Dunn was still reading the starting list while Twain secretly observed everyone’s expression, hoping to learn about their inner thoughts through the subtle changes in their expressions. In the moment the name “Lennon” came out, a look of disappointment instantly flashed across David Beckham’s face. This tiny change did not escape Twain’s eyes.</p>
<p>“The forwards are van Nistelrooy and Eastwood.”</p>
<p>The Danish kid Bendtner waited patiently until the end but did not hear his name. Unlike Beckham, his disappointment was displayed in his speech.</p>
<p>It was an admirable achievement that Nottingham Forest had advanced into the Champions League final for three consecutive seasons since the 05-06 season when he joined the Forest team four seasons ago. But for Bendtner himself, it was not worth mentioning, because not once was he in the starting lineup … As a star of tomorrow with high hopes pinned onto him, this treatment was a little humiliating … He was the main striker in the Denmark national team and yet he had no chance of being in the starting lineup at Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>When Viduka left, he once thought his future at Nottingham Forest was bright. He did not think that Tony Twain would change hands and bought van Nistelrooy whom Manchester United did not want! In this way, as a powerful center forward too, he was again forced to accept the reality that he could only be a substitute for van Nistelrooy. At first he thought with the increasing age of van Nistelrooy, his state would certainly decline. Then it would be his chance to rise. He did not expect …this old gun, van Nistelrooy progressively played better in Nottingham Forest, and only injuries could beat him down. For nearly two years, he only had minor injuries that were not enough to affect his form and playing time.</p>
<p>At this thought, Bendtner suddenly felt that his future at Nottingham Forest was gloomy …</p>
<p>Twain was still observing when Dunn had begun to explain the Forest team’s specific tactics in the game.</p>
<p>“… We will hold fast to defense in the starting fifteen minutes of the game. Then the two full backs will actively plugged in. George Wood will move back in the midfield while van der Vaart will move up to the attacking midfielder position. Ribéry’s and Lennon’s position will slightly shift inward. Dunn drew the team’s formation on the tactical board as he spoke. The shape of a rhombus was in the midfield. But unlike the general classic 4-4-2 diamond formation, this diamond layout was not too elongated in that the distance between the attacking and defensive midfielders were widened. In fact, it appeared to erect the elongated diamond formation.</p>
<p>With Ribéry and Lennon retreated inward, they became the relay stations connecting the defensive and attacking midfielders on the midline while also giving way to the forward plug of the two full backs. In the actual game, if they plugged in straight ahead, it would directed in front of Chelsea’s flanks. If they moved obliquely, they could go to the sides and also go to the middle. In short, they could decide according to the situation on the field and become very flexible. And van der Vaart would be very close to the frontline position, so his task was not to be a playmaker, but only be responsible for the final pass, or direct long shot. In that case, who was responsible to be the playmaker?</p>
<p>“George.” Twain stood up and took over from Dunn to say, “The positions in the game have to be much more flexible than what they are now on the tactical board. You are the starting point for defense to turn into offense, so you’re the playmaker.”</p>
<p>George Wood was a little surprised. To let him organize the offense in such an important game, was Tony Twain all right in his mind?</p>
<p>But Twain did not explain further. After this, he just sat down again and gave the lead back to Dunn.</p>
<p>The tactical meeting went on, but some people had become distracted …</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After the meeting, the players left the meeting room in succession. Twain stopped David Beckham to speak to him in private.</p>
<p>Everyone knew why Twain has asked Beckham to stay behind. It must be due to that starting list. He might have to explain. Bendtner turned his head and looked at Twain and Beckham, who remained in the meeting room. He was somewhat jealous. Why was it that he too was not on the starting list, but Beckham alone was asked to stay behind to listen to the manager’s explanation and not himself? This really a reality that was unacceptable to him …</p>
<p>Everyone left, and Bendtner stood at the door of the meeting room to watch it being closed. At which point, he reluctantly turned and walked away.</p>
<p>In the empty meeting room, Beckham sat across from Tony Twain each other. He looked at Twain opposite and said, “You asked to see him because of the starting list, boss?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to call me ‘boss’ when it’s just the two of us here. Just call me ‘Tony.’” Twain scratched his head and wondered in his mind how to better broach the subject. “Well, I know you may be a little disappointed with that.”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I am a little. Although I’m old, I’m still eager to play in the Champions League final again. But I know you must have your reasons for this arrangement. You’re the manager. Although we are good friends, I and you have the same attitude when it comes to the games.”</p>
<p>What kind of attitude? It was to put the team’s requirements as the priority. Beckham was a world-class star player, but there had never been a scandal in his career that had him contradicted the team’s manager because he wanted to get a chance to play. On the one hand, he always had a steady stream of appearances, and on the other hand, it had to do with his work ethics.</p>
<p>Twain was grateful to Beckham for understanding him in this way. Everyone knew he had a good personal relationship with Beckham. If Beckham used this relationship to coerce Twain to give him a steady starting position, then Twain would not be able to manage the team, because the team would be divided into two factions like “the manager’s cronies” and “general relationship with the manager.” At that time, a division would be inevitable.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Beckham had never done anything like this to make the manager lose every scrap of his reputation.</p>
<p>“Yes, the only reason is a tactical need. Lennon has the ability to plug forward. He and Ribéry can fully disrupt Chelsea’s defense on both sides …”</p>
<p>Beckham did not speak. He did not plan to make a case for himself to play. Anyway, he had to abide by what the manager decided. In his final season at Real Madrid, Capello did not like him, so he put him on the bench. He could only silently accepted it. He only chose to leave at the end.</p>
<p>Twain was also aware how cruel it was to do this to a veteran eager prove himself again. This could probably be the last chance of his career to stand on the field of the Champions League finals, but he could only be a spectator.</p>
<p>“But you’re on the substitutes’ list.” This might be a comfort as he said, “It’s also a tactical need, so I may bring you on. After all, your long shots and passes can still cause Chelsea a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>Beckham smiled.</p>
<p>Twain felt something was wrong, and he asked Beckham, “Is there a problem?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think it’s not good for you to do this, Tony?” Beckham said.</p>
<p>“Not good? Which area do you mean that is not so good?”</p>
<p>“You specifically ask me to stay behind to tell me not to worry about not being on the field, that I’m on the list of substitutes and that I have a chance.”</p>
<p>“Er …” Twain still did not quite understand what Beckham meant.</p>
<p>“Tony, what would those players who did not get on the starting list think?”</p>
<p>“Oh!” Twain finally realized.</p>
<p>“Don’t do this next time. I’m not a kid who doesn’t know anything. Although you always say to treat everyone equally, sometimes I think you don’t treat me like an ordinary player.”</p>
<p>Twain looked at Beckham and laughed foolishly. Ah of course, as a fan watching you grow up, you have been with me for more than ten years of my youth. Although I try my best not to, I also can’t completely think of you as a regular player …</p>
<p>Like Albertini, some people have long left an indelible mark on my short twenty-six years of life. I watched them appear for the first time in professional football as a tender teenager, and watched them victorious, win championships and gorgeous women in their arms. Then I watched their experiences of failure and frustration and eventually slowly fade out of people’s minds in the face of the pain and injuries…</p>
<p>You say, David, how can I think of you as an ordinary player? I express that in words because I do not want to let my feelings completely overwhelm my rationale.</p>
<p>Your signed contract with me is only for two years. You said that if you can still play two years later, you have to go to the United States to accompany your wife. Because Victoria gave up her two years to satisfy your selfishness and you have to give back to her in double. Now, there’s only one year left. I sent off Albertini a year ago. What gift should I give you as a send-off a year later?</p>
<p>I can’t say what will happen in the future. So, just for this year, it will be the game tomorrow.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing else, can I go back?” Beckham asked.</p>
<p>Twain snapped back to reality and nodded, “Get a good night’s sleep, David so that you have energy tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“You think of me as a rookie again.” Beckham helplessly gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Ah … I’m sorry.” Twain tapped his forehead. “Bye, David.”</p>
<p>“Bye … boss.” That was what Beckham said when he went out and closed the door.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Only when Twain was alone in the meeting room, did he sit down and lean on the back of the chair, breathing a long breath.</p>
<p>Another final showdown was impending. How many such showdowns had he experienced since he somehow transmigrated here and became the manager of this team? He could not keep count for a long time. At first he would think of them as his first, second, third match. Later, it became—which number is this? Who cares about that! All I have to do is win!</p>
<p>Yes, quantity is meaningless. Only the results are valuable. In the next ten, twenty years, I will also experience more such showdowns. It’s really stupid to rue over such a thing.</p>
<p>This is just a small step in my coaching career.</p>
<p>Twain got up from his chair, turned off the lights and walked out the door.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 651 - Win to Show Them</p>
<p>At the dawn of May 21st, after Twain was awakened by the trickling sound of rain outside the window. The rain hit the glass window and emitted a continuous sound. Only then he noticed that it really rained today. The weather forecast yesterday just stated that there might be rain, so the tactical meeting gave the team two sets of preparations. Different preparatory work was required for competing in the rainy and sunny environments.</p>
<p>Opening the window, the early morning cold wind poured in the eleventh-floor window and sent shivers down Twain’s naked spine. The temperature in the room’s air conditioning was not that different from the outside. If it had not been raining, this weather would have been perfect for playing in the final.</p>
<p>In the misty rain, the spire of the hotel where Chelsea were staying in the distance was no longer visible. The enormous building of the Luzhniki Stadium was faintly discernible. Twain stretched his back, turned off the air conditioner, got dressed and washed up.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the outside of the Luzhniki Stadium gradually became lively.</p>
<p>Coming from the United Kingdom, the fans from both sides poured into the stadium, while a number of television media vehicles also arrived. The construction cranes were still busily hanging the team flags of both teams in the final above the main entrance wall of the stadium, in order to separate the fans of the two teams and let the excited crowds of people respectively enter the two tunnels in accordance with their own supported teams to prevent chaos—everyone knew what the English fans would do after drinking too much.</p>
<p>The sponsors’ flags were hung all over the square around the stadium, fluttering in the wind amid the patter of rain.</p>
<p>Some people just thought of this as a holiday, while the others poured all their enthusiasm into it.</p>
<p>“Third time! For the third time in a row!” Skinny Bill shouted excitedly as he stood right in front of the Luzhniki Stadium, looking up at the giant Nottingham Forest emblem hanging directly above the gate.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that Michael is not here with us …” Someone behind him sighed.</p>
<p>Fat John patted him, “He has his own life now. We also have our own lives. Our lives are here again to witness the team pick up another championship trophy! At that time, Bill should shout ‘The fourth time, the fourth time!’”</p>
<p>“Ah haha—”</p>
<p>“Nottingham Forest—Champion! Nottingham Forest—Champion Champion!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Built half a century ago, the stadium was now home to two Russian Premier League teams—FC Spartak Moscow and FC Torpedo Moscow. Today, it temporarily belonged to the two teams from England—Nottingham Forest and Chelsea.</p>
<p>Pierce Brosnan followed his fellow reporters and walked into the stadium. The fans had already begun to go through the tickets check for the admission. Everything was orderly at the scene with a large number of policemen on patrol duties and the meticulous security measures. But Brosnan knew that the real test was actually at the start of the game and after the end of the game. The losing side must have people who would do something bad because he could not accept the cruel reality and was emotional. If alcohol and the opposing fans’ verbal provocation were involved… then it would a disaster.</p>
<p>Some reporters from England had gathered to eat the free fast food offered by the stadium while they discussed with interest whether the Premier League was already the world’s number one football league. Then the conversation quickly turned into whether English football was number one in Europe.</p>
<p>Brosnan had no interest in such a topic. He did not eat the free dinner provided by the stadium but took a packet of milk to drink. He was not hungry, but a little thirsty. At the same time, he glanced around and looked at the stadium stands, which were gradually filled up. This was a comprehensive stadium. Once the main venue for the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics, there was also a synthetic running track outside the field, which made the stands a little far from the field. The English spectators might be a bit unaccustomed to this. But Pierce has no such trouble. As a reporter, he had seen all kinds of stadiums, following the team around the world. This summer, he would also follow the team to China to visit that mysterious country.</p>
<p>Some people in the crowd recognized Pierce Brosnan. With the rise of Nottingham Forest in the European football world, the [Nottingham Evening Post], which had always followed and reported on Nottingham Forest, had gained fame and a reputation in the press circles. He was no longer a former unknown intern.</p>
<p>They enthusiastically invited Brosnan to join in the discussion of this topic—just how strong was the English football?</p>
<p>Brosnan felt that the group had eaten their fill and at the bursting point—they still had the rest of their unfinished food in the food packaging held their hands— what was there to discuss about this topic?</p>
<p>As a result, he mercilessly poured cold water on this.</p>
<p>“Two teams from England have reached the UEFA Champions League final, but ironically our England national team didn’t even get into the final stages of the UEFA European Championship.”</p>
<p>Once he said this, everyone was silent. They did not relish being spectators and watch the other teams’ actions this summer.</p>
<p>“Hey, Pierce. You’re sounding more and more like that bastard, Tony.” Someone expressed dissatisfaction. After all, it was a little annoying to disturb the mood of the other people’s conversation.</p>
<p>“Too acrimonious for your taste?” Brosnan was delighted instead of being angry. He thought of Dunn, who was brought to Wilford by Twain three years ago, when he was taciturn like an autistic person, which caused the Britons who knew nothing about China at one point to think that people all over China were like that.</p>
<p>We are all influenced by that man …</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>That man was sitting in the team’s bus at this moment, waiting at the gate of the stadium for the police car to open up a path and lead them into the designated parking area. The others were busy with their own affairs. Some people listened to music, some people shut their eyes and the others waved at the fans below. On the other hand, he looked at the Lenin statue in the square.</p>
<p>As someone who was born after 1980, it still felt a little different to see a statue of Lenin.</p>
<p>Ah, dear Lenin in Heaven, though your communist flag has not yet been planted around the world, my red color of my Nottingham Forest team is on the verge of becoming the main hue of European football of this era. Come, let the whole of Europe and the entire world tremble before our “Red Terror!” Whoa, haha …</p>
<p>Sitting next to Twain, Dunn found suddenly him laughing. He strangely turned his head and asked, “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“No, nothing.” Twain looked at Lenin outside and smiled, “I just had a daydream that overnight, the whole world became red.”</p>
<p>Dunn thought, “That would increase a lot of people with high blood pressure …”</p>
<p>“Idiot!” Twain scolded, but Dunn had pulled him out of his beautiful vision. He found the sky outside had darkened and the streetlights around the stadium were all lit up. Through the exterior walls of the tall stadium, the lights in the stadium flooded and lit up the skies.</p>
<p>It was still raining, but Twain did not worry about the bad weather for the entire night, like he did the first time he advanced into the Champions League final. Rain all you want; my team combats in all kinds of weather!</p>
<p>“Go do your warmups! It’s a little cold this evening, don’t let your joints get rusty by the rain! Warm up your bodies!” Kerslake’s loud voice rang at the door of the locker room. This had become a routine before every game.</p>
<p>At his urging, the players were afraid to stay any longer in the locker room. They changed into their clothes and ran out. Then they passed through passageway and went into the curtain of rain.</p>
<p>“Tony.” Kerslake called out when he saw everyone gone, and it was only Twain left in the locker room.</p>
<p>“Yes?” Twain’s did not open his eyes. He sat in his chair to rest himself.</p>
<p>“The rain is getting heavier out there.”</p>
<p>“I see. Thank you, David.”</p>
<p>Kerslake nodded and turned to run out.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When Kerslake came out of the locker room to enter the field, Dunn was already overseeing the players with the other coaches during the warm-up training. He walked over to Dunn’s side and watched the warm-up for a while. Then he shook his head and said, “This turf condition is terrible.”</p>
<p>Dunn nodded in reply, “They hastily replaced the turf only to meet with such a rain.”</p>
<p>“Even if they don’t change the turf, it still sucks.” Kerslake lowered his neck and grimaced, “Artificial turf … is terrible.”</p>
<p>Due to special weather reasons in Russia, it was a great expense to maintain natural turf in the various club stadiums. And because it was difficult for the natural turf to survive in winter and in the cold weather, most teams played in the dirt. In this way, the possibility of injuries to the players was greatly increased. Given these circumstances, the UEFA approved the use of artificial turf for the game at Luzhniki Stadium a few years ago. Since then, the stadium had become a “devil’s home ground” in a different sense.</p>
<p>Because of the particularity of artificial turf, the football’s movement on this was very different from being on the natural turf. Therefore, a lot of teams who were used to playing on the natural turf were likely to suffer. In addition to the players more likely to be hurt on the artificial turf than natural turf, another biggest difference was that the football’s rolling speed on the artificial turf was faster. The rebound law was not the same and was more slippery than natural turf. If there was water, it was no different from an ice-skating rink. During McClaren’s England team’s away loss to Russia in the UEFA European Championship qualifier, the Russians were helped a lot by the artificial turf in addition to the English team’s own physical problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, before this game, the two competing clubs negotiated with the UEFA for the turf at Luzhniki Stadium, arguing that a Champions League final on artificial turf would be bad for both sides’ playing. The beauty of the game and the quality of the final would be greatly diminished.</p>
<p>The artificial turf at Luzhniki Stadium was eventually replaced with natural turf before the game, following the negotiations between UEFA and Moscow. Just how long and effective this turf, hastily laid, could last in the heavy rain, was really a big question mark.</p>
<p>“We can only hope that the drainage system at this stadium will be fully utilized …” Dunn murmured.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When the players ended their warm-up and returned to the locker room from the field, everyone looked like a drowned rat. Each of them had a stack of neat dry towels and jerseys in their chairs.</p>
<p>“Don’t catch a cold. Quickly dry yourselves and change into dry clothes.” Kerslake also walked into the locker room, looking drenched all over. He did not care to wipe the water beads off his face and yelled first. He was really a dedicated assistant manager.</p>
<p>“What’s the situation of the field?” Twain asked Dunn.</p>
<p>“It’s going to have some adverse effects on the game.” He did not say “it’s going to have an adverse effect on us” because he knew this adverse effect was against both teams in this game.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to worry about. We have a headache and so does next door.” Twain shook his head and did not take the weather seriously. He was in a more relaxed mood now than he used to be when he faced such a situation.</p>
<p>The locker room was messy and noisy, as everyone was busy changing into his clothes. Some people even turned on the music to relax. Twain and Dunn as well as Kerslake also chatted casually. Where was the slightest tension before the final? If a Nottingham Forest fan were to suddenly break in and see this scene, he was bound to be disappointed with the team’s behavior.</p>
<p>But when Twain ended his chat with the people around him and got up from his seat, this was all over.</p>
<p>The players consciously calmed down, and the noisy rock music came to a halt.</p>
<p>“All right, all right, guys.” Twain waved his hands and motioned for everyone to sit down. He did not want anyone to stand taller than him.</p>
<p>“This is another final. Huh, why would I say ‘another?’” Twain amused everyone with an opening. They certainly did not laugh because he imitated Stephen Chow’s lines, but because their actual situation was such—they had always faced all sorts of finals since they followed Tony Twain and always brought together with a championship final.</p>
<p>“We always have a destiny with the championship titles. Since we returned to the Premier League four seasons ago, we have advanced into three Champions League finals. We even picked up the EFL Cup while we were still in the Football League First Division. And we won the Premier League title again this season. There aren’t many teams in international football that are so crazy about taking the championship titles like us. But I don’t want you to have any fatigue after you get these championships, because …”</p>
<p>Twain paused a little. He had to keep this group in suspense.</p>
<p>“Ever since the restructuring of the UEFA Champions League, there has not been a team in the football world that can succeed in the great undertaking of winning the title two years in a row. When I said, ‘a great undertaking’, it was absolutely no exaggeration. There’s a big difference between winning for the first time and defending the title. I personally think it’s harder to defend the title than to win for the first time. Why? Because we’ve become targeted. We have become targets! Those people crouch with shotguns in hidden corners which you can’t see and will try to take shots at you when you let your guard down! Fortunately, we didn’t get knocked down by them and went all the way to the final … Without any controversy, we broke into the final for three years in a row! It’s a remarkable achievement, guys! But it will be even more remarkable if we could break into the final three times in a row and pick up the trophy two times in a row!” He brandished his arms hard, and Twain’s “showtime” had come.</p>
<p>“Why not? No team has ever done it. So why don’t we be the ‘first men’ to do so?! Think about it, a long time after this game, people will say this about Nottingham Forest: ‘They are the first defending champion to succeed after the restructuring of the Champions League!’ Also, a championship title, but we’ll win the best and most distinctive championship title! There are a lot of teams in the world that can win championships, but they’re not like us because we’re Nottingham Forest! Even if we win the championship title, we will win more beautifully than those teams! What’s so great about winning a championship title? Not only do we want to win the championship, we also have to win our place in the history!”</p>
<p>There was already a whining sound from the mouths of the players below, but it was not to hiss at Twain. It was because of their excitement and uncontrollable desire to scream.</p>
<p>“The UEFA Champions League has been around for fifty-three years and there are countless teams and players who have won the titles. But today, you have the opportunity to carve your names forever on that trophy, engraved in the history of the Champions League, and etched in the history of European football! As long as you win the championship title.”</p>
<p>Twain looked at the people around him. He was satisfied with the emotions of these men.</p>
<p>“Do you hate being a champion?” He asked aloud.</p>
<p>“No!” The players also replied loudly.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid to be a champion?”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>“Will you feel sorry for your opponents for winning too many championships titles?!”</p>
<p>“Impossible!”</p>
<p>“Then go out there and win! Win to show them!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 652 - Tough Guys</p>
<p>A large-scale cultural performance was underway on the field in Luzhniki Stadium, but Shania, who sat in the VIP box, paid no attention to it. She came here just to watch the game and did not even go shopping.</p>
<p>She just wanted the game to start early now, because if the game did not start, Uncle Tony would stay in that mysterious locker room and not come out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the cultural performance soon came to an end. As the fans at the stadium took the cheers up another notch, the players of the two teams’ starting lineups finally filed out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>The glittering silver trophy was placed directly opposite the exit, separating the two teams. The Chelsea players could not help but turn their heads as they passed by the trophy. This was the first time for a lot of people in the team to be at close contact with the honor. Would they pick up the trophy with their own hands after ninety, one hundred and twenty minutes, or more?</p>
<p>The Nottingham Forest players also looked at the trophy, with a feverish glow in their eyes. The boss is right. No team has been able to defend its title since the restructuring of the Champions League. So why can’t we make history and create a miracle again? Nottingham Forest is a miraculous team. We are here on this stage to create history and miracles. Why else are we here for?</p>
<p>As the players from both teams entered, Twain came out from the side with the rest of the coaching staff, as well as the substitutes. The group of Nottingham Forest fans close to the Forest team’s technical area, all cried out excitedly when they saw Twain came out, “Tony!! Hey—-Tony!”</p>
<p>Twain heard their shouts, turned and waved, with a serious expression on his face.</p>
<p>“You know what we want! Champion! Champion Champion—”</p>
<p>This group of fans howled as they watched Twain arrived at the technical area.</p>
<p>Then Twain stood there. The rain was slightly lighter, but it still gradually dampened his clothes and hair. He did not intend to sit back in the technical area to shelter from the rain. His players were lined up on the pitch to take pictures and perform some of the necessary ceremony before the game.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“He’s so cool.” Sitting next to Shania, Gloria whistled.</p>
<p>Shania looked warily at this Hollywood successful career woman who had come with her to Moscow to watch the game.</p>
<p>Noticing Shania’s small gesture, Gloria smiled, “Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>“He’s a fool, so not cool at all.” Shania pursed her lips.</p>
<p>Gloria went from a smile to a guffaw.</p>
<p>“You’re both fools, haha!”</p>
<p>Shania pouted. It was not that she did not want to make a retort, but it looked like she was unable to refute …</p>
<p>“Do you need my help, Shania?” Gloria winked at Shania.</p>
<p>Shania knew what she was talking about, but she shook her head and said, “No, thank you, Clarice. I want to work it out on my own …”</p>
<p>Gloria saw this young girl’s insistence and said no more.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>George Wood, the captain of Nottingham Forest, lost when he did the coin toss with Chelsea’s captain, Terry. As a result, Chelsea were given the right to pick the side, while Nottingham Forest was given the right to kick off.</p>
<p>The groups of cultural performers had long since dispersed. The players on both sides had finished their photo-taking, and both teams stood in accordance with their formations on the field. A big battle was on the verge.</p>
<p>It was not until the kickoff whistle sounded that Twain turned back to his seat. The suit he wore had long been drenched by the rain. Dunn handed over a dry towel to let him to wipe the water off his face.</p>
<p>“It’s exactly as we predicted.” Twain smiled and said to Dunn after he observed Chelsea’s starting eleven players. He mentioned “we.” But in fact, Dunn guessed right for all the contested positions. The standard of a genuine football coach was indeed different.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid to blindly select to ‘surprise’ in this kind of final, it will not yield good results.” Dunn had his own reasons and considerations. “Grant is not a gambler, or more accurately not a pure gambler. At this time, he still cares more about ‘stability.’”</p>
<p>Twain nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the final game of the 07-08 season Champions League! The two teams are Nottingham Forest and Chelsea from England. This is the first time the latter team has advance to reach the Champions League final in the club’s history while the former is the defending champion. This is an ‘English civil war.’ Chelsea and Nottingham Forest have a lot of feuds in their domestic league, such as the most famous being since the return of Nottingham Forest to the Premier League, led by Tony Twain, Chelsea has never beaten them in the league or the Champions League. Perhaps this could be a small curse? In this sense, Chelsea may have a certain psychological disadvantage up against Nottingham Forest in this game.”</p>
<p>However, during the pre-match press conference, Grant had already flatly denied such a bullshit psychological disadvantage. He did not want to talk about this embarrassing record at all. The reason was simple. He did not feel disgraced that he had not defeated Nottingham Forest before, but that this rotten record was left to him by his predecessor, Mourinho. So, he felt he had no obligation to make up for this for the dismissed Mourinho.</p>
<p>He also made no mention about such topics as how many games Chelsea had not beaten Nottingham Forest in the locker room before the game. Perhaps this might provoke a strong fighting spirit in the players, but Grant was afraid that it might backfire instead and cause the players to slip into a real psychological disadvantage. After all, he was not an expert who was eloquent enough to mobilize the emotions of his players in the locker room.</p>
<p>He told his players that Nottingham Forest’s most threatening offensive means were their two flanks. Consequently, Tony Twain was certain to consciously strengthen the team’s offense on the sides in this final. Chelsea had to focus on the wings during defense, and they had to pit against them—if Nottingham Forest goes the wings, we will go through the wings too.</p>
<p>As Grant had expected, Nottingham Forest took advantage of the expediency of their kickoff at the start of the game, and resolutely launched an attack through two wings from the start.</p>
<p>At fifth minute, after Gareth Bale actively plugged ahead he passed the ball from the back of the wing. The football hit Essien, who was the guest player for the right back position, on the leg and changed direction to drilled straight toward the nearest corner of the goalmouth. Fortunately, Čech had not moved his position and immediately fell to the ground to stop the football. There was no loss except that it startled the Chelsea fans and made them gasped.</p>
<p>“Argh!” Bale looked frustrated. He held his head in his hands. If the ball had unexpectedly gone in, the final might have been easier to compete in.</p>
<p>He was still upset but George Wood had already called his name from a distance, “Go back, Bale!” He asked Bale to return to defend because this ball did not get out of the end line but was caught directly by Čech. Van Nistelrooy interfered with Čech in front of him to keep him from launching a quick counterattack. But he could not overdo it for fear that it would attract the referee’s “special attention” for himself.</p>
<p>Čech bypassed van Nistelrooy and indeed threw the football to Essien, who was going to counterattack from that side.</p>
<p>Grant had instructed the entire team to pit against Nottingham Forest’s flank offensive and fight measure for measure before the game. What did he mean by measure for measure? That was, if Nottingham Forest started the attack from the left, then once they intercepted the ball, they would immediately counterattack on their right which was the Forest team’s left to take advantage of the void after the Forest full back had plugged in. Success would be a chance to directly threaten the opponent’s goal. Even if it was not successful, it could also make the Forest team’s two full backs sprint back and forth and exhausted themselves from running. They simply could not withstand for ninety minutes in such a high-intensity game. It would be Chelsea’s chance once their strength dropped, their movements collapsed, and their attention lacked focus.</p>
<p>Once he saw Essien got the ball, Ribéry rushed up to the front field to intercept and interfere while Gareth Bale did not dare to delay further at the front. He turned and darted back to defend.</p>
<p>Twain certainly anticipated that Grant would do that. It was not a remarkable tactic. The whole world dealt against teams that liked to use the full backs to assist in offense with this move. Nottingham Forest’s flank offense was known all over the world, and these two offensive full backs were known to the world. Only a fool would not take advantage of the gaps behind them while they plugged ahead to assist. But they could not restrict the two full backs for this reason and instruct them not to assist. That would be equaled to cutting themselves off at the legs. Therefore, Twain’s strategy was layer upon layer of defense. From the forward line in the front field to the midfield and then to the rear defensive line, they would carry out counter-pressing and interference, to give the full backs who came up to assist, enough time to return to defend.</p>
<p>As for their stamina, he was not very worried since both Gareth Bale and Rafinha were young players with their fitness and speed in ascendancy. They would not be particularly tired as long as the team took control of the situation on the field.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>This was just a tentative attack for Bale. Following which, Chelsea also attempted to attack, and then the two teams began to tacitly focus on defense. No one wanted to concede a goal at the start of the game. This was the final. A goal concede implied too many possibilities. Neither Twain nor Grant wanted the game to possibly develop beyond his expectations.</p>
<p>Although they were focused mainly on defense, the game was not dull. No one scored yet but the two sides scrambled quite fiercely.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s slight adjustment in its formation made Chelsea unable to adapt and played somewhat awkwardly. Van der Vaart positioned himself more to the front and could almost be counted as a “shadow striker.” In this way, he was clearly a bigger threat to the Chelsea goal than if he remained with George Wood at the back. In addition, Ribéry and Lennon withdrew inside to the flanks of Chelsea’s entire formation. This position caused Chelsea to feel very uncomfortable defensively—between the center back and the full back, it was a little like the undetermined merging of the urban and rural area.</p>
<p>As a result, the initiative on the field was firmly in the hands of Nottingham Forest during this time. Fifteen minutes later, Nottingham Forest began to use this initiative to increase the intensity of the attacks.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth minute, Ribéry’s shot was thrown out by Čech after he forced a breakthrough from the flank after he received a pass from Wood.</p>
<p>In the next two minutes, Bale plugged in to assist again. He lifted his leg to pass after he received the diverted ball from Ribéry. Unfortunately, no one could get into position in the penalty area and the football overshot above the penalty area to fly directly to the other side. Chelsea intercepted the ball and simply counterattacked.</p>
<p>Ashley Cole orchestrated a counterattack after he received the football.</p>
<p>He first did a feint to bypass Lennon who rushed up, and then decisively passed the football on to Ballack after he saw the Forest player’s intention to counter-press.</p>
<p>Ballack leaned back to block van der Vaart after he got the football and glanced at the situation on the field.</p>
<p>Chelsea had to admit they were caught off guard by the Forest team’s turnaround. But Twain also had to admit that it was a little risky in doing so—they were too dependent on George Wood. With van der Vaart, Ribéry and Lennon all moved forward in their positions, the latter half of the midfield was basically defended by Wood alone. As long as the other side used the passes to divert him, the opponent could pass through the midfield without resistance and directly face Nottingham Forest’s rear defensive line. For Chelsea, which had many long-shot masters, facing the rear defensive line also meant going within the firing range.</p>
<p>Makelele and Lampard were running forward, and George Wood chose to defend against Lampard. After all, Lampard was a lot more threatening than Makelele when it came to offense.</p>
<p>Ballack saw this scene and immediately twisted the ball up from under his feet to pass a high ball to directly fly toward … Makelele!</p>
<p>Wood ran halfway when he saw this situation. He hurriedly braked and turned around to pounce toward Makelele.</p>
<p>“Chelsea’s counterattack! As long as Makelele can pass the ball to Lampard, he will have room to play!” The commentator cried aloud.</p>
<p>The football was still in the air when Makelele saw George Wood came charging up. He knew Wood was strong and that this offensive could never be stopped here. Otherwise Nottingham Forest would surely take advantage of the opportunity while they were all plugged ahead to directly attack their goal from the middle.</p>
<p>Fight on!</p>
<p>The two men jumped at the same time during the high-speed run and rushed towards the football.</p>
<p>It looked like Makelele would get to the ball first. His wealth of experience had helped him. The charging Wood was less nimble in the air than on the ground. If the other person was destined to get to the ball, the only way to stop it was—he bumped Makelele on the forehead!</p>
<p>A muffled noise sounded, and the football bounced out as the two people tumbled to the ground. No one stood up.</p>
<p>Referee Ľuboš Micheľ’s whistle rang out. Judging by his hand gesture, it was George Wood’s foul. This penalty sparked displeasure among the Nottingham Forest players. They thought that with the collision of two players in this 50-50 ball, how could he have decided that it was the Forest team’s foul?</p>
<p>The Chelsea players were also equally mad. Such a ferocious impact was a simply murderous attempt on Makelele! What were the Forest players protesting about?</p>
<p>The two teams quickly swarmed together and looked like they were going to break out in a big fight. The tense atmosphere brought about by the final match spread from the first second of the game and was now close to a boiling point.</p>
<p>“Bastard! What are you doing?!” Chelsea’s Malouda pushed away the approaching Ribéry and yelled, “Do you want to fight!?”</p>
<p>“You f**king hit our men!” Ribéry wanted to rush up and punch this black guy, but he was tightly gripped by Lampard.</p>
<p>“Push them away for me!”</p>
<p>“Bale, what are you going up there for?”</p>
<p>“Damn it, calm down!”</p>
<p>“Take a look at our player. Who was the one who fouled?” Van Nistelrooy protested loudly to the referee as he pointed to George Wood, who was slowly turning over and sitting up.</p>
<p>The referee followed his gaze and looked down. He then hurriedly signaled for the stretcher to be brought onto the field.</p>
<p>This “Ironman”, “Tough Guy”, “Alien”, “The Terminator” and “Shrek”, who hardly ever suffered any harm during the games, now covered his eyes with his right hand as red blood seeped through his fingers. While Makelele weakly curled and sat up as his hands covered his head with a painful expression.</p>
<p>It looked like the two people were badly hurt.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Damn it, damn it, damn it—damn it!” Twain agitatedly paced up and down in front of the technical area. The team doctor, Fleming ran up with his men, followed by a stretcher. “Tell them to calm down! The game has only started for twenty minutes! Damn it, it’s not the first time they’ve played in a final. How is it that each of them is like a barrel of gunpowder, ready to explode at the first spark?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because George actually got hurt …” Dunn said in a low voice.</p>
<p>There was such a “legend” in Nottingham Forest that was not known to outsiders: George Wood was a monster that would never get hurt. No one in the world could break him at all on the football field and on the training ground. While it might be exaggerated to say so, there was a sense of security as his teammate to watch Wood never completely at a disadvantage no matter which opponent he was up against.</p>
<p>Could it be that this monster’s weakness was his head?</p>
<p>“You look at how he and Makelele are doing. Who seems to be hurt more seriously?” Twain pointed to the field and asked aloud.</p>
<p>George Wood sat on the ground with his head down as his hands held his bleeding wound. Other than that, there was no other strange area. Makelele, for his part, curled up with his hands on his head and seemed to be shaking—was he twitching from the shock?</p>
<p>Oh my god!</p>
<p>The team doctors of both Chelsea and Nottingham Forest had already stormed into the crowd. Their arrival helped the hard-pressed managers to separate the players and temporarily calmed their moods—they had all focused their attentions on their injured teammates. George Wood shed blood for the first time, while Makelele had a concussion.</p>
<p>“This was a very, very intense impact. Both sides did not seem to care about themselves and others. They only had the football in their sights …” The commentator’s tone was not as excited as before. The two people’s current condition was unknown. It would be terrible if something bad were to happen.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Fleming knelt in front of Wood, pried open his hands, and the blood dripped down his cheek onto his clothes.</p>
<p>“The knocked opened a gash …. Does your head hurt?” He asked.</p>
<p>“No.” Wood said in a deep voice like he was gnashing his teeth.</p>
<p>Right next to him, Chelsea’s team doctor laid in front of Makelele and extended three fingers as he shouted, “Claude, how many fingers am I holding up? How many?”</p>
<p>“Three …” Makelele’s faint voice reached George Wood’s ears too. He did not care that Fleming was examining himself as he turned his head to look over. Chelsea’s team doctor was slowly turning his body over to let him lie flat. In the process of turning over, Makelele saw George Wood, and the two men met gazes. Makelele murmured something and closed his eyes to rest. George Wood did not hear clearly.</p>
<p>“He said: ‘Man, your head is so hard.’” Ribéry crouched down and peered closely at the bleeding corner of George Wood’s eye. He asked, “How are you feeling, George?”</p>
<p>“No feeling.”</p>
<p>“Your head is really hard!” Ribéry curled his lips.</p>
<p>“All right, Franck, don’t get in the way of our work here!” Fleming pushed Ribéry away.</p>
<p>“I’m just showing a bit of concern to our superman captain.” Ribéry gave a shrug and opened his arms as he shouted to the other teammates, “Well, he’s okay. Our captain is a total monster!”</p>
<p>“Whoo-hoo—”</p>
<p>The little monkey Bale smiled.</p>
<p>Things were simpler with Makelele’s side. After lying flat on the ground for a while, Makelele recovered from the dizziness after the impact. He no longer spoke nor acted feebly. He sat up slowly and stood up again. He won a standing ovation and cheers from the Chelsea fans in the stands.</p>
<p>“Makelele! Our tough guy!!”</p>
<p>“Claude, you’re the best!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When he saw the cheers that Makelele received once he got up, George Wood also suddenly stood up from the ground which startled Fleming, who was examining him.</p>
<p>“Hey, George! What are you doing?!”</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>“It’s not up to you to say whether you’re ok or now. I’m in charge.”</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other.</p>
<p>“Does your head really not hurt?” Fleming asked.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt.”</p>
<p>“Any dizziness?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Fleming extended a finger and checked, “How many fingers are there?”</p>
<p>“One.”</p>
<p>“One plus one equals to how many?”</p>
<p>“Two.”</p>
<p>“Two times two equals to?”</p>
<p>“Four.”</p>
<p>“Where are you now?”</p>
<p>“In the Champions League finals.”</p>
<p>“Well, Ribéry is right. Your head is really hard. But you still have to be brought off the field to stop the bleeding, change your jersey, and … stitch up the wound.”</p>
<p>Eight volunteers, who were supposed to carry the stretcher, resentfully ran back with the stretcher.</p>
<p>Makelele continued to stay on the pitch after a detailed examination by the team doctor, whereas George Wood came off the field to receive further treatment in the company of Fleming.</p>
<p>Behind him, the referee had not forgotten to show him a yellow card for the foul. His move had “won” him the boos from tens of thousands of Nottingham Forest fans. Following which, he “won” the boos of the other half of the people—for he showed a yellow card to Malouda, who had pushed Ribéry during the conflict.</p>
<p>After inflicting punishment on each side, this conflict was over. Chelsea drove a free kick at the penalty spot. George Wood walked to the sidelines and was treated on the spot by the team doctors.</p>
<p>“I won’t give you any anesthetic as it will affect your performance later. The sutured wound will hurt a little, so you just bear with it.” After he cleaned up the blood around the wound, Fleming was ready to stitch up the wound. He added, “Also, don’t blink. If not, I can’t stitch it well.”</p>
<p>Wood obeyed and stood in front of Fleming, with his eyes wide open, as if he was glowering at the gods. He let Fleming’s hands flutter above his own eyes with the needles moving in and out of the corner of his eyes. His rugged and angular face had no expression. He neither slightly frowned due to the pain nor did his eyes flashed with fear. The rain droplets gathered in his brow. The formation of the water droplets appeared as if it was going to drop into his eyes. But he still had to widen his eyes and not blink. He faced the field and looked at the two teams playing now without looking away.</p>
<p>This scene was transmitted onto the large display screen at the stadium and television screens via the television cameras. The Nottingham Forest fans got excited, even though it was Chelsea who was pressing on their team.</p>
<p>They cheered loudly, “Wood Wood! You’re the Forest!”</p>
<p>“Captain, you’re awesome—-!”</p>
<p>“With such a captain, we’re not afraid of anyone!!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>As the team doctor, Fleming was familiar with this kind of emergency treatment on the spot. He had done countless such simple suture surgeries, but he suddenly felt a little trembling in his hands with George Wood standing in front of him. Completely unaware of the cause, he just felt that his right hand pinching the needle was not as steady as before.</p>
<p>After he held his breath with rapt attention to finish the suture and then wiped the remaining blood stains off his face with a towel, Fleming breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“I almost passed out from holding my breath. George, I can’t even feel your breathing. Was I just stitching the wound on a dead man?” He complained.</p>
<p>“Can I go back on the field to play?” Wood did not heed his complaint and counter asked.</p>
<p>“No, you still have to change your clothes.” A clean set of jersey had been delivered next to him.</p>
<p>Wood did not say any more nonsense and swiftly took off the blood-stained jersey—the originally red jersey had dark red patches where there was blood.</p>
<p>“Take off your shorts as well.” Fleming pointed to his shorts, which also had blood stains dropped on it when Wood sat down before.</p>
<p>Wood bent over to take off his trousers. In an instant, his whole body was left naked except for a pair of white briefs.</p>
<p>As his brawny muscles was drenched in rain, he gave off a shiny silver brilliance under the stadium lights. His healthy and beautiful physique was like a renaissance sculpture of David. Even the simple act of bending over to wear his shorts became exceptionally sexy.</p>
<p>This scene probably caused countless of female fans to scream excitedly in front of the television.</p>
<p>“George Wood got changed on the sidelines, which is certain to be an attention-grabbing gossip the day after the game.” Once he saw that the two players were going to be all right, the commentator was in the mood to joke again. “This serious player was so cool just now!”</p>
<p>George Wood, who changed into the new jersey, raised his hand on the sidelines. As soon as the referee beckoned, he rushed back to the field.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Fleming returned to the technical area with his medical bag.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy for such a young kid to have such a steady mental strength.” He looked back at Wood and exclaimed, “His poise actually made me feel a little nervous … It’s embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to be ashamed of, Gary. Only such a person would be eligible to lead my Nottingham Forest team on the field.” Twain answered with a smile next to him.</p>
<p>“He is a lion who never gives up, never fears, and is the king of the Forest.”</p>
<p>Amid the rain, George Wood ran back to the field with his head held up and Ribéry extended his hand along his way. Wood high-fived him as he ran past to return to his position.</p>
<p>In the stands of the Luzhniki stadium, loud applause and cheers erupted. In this tsunami of voices, the sound of the rain was simply insignificant.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 653 - A Dramatic Scene</p>
<p>The stitched area at the corner of his eye was affixed with a piece of tape. It stood out under illumination from the night lights and the scouring of the rain. This made George Wood easily distinguishable on the field.</p>
<p>Even though Wood was injured, it did not affect his play on the field. Instead, it made him fiercer, like the lion king, guarding his pride of lions and turf, which only became more brutal after being hurt and not run away with its tail in between its legs.</p>
<p>He clearly saw the circumstances in which his team was being crushed by Chelsea on the field when he came off for his treatment. Without his tireless running in the midfield and his fierce and precise defense, Nottingham Forest was suppressed by Chelsea’s ferocious offensive.</p>
<p>Now he needed to reverse this incorrect situation.</p>
<p>Consequently, he strove harder than he did before he got hurt.</p>
<p>When he came on, the situation changed immediately. Chelsea could not pass through the midfield without any qualms. Their offense was met by the tenacious obstruction by George Wood and the others which made it difficult to advance even by a fraction.</p>
<p>With George Wood’s participation, Nottingham Forest slowly took back the initiative in the game.</p>
<p>Makelele still looked like he had not recovered. More often than not, he stayed behind and did auxiliary work, during which the defense in the midfield was shared by several other people.</p>
<p>See the contrast of this scene, some people could not help but exclaimed at George Wood’s otherworldly physical quality.</p>
<p>“He is a treasure that any manager has always dreamed of. An outstanding body, strict adherence to the tactical discipline, good psychological quality, stable state, utter loyalty… and he does not get hurt! The mover whom that Tony Twain picked up from the streets made all managers in the world green with envy. With him around, Nottingham Forest’s good results are not surprising at all!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest, which recaptured the initiative in the game, began to spur on more threatening attacks. The game had been played for twenty-five minutes now and there were few threatening attacks from both sides. The number of threatening shots were even fewer. Chelsea took advantage of when George Wood was treated off the field and launched an attack. While Nottingham Forest did not even have one yet—if Bale’s pass which went crooked was not counted that one time.</p>
<p>Both sides vied with each other in the midfield most of the time.</p>
<p>In one go, Chelsea’s lineup deployed four players who could be the defensive midfielder—Lampard, Ballack, Makelele and Essien. Although Essien was the guest right back, sometimes he could rush to the midfield to defend. Makelele’s ability was never in doubt and Ballack and Lampard were tough midfielders. They could seriously execute the tactics when they were needed to defend.</p>
<p>And on this side of Nottingham Forest, George Wood alone covered almost the latter half of the midfield, with the addition of the actively running players like Ribéry and Lennon. Both sides were equally matched in the midfield and inextricably locked in battle.</p>
<p>In the twenty-seventh minute, Lennon forcibly broke through Ashley Cole in the wing but the football under his feet was shoveled out of the sidelines by Cole. Nottingham Forest was awarded an out-of-bounds ball.</p>
<p>As an out-of-bounds ball could not be offside, Lennon almost moved to the end line to catch the ball, while Ashley Cole also had to follow him to move near the end line to prevent the Forest team from hitting directly behind him again. Joe Cole blocked in front of Rafinha, who was in charge of throwing the ball, to interfere with him and not allow him to easily throw the football to his target.</p>
<p>Rafinha was not stupid enough to throw the football at whomever Chelsea kept an eye on. He threw the football directly into van der Vaart in the middle.</p>
<p>After van der Vaart stopped the ball with his chest, Makelele leaned forward. The effects from the collision had gradually dissipated, and his ferocity did not diminish at all.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart, who tried his best to protect the football, gave up his intention to pass a threatening shot after he quickly observed the situation on the field. He passed the football to George Wood, who plugged in from the back. The boss had said that the offense in the game was organized by the captain, so he would hand it over for him to organize.</p>
<p>Wood did not stop the ball but brushed the ball to pass it on. The football drew an arc in the air and turned to the left side of the field.</p>
<p>Gareth Bale had already appeared in that position. As a full back, his assists were frequent and firm.</p>
<p>Once he beautifully took down Wood’s pass, Bale started to pass the ball. Van Nistelrooy attracted the attention of both Terry and Carvalho in the front, but the unguarded Eastwood quickly rushed up and did a powerful diving header!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Čech reacted quickly. Coupled with his well-position stance, he struck out the football the moment he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The football bounced up and out. It flew toward the right side of the goalmouth, which happened to be where van Nistelrooy was with Terry and Carvalho.</p>
<p>The three men huddled together and wanted to head the football. In the end, no one headed the ball.</p>
<p>The football bounced high on the ground as if to laugh at these three entangled fools.</p>
<p>At this time Ribéry appeared out of nowhere like a phantom.</p>
<p>He took down the football and quickly flashed past Terry to immediately start shooting!</p>
<p>The football came out of the cracks between the people, and suddenly appeared in front of Čech, who could not do anything even if he was a god—he was too close, almost within easy reach.</p>
<p>Čech did not even have time to wave before the football swooped down to bypass his side and flew into the goal behind him!</p>
<p>“The ball went in—”</p>
<p>A sound of “bang” was heard and the red squares in the stands of Luzhniki Stadium erupted with huge cheers.</p>
<p>“This is Nottingham Forest’s second shot in this game, and it pierced through the gate guarded by Čech!”</p>
<p>It must be said that Čech here was not the Čech with the tank helmet in Twain’s impression. Today’s Čech had not suffered that serious injury, and his state was not badly affected. He remained as one of the top three goalkeepers in the world.</p>
<p>“The defending champion leads with one goal in the Champions League final!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The Nottingham Forest players wildly embraced together and celebrated the goal on the field.</p>
<p>Off the field, Tony Twain brandished his fists hard and gnashed his teeth as he celebrated the goal.</p>
<p>Not far next to him, Grant slammed hard at the top of awning in the technical area behind him. The problem still laid with the wings.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“This is Franck Ribéry’s sixth goal in the Champions League, only one goal away from Cristiano Ronaldo’s seven goals! Last year’s European Footballer of the Year had maintained a very high level of competitive state this year. If he could help the team win the UEFA Champions League again, then this year’s FIFA World Player of the Year may not be in any dispute!”</p>
<p>Ribéry finally broke free from his teammates’ hugs. He waved his fists hard and faced the Forest fans in the stands. Like a band conductor, every time he waved, the fans in the stands followed suit and turned up the volume to loudly call out his name.</p>
<p>“Ribéry! Ribéry! Ribé–ry!!”</p>
<p>After rousing the fans’ passions, Ribéry turned and ran back. When he passed by George Wood, he reached out to wood, and the two men high-fived each other again.</p>
<p>Twain, who celebrated the goal off the field, stood on the sidelines, cupped his hands up around his mouth and shouted toward the field, “Keep up the pressure, don’t relax! Continue to press and attack!”</p>
<p>Using offense to suppress the opponent, Nottingham Forest did not plan to be too conservative in this final.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s style of playing football was previously criticized as conservative and passive during last year’s Champions League final. Even when they took the title, they were thought to have won by depending on defensive counterattack. This year, Twain wanted to take a title that would leave all the critics dumbfounded—to be the first defending champion since the restructuring of the Champions League, and that no one could find fault with the way they picked up the trophy!</p>
<p>Chelsea looked frustrated by this goal concede because the opponent breached the goal guarded by Čech’s with only two shots. Any goal concede in a game like the Champions League final could cause upheavals in the players’ mind.</p>
<p>Grant stood in silence on the sidelines like a statue. Who knew what was going on in his mind?</p>
<p>At this time, it was his assistant manager, Clarke, who walked up to the sidelines and loudly reminded the players on the field to focus and not let the Forest team take advantage to attack again.</p>
<p>A minute later, Drogba did a return pass after he caught the ball in the box. Ballack followed up with an angry shot, showing Chelsea’s determination not to accept this result. Unfortunately, the corner shot flew straight toward the grandstand.</p>
<p>Grant finally came back from his contemplation. He whistled and gestured, demanding that the team stepped up the offense and temporarily pressed back on the opponent’s offense, while they dialed up the scramble in the midfield and not let George Wood easily pass the ball out when their defense turned into offense.</p>
<p>After thirty minutes, various wonderful scenes emerged in succession.</p>
<p>Lampard sent a long pass to Drogba. Drogba ferried to the back, while Piqué almost did an own goal under Ballack’s tight interference. The football hit the goalpost and fell outside of the end line which startled all the Nottingham Forest people who broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>Chelsea seized this corner shot and tried to break Nottingham Forest’s goal. Terry and Carvalho rushed to the front of the Forest team’s goal.</p>
<p>But after the corner kick was sent out, Eastwood, who had to return to defend, was cut off. While Chelsea’s defenders were not back yet, he dribbled the ball to the midfield and sent a long pass across. He passed the football to Ribéry, who followed closely on the wing.</p>
<p>After Ribéry took down the football, he lifted his leg to pass.</p>
<p>The football drew an arc in the air and bypassed Essien on the passing route. Van Nistelrooy got the upper hand in the contest against Makelele and jumped high to send a powerful header shot!</p>
<p>This time Čech did not let the football get past his fingertips. He strove to pounce the ball out.</p>
<p>The football was hastily sent out by Ashley Cole who rushed back. But he did not kick it far. The ball only flew to the top of the arc before it was intercepted by another Nottingham Forest player.</p>
<p>“Aaron Lennon!”</p>
<p>Lennon had observed that Čech had just gotten up and his center of gravity had not stabilized yet, so he did not hesitate to directly kick a long shot!</p>
<p>The football flew straight toward the right side of the goalpost. Čech had just gotten up, but he still managed to make a high-quality save. He threw himself out and leaped to use his fingertips to swipe the football out of the end line!</p>
<p>“A fantastic save from Čech!! What an incredible save! He proved his strength to safeguard the goal!”</p>
<p>At this time, Terry, who ran back, hugged Čech, who had just climbed up from the ground. He patted him hard the back and thanked him for those two crucial saves.</p>
<p>“If Nottingham Forest were to score another goal, this final would be hard for Chelsea to play on. The morale of Nottingham Forest during this time has been quite strong, and the situation has been very favorable to them. The trailing Chelsea team has to press out to figure out how to score. Nottingham Forest, which is good at defensive counterattack, has more room to play at this point in time. Look at this counterattack, it could almost be written into a textbook!”</p>
<p>This counterattack was almost the epitome of the entire first half. Chelsea tried its hardest to equalize, but Nottingham Forest’s solid defense and sharp counterattack constrained them. They were unable to do their best, and their offensive effect was greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Instead, Nottingham Forest was completely in control of the pace on the field, leading Chelsea by the nose to run.</p>
<p>The neutral commentators certainly did not want to watch a one-sided game, but they must also admit that this was Nottingham Forest embodying the spirit of a defending champion. “They are steady and not flustered, as if everything is in their control. By comparison, Chelsea, which lacks the experience of playing in the Champions League finals, is more tender. Tony Twain has injected his own spirit into this team, giving this team a unique soul, and this soul is—they desire any title, any victory.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>It looked like the first half of the game would end with Nottingham Forest dominating, and Chelsea’s offense was of no threat to the Forest team.</p>
<p>At the forty-second minute, Ribéry broke into the penalty area from the flank and then passed a low ball. Van Nistelrooy apparently did not expect Ribéry to choose to pass after his breakthrough, rather than directly shoot. His follow-up was a little slow. Even though he used a technique of shoveling, he still did not touch the football. The football crossed past the goalmouth amid the Chelsea fans’ exclamations.</p>
<p>Twain was annoyed that this goal was not scored. He jumped off the field as he held his head in his hands. If we can score two goals, then Chelsea will be out of the game. That was what he thought.</p>
<p>Judging from the first half, Nottingham Forest fully deserved to win the title. Chelsea simply could not pose any threat to Edwin van der Sar’s goal. If Chelsea won instead, then it would be a real injustice.</p>
<p>A minute later, Lampard dribbled the ball and charged into Nottingham Forest’s thirty-meter zone where he was put to the ground by George Wood. Referee Micheľ awarded Chelsea a direct free kick that elicited a small protest from the Nottingham Forest players and boos from the Forest fans. As this position was too dangerous and about twenty-five meters from the goal, it was a very suitable range. Lampard and Ballack both had a free kick foundation.</p>
<p>The entire Chelsea team got excited. This was a great opportunity for them to equalize. As the first half was coming to an end, they definitely could not go into the locker room while they trailed behind in the score!</p>
<p>Ballack stood in front of the football. He was going to take this free kick.</p>
<p>The Nottingham Forest players lined up in a human wall of five people under the command of the goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar, while everyone got ready to face the opponent.</p>
<p>After a whistle, Ballack kicked the ball high.</p>
<p>“Judging from the first half, Ballack’s form is really underwhelming …” The commentator sighed.</p>
<p>Twain clapped his hands and laughed off the field.</p>
<p>After they had gotten a hard to come by chance, the whole team’s hopes were pinned on one person, only for that person to kick the opportunity away. This was really an essential recipe to strike a blow to the morale…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain got up from his seat and saw that the first half of the game was coming to an end. He began to think about what he was going to do at the halftime interval in his head. Did the tactic need to be adjusted? And how should their mentality be maintained?</p>
<p>At the side, the fourth official came forward with an electronic display board and raised it high. There were four minutes of injury stoppage time in the first half!</p>
<p>Due to the collision between George Wood and Makelele as well as the clash between the players on both sides, the injury stoppage time in the first half was more than three minutes. This somewhat caused resentment among the Nottingham Forest fans. Most people had chosen to use boos to express their views on the incident.</p>
<p>The Chelsea people were overjoyed. This was their last chance in the first half. If they were to go to the locker room with a trailing score, it would be a heavy blow to the morale of the team.</p>
<p>In the forty-sixth minute, Essien, who had been active as the full back, embodied his comprehensive side. After he received Makelele’s pass, he suddenly dribbled the ball to plug in ahead and sped through the midfield to directly press on toward George Wood’s defensive line.</p>
<p>George Wood certainly could not tolerate the opponent to be rash under his watch. He pounced to try to stop Essien’s continued breakthrough.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Essien directly did a long shot!</p>
<p>A long shot was almost the only way Chelsea could threaten the Nottingham Forest goal in the first half. Drogba was firmly clamped down by Piqué and Pepe in the first half, with no room for play at all. He even disappeared at one point. So, whenever Chelsea attacked, the players who most often appeared in the television close-up were Lampard, Ballack, Essien, Joe Cole… and other good long shot players, whereas Drogba could only be a tactical center forward responsible for attracting Nottingham Forest’s defensive firepower.</p>
<p>Seeing Essien’s long shot, Piqué threw aside Drogba and threw his body to block the long-shot route, hoping for a bit of luck that the football could be blocked out by him.</p>
<p>But this time, things were a little different …</p>
<p>Essien’s shot did hit Piqué’s body, but the ball was not directly blocked out. Instead, it changed direction and rebounded in the opposite direction where Edwin van der Sar had pounced to. When he saw that the shot was going to fly into the goal just like this, Pepe extended his legs to block. The football hit him on the knee and deflected again. It did not bounce to Edwin van der Sar’s side, but fell directly in an unattended area!</p>
<p>The penalty area was only so big but after the football refracted twice, was it a coincidence that the football had found a drop point that had no one at all?</p>
<p>What was more coincidentally …</p>
<p>“Frank Lampard—–” The commentator roared with excitement.</p>
<p>Along with his roar, the Chelsea fans as well as the Chelsea manager, Grant, also sprang from their seats.</p>
<p>Without anyone to mark him at all and the goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar also lost his balance to fall to the ground, such an opportunity … such an opportunity …</p>
<p>Lampard stared at the football leaping in front of his eyes as if there was a blazing flame burning in his eyes.</p>
<p>How can I let go of such an opportunity!!</p>
<p>“Lampard draws his leg back for a vigorous shot–!”</p>
<p>“What a powerful shot—-GOOOOAL!!”</p>
<p>“Frank Lampard!!” All the Chelsea fans at the stadium roared loudly.</p>
<p>“He did it! This is the first goal that Chelsea has scored in a Champions League final in its club history! From their steely midfielder, Frank Lampard! He had just lost his mother not long ago… With such a goal, surely he can comfort his mother in the heaven?”</p>
<p>Lampard’s face did not have the expression of excitement in creating history after the goal. He pointed his hands to the sky, lifted his head, and let the cold rain hit his face. The water droplets slid down his cheeks from the corners of his eyes. Was it rain or tears?</p>
<p>The rain was cold, but the tears were hot.</p>
<p>Did you create such an opportunity for me, mom?</p>
<p>His Blues teammates rushed up to hold the tearful Lampard and pointed to the sky with him. All the Chelsea players had black armbands fastened to their left arms. As teammates of a team, they mourned Lampard’s mother together with him in this way.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the face of such a goal concede, everyone at Nottingham Forest could not even get angry. On the one hand, this goal was really bizarre. Who could have thought that after the two refractions, the ball would fall into a dead corner completely without the Forest team defenders? What was even more bizarre was that Lampard appeared in this dead corner! Did anyone see where he was before?</p>
<p>Twain stood dumbly in front of the technical area. All the adjustments he had just thought about just now were all invalidated in that second. The rain was getting heavier. What did it mean to have “his plans rained on?” This was what “being rained on” meant!</p>
<p>Turning his head, he looked at Kerslake and Dunn with their equally surprised faces and helplessly shook his head, “This is football. Lampard is really good, we …” He wriggled his lips, but he did not burst out with a string of obscenities. He just said, “…. are just damn unlucky.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 654 - I Won’t Agree</p>
<p>In the locker room during the halftime interval, the Nottingham Forest players were a bit dejected. No one could accept the result of their opponent’s equalizer towards the end of the first half.</p>
<p>“All right, don’t think about that goal concede. That’s can’t be helped anymore …” Twain was comforting them, “Instead of feeling frustrated here about the first half that’s already over, think about how we still hit back in the second half!” He clenched and waved his fist in front of everyone.</p>
<p>“We basically took control of the initiative in the first half and the pace of the game was in our hands. That goal of Lampard … It was a real accident. There will always be accidents like this on the football field. But I want you to minimize the probability of this kind of accident happening in the second half. If you look at the source of that goal concede, it wasn’t an accident. Essien’s sudden plug-in prevented us from reacting and let him run all the way to the front of our box for a long shot—you all thought he would cross, or divert the football to someone else, right?”</p>
<p>“For ten minutes after the second half starts, you can slow down the pace a little and adjust. Focus on defense during this period and save your physical strength. Wait until the last twenty minutes to start powering up again.”</p>
<p>Twain was aware that it was tiring to keep the same pace in a major game like this, because the mental stress draining the players’ energies was also not to be underestimated, on top of their physical exertion using up their energies. Nottingham Forest had the upper hand in the first half and repeatedly launched a threatening offensive. They had more ball possession than Chelsea, at the cost of a lot of physical exertion, especially on the two sides. If they continued to play like this in the second half, their stamina could collapse before the ninety minutes game was over.</p>
<p>They needed to adjust the tempo when necessary, slow down the pace of the offensive, and properly let the opponent move out to attack. Besides being able to restore their fitness, it would also create chances for them to counterattack. When it came to counterattacks, Twain did not think there was a team in the world which could do it better than Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>“The morale of Chelsea after the equalizer must have been strong and they will launch a fierce offensive against our goal at the start of the second half. At that time, don’t rush to press out and deal with them. Pepe and Piqué, continue to make sure that you suppress Drogba … You guys did a great job in the first half, so much so that I even thought Drogba was not playing in this game.” He spread his hands and made a joke.</p>
<p>This remark amused everyone, and the atmosphere lightened slightly.</p>
<p>“So, that’s it, defense.” Twain once again threw out his own “theory of defense above all else.””Prevent the opponent’s attack can enhance our morale on the one hand while on the other hand, it can hit the opponent’s morale hard. Football games are the process of long elimination. If you can withstand their ferocious attack at the beginning of the second half, then the victory of this game basically belongs to us!” He clenched his fist as if he had grabbed hold of the championship trophy.</p>
<p>“Then we will attack. You can’t forget to fight back while you’re defending, and you can’t forget to defend when you attack. That’s what I’m asking of you in our usual training. I want you to be able to show me this in this game. After you withstand the onslaught from Chelsea, they are bound to feel discouraged by it and will be at a low ebb in terms of stamina. At that time … you know what to do, don’t you?”</p>
<p>The players laughed and replied, “Of course!”</p>
<p>“Lastly, I hope you don’t lose your desire for the title and your confidence in winning no matter what happens. This is more important than any tactic. Chelsea is sure to counter, so let them come! We’re not afraid! The crazier they counter, the closer we are to the championship title!!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Chelsea’s locker room. Grant was giving the players the tactical rundown for the second half with a calm expression. He did not act in a manner like how Tony Twain inspired his players in the locker room with exaggerated body movements and sonorous powerful words. He was really not good at that kind of work …</p>
<p>“… The offensive has to be stepped up in the second half. Our offense was terrible in the first half!” In the past in the locker room, Grant would always deliberate his remarks to avoid provoking those big-name star players and creating antagonism between the players and coaches in the locker room. But he could not care about that this time. The rumors that he would be dismissed even if he won the Champions League title were already swirling all over. His days at Stamford Bridge had already entered a countdown, and he also did not want to stay at Chelsea to coach. His current greatest wish was to beautifully win the trophy in Moscow and give a hard slap back to the faces of the media and busybodies. Then he would take the penalty fees for the breach of the contract given by Abramovich and turned to walk away.</p>
<p>“Drogba, you’re completely restricted by the opponent’s two tall center backs. Do you have a way to get rid of them?”</p>
<p>Drogba still gasped for his breath and did not want to deal with this replacement manager who robbed his mentor’s job. He just lowered his head and answered with a “um” to indicate that he was fine.</p>
<p>Grant looked at this player who gave him a headache. Everyone knew that in the previous media reports circulated about him, this black player was among the people in the locker room who opposed and questioned him. But he was Chelsea’s striker best at scoring goals…</p>
<p>“… If you can’t, I’ll bring you off.” Grant had a grim expression as he said those harsh words.</p>
<p>Drogba drew back the corners of his mouth and did not say anything about it.</p>
<p>But the other players in the locker room looked differently at Grant. They were astonished. When did the manager, who had always acted a little cowardly in the face of the big-name star players, started to be tough? In fact, Grant’s position in the players’ mind was not high. Even if he had led the team to the Champions League final, there were still many people who thought that he was a coward. They could not be blamed because after all, Grant’s predecessor was so brilliant … Anyone who came could only live in the shadow of that arrogant madman manager.</p>
<p>Grant found himself in trouble. His players seemed a little distracted. It was strange that their morale was still strong after the equalizer. So why did they behaved less than enthusiastically during the halftime interval? Was it because the pressure was too high? Or could it be some other reason?</p>
<p>He knew there had been some factional fighting in the locker room. There had been contradictions between the players, conflicts between the players and the coaches, and even disagreements between the coaches themselves … With so many contradictions, Chelsea still broke into the final in the end. He felt he was quite remarkable as a manager.</p>
<p>But to fall short through lack of a final effort, it definitely was not something Grant could accept.</p>
<p>He stopped his rundown of the tactics. Since they were not listening, there was no point in continuing.</p>
<p>“What are you all thinking about?” He asked aloud, “We equalized the score. But why do I feel you’re not happy at all now?”</p>
<p>No one answered his question. He was nominally the manager of this team, but in the locker room, his authority might not be as strong as that of the native England star player like Lampard.</p>
<p>“Where do you think you are at this moment?!” Grant was somewhat angry and could not help but raise his voice, “It is now the halftime in the Champions League final! There’s still forty-five minutes left before the game will be over! And you’re still here getting distracted? Whether we can get the title, it’s all down to these last forty-five minutes. I’m explaining the tactics, but why doesn’t anyone listen?!”</p>
<p>He slammed the tactical board. His actions and tone which completely went against his normal behavior made everyone look up.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to win this title, do you? The club has never played in a Champions League final in its history. Now that you’ve done it, you want to stop here, is that it?” His volume was still rising, “Are you guys satisfied to score just one goal in the Champions League final? Are you happy with the equalizer? But I won’t agree!! Those fans out there won’t agree either!!” The furious Grant shook off his suit jacket as he growled and pointed at the door. It shocked everyone.</p>
<p>Lampard finally came forward. He was more supportive of Grant. “I’m sorry, boss. None of us here wants to give up the game.” He turned and indicated his teammates behind him. Some people followed up with their nods.</p>
<p>“Yes, we all want to beat Nottingham Forest and win the championship.” The captain, Terry also declared the team’s position. Well, now the problem was solved.</p>
<p>“Then listen carefully!” When he saw Lampard stand up and recalled what he had just gone through, Grant’s tone eased a little. He picked up his suit jacket and tossed it aside. He began to explain to the players the tactics to be used in the second half.</p>
<p>At the same time, he was shocked in his mind that he had lost himself in that moment just now. He became like that huckster, Tony Twain and used words to criticize and provoke the players.</p>
<p>But… it felt pretty good just now.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Chelsea is certain to make some adjustments, not necessarily among the players. The biggest possibility is tactical. But… I wouldn’t be surprised if Grant, that old man, replaces Drogba. The only one who is surprised should be Drogba.” Sitting in the technical area, Twain said to the people around him with a smile. The second half of the game was about to begin, and he was still relaxed enough to joke with his assistant managers.</p>
<p>It was strange that he did not have such a mentality when they played against AC Milan. Even when he played against Mourinho’s Chelsea, he did not dare to relax much. However, when he played against Grant, he always had the feeling that “everything is in the palm of my hands.”</p>
<p>He had never regarded this old Israeli man as a true opponent in his mind …</p>
<p>The two sides changed sides to compete again in the second half. Neither team made any changes in the players. They only fine-tuned their tactics. Nottingham Forest placed more emphasis on defense, while Chelsea used the advantage of their kickoff in the second half to launch a series of offensives against the Forest team’s goal.</p>
<p>In the fifty-fifth minute, Essien once again charged into Nottingham Forest’s hinterland from his full back position. After he swung past Ribéry, he raised his leg to shoot and the shot went slightly above the crossbar.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, Drogba received a corner shot from the left. He jumped high to attack with a header shot, but unfortunately, it hit high again.</p>
<p>Shortly ten seconds later, Ballack suddenly dribbled the ball to break out from the midfield and kicked a long shot. The football deflected out from the right column.</p>
<p>During this time, Chelsea’s offense completely suppressed Nottingham Forest. The Forest team gradually declined in the confrontation in the midfield. It was not to say that Chelsea’s midfield was stronger, but Grant had instructed the midfielders to increase the intensity of the confrontation and strengthened the whole midfield because George Wood was also a tough midfielder. If they still remained soft as an opponent, then it would be no surprise to lose the midfield.</p>
<p>The basis to decide the victory in the game was in the midfield. By gaining the midfield, Chelsea had the hope of completing the reversal.</p>
<p>Once the three men, Ballack, Lampard and Makelele toughened up, Chelsea’s situation on the field immediately changed. No matter how strong George Wood was, he could not confront three people alone.</p>
<p>Pepe, Piqué and the others made many crucial rescues in the face of Chelsea’s waves of offensive. In addition, due to the pressure from Chelsea which caused the Nottingham Forest formation to be compressed backward, George Wood was more like a center back than a defensive midfielder at this time. Even van Nistelrooy came back to take part in the defense, leaving only Eastwood alone in front—he was placed there to be ready to fight back. But for now, the Forest team had no chance of fighting back at all.</p>
<p>Grant understood Tony Twain’s team. They were the kind of team which he could not take lightly and needed to keep an eye and defend, even when they were besieging them. Therefore, when he instructed his team to besiege Nottingham Forest and launch a counter press in the midfield and in front, they must never give them a chance to fight back.</p>
<p>In the sixty-sixth minute, Chelsea once again forcibly obtained a corner kick through a series bombardment. Lampard launched the corner shot. The successive attacks put a mental strain on Edwin van der Sar. Instead of waiting for the defenders to lift a siege, he intended to strike on his own and take the ball to completely end this round of Chelsea’s offensive.</p>
<p>But–</p>
<p>“He missed the target!!” The commentator exclaimed.</p>
<p>Edwin van der Sar chose to strike which was really a little risky. There were three players in the middle. When he struck, he could not even directly get the football. At best, he could only get the ball out. That was what van der Sar realized in mid-air, so he tried to quickly change his strategy which immediately resulted in him missing his target…</p>
<p>The football skirted past the front of his fists!</p>
<p>At this point, the Nottingham Forest people was so startled that theirs heart leapt to their throats, because Chelsea’s captain, John Terry was next to Edwin van der Sar.</p>
<p>This center back was brilliant at header shots …</p>
<p>Perhaps he was dazzled by Edwin van der Sar’s attack. When the shining white football suddenly flew in front of him, Terry had not reacted yet. He hurriedly swung his head but ended up the same as Edwin van der Sar—he missed!</p>
<p>“Gasp—-” This time, whether it was a Nottingham Forest fan or a Chelsea fan, everyone gasped.</p>
<p>The football was not rubbed against by anyone. It glided through the penalty area of Nottingham Forest at a high speed and then flew straight out of the sidelines on the other side.</p>
<p>“Nottingham Forest narrowly escaped! And John Terry will surely be annoyed at why he did not get to that ball! They had a chance to lead ahead of Nottingham Forest!”</p>
<p>This ball startled Twain till he jumped from his seat and almost covered his head in his hands with chagrin. Fortunately, Terry was addled at the last minute, and did not head the ball under freakish circumstances.</p>
<p>On the other side, Grant jumped out of his seat too. But he was excited and annoyed—-at first it was because he was excited, and then he jumped again due to chagrin this time.</p>
<p>“Chelsea missed a good opportunity. Maybe they’ll regret it after the game. But now that Chelsea has the upper hand on the field, they can still create more opportunities. Surely Chelsea’s powerful offensive group will be able to seize a chance at some point, won’t they?”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Chelsea to seize the opportunity, Nottingham Forest’s own defensive line first collapsed in a corner.</p>
<p>Piqué fell to the ground and did not get up after a fierce scramble. He rolled on the ground as he held his calf in his hands. He had a muscle cramp.</p>
<p>The team doctor, Fleming was summoned once again and ran up. George Wood had already pressed Piqué’s leg down as an emergency treatment.</p>
<p>“Chelsea has put a lot of pressure on us …” Kerslake muttered.</p>
<p>The pressure was really very high during this time. The defenders was busy till dizzy in the heads with the constant siege. As a center back, Piqué not only had to fill in Bale’s position, but also had to return to the middle and defend against Drogba. He also had to scramble for Chelsea’s passes in the wing, and block Chelsea’s frenzied long shots with his body …</p>
<p>“Is it time to make adjustments?” Dunn saw Twain get up and asked.</p>
<p>Twain nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s a little earlier than expected. But the plan would not have kept pace with the change. What’s important is the command on the scene.” Twain walked to the sidelines. He called George Wood and van der Vaart.</p>
<p>“Press out, don’t shrink in the back. George, you’re the defensive midfielder, not the center back. What are you doing running into the box? Rafael, we need to rely on your personal skills here to get the football out. You can rest assured that George will protect you in the back. If you encounter interception, pass the ball, quickly pass and go to cut ahead!” Twain made a gesture and continued, “Don’t tangle ceaselessly with them in the midfield and be deceived by Chelsea. Use the fastest speed to pass through the midfield. Directly threaten their goal and show them what you’ve got. That will keep them in check! When there’s a chance for a long shot, take the long shot. It’s not necessarily to pursue the success rate of the attack. Under such circumstances, one or two threatening shots will be enough to turn things around!”</p>
<p>As he spoke hurriedly, the two men nodded simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Well, go up and tell the others what I said, and let them carry it out.”</p>
<p>Once he patted the pair on the shoulders and sent them back to the field, Twain did not walk back to the technical area. He continued to stand on the sidelines and watched the pitch. The situation was becoming critical, and he was unable to stay calm.</p>
<p>He turned his head and glanced sideways at Grant, who was also standing on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Chelsea’s play during this time made him feel stressed and sense danger. He could no longer joke to deal with this game and such an opponent like he did at the start of the second half.</p>
<p>Did it look like he was going to have to change his view of Grant?</p>
<p>Could there be some minor waves of changes in this game?</p>
<p>How big a wave do you want to set off, Mr. Grant?</p>
<p>Want to get the title? I won’t agree.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 655 - A Stalemate</p>
<p>“Eastwood shot directly from the tip of the arc in the box! Ah, but the Chelsea defender, Carvalho used his body to block it out of the end line. This was Nottingham Forest’s first shot in the second half! They were previously pushed back by Chelsea in their own half and basically couldn’t get out.”</p>
<p>That sounded a little miserable, but the actual situation was really like that.</p>
<p>After Twain adjusted the tactics in the midfield, Nottingham Forest’s offense finally picked up and Eastwood’s shot was an opportunity found through a quick pass in the midfield.</p>
<p>Chelsea made tough arrangements in the midfield, but Twain did not meet them force with force. He used faster passes and positional play to shake off Chelsea’s defense.</p>
<p>Next, the game entered an impasse. Both sides had opportunities, but neither could directly threaten each other’s goal.</p>
<p>In the seventy-fourth minute, Ribéry again relied on his personal skills to force a breakthrough past the Chelsea’s defensive line in the flank. Then he launched a shot at a narrow angle, but it hit the side of the net. This annoyed Ribéry. Although he had already scored a goal, his pursuit of the goal was never going to stop.</p>
<p>Following which Chelsea launched an attack and Malouda stopped the ball with his chest after he received Lampard’s pass. But during a scramble with George Wood, he fell to the ground which happened to be inside the box. The Chelsea players held their hands high and the Chelsea fans booed in the hope that the referee would see this scene in order to blow his whistle for a penalty to Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>The referee’s whistle rang, but he did not blow it because George Wood had fouled. Instead, he blew it for Malouda had fouled with a handball first!</p>
<p>This penalty caused Malouda who had just fallen to the ground and raised his hands to signal his innocence, to jump up right away. He waved his arms angrily and complained endlessly. It would not be an overstatement to describe that he flew into a rage.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Grant also jumped up from his seat and angrily objected off the field. At first it was because the referee did not rule that George Wood had fouled, and then he was angry with Malouda—you bloody idiot, did you forget that you already have a yellow card on you? To go up against the referee time, do you want to apply for a red card and be sent off?!</p>
<p>It was Lampard who kept a cool head. He went up and pulled Malouda away, repeatedly reminding him of his yellow card.</p>
<p>Malouda then stopped and ran back with Lampard. The referee did not plan to pull out the cards, which let the other Chelsea players secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The game went on for seventy-six minutes and Drogba basically did not get a decent chance. His physical fitness in the Premier League football was famous, but he met a difficult opponent today—the two players, Pepe and Piqué were by his side at all times and firmly wedged him, so that he did not have the opportunity to take the ball. Even if he got the ball, he could not turn around and even if he managed to turn around, he also did not have a chance to shoot.</p>
<p>As Chelsea’s center forward, how could he not be enraged inside when his performance for the first time in the Champions League final was so lame?</p>
<p>Plus, the harsh words that Grant threw down during the halftime interval made him desperately want to prove himself with a goal.</p>
<p>I must find a way to change this situation!</p>
<p>He pulled out and no longer blindly remained in the innermost area, which made it more convenient for him to take the ball.</p>
<p>Pepe and Piqué saw Drogba take the initiative to pull out of the box but did not follow. They did not need to take care of Drogba, who did not have the ball. It was only when the football reached Drogba’s feet that the two players would pounce over.</p>
<p>When Drogba pulled out, he raised his arm to signal to his teammates to pass the ball to him. He wanted to properly vent the frustration of being frozen during this time.</p>
<p>Joe Cole’s personal skills on the left wing attracted the two players, Lennon and Rafinha. He took the opportunity to horizontally pass the ball to the front of the box.</p>
<p>Drogba caught the ball.</p>
<p>He did not stop the football very well and it bounced a little. But this also gave Drogba a chance to shoot. He did not have to think about how to get rid of the difficult defense. Now he only needed to … just swing his leg!</p>
<p>“The Beast” Drogba swung his stout thigh and relied on his lower back and core to rotate his body to volley on the spot!</p>
<p>No one would underestimate the strength of this center forward. He was already famous when he was still in Marseille. But it was in Chelsea that Mourinho made him a true world-class striker. Everyone could still remember when he caught the ball outside the box at that time and immediately turned his body to volley a world-class ball that broke through Barcelona’s goal. For such a player, he could not be underestimated even if he was away from the goal!</p>
<p>Pepe took the lead to rush up in hopes to fend off the football with his body. But the football whizzed past him.</p>
<p>The football went through the box and flew straight to the right of the goal.</p>
<p>Edwin van der Sar tried his best to pounce out. His whole body flew out sideways and his outstretched arms tried to throw out the football. He did not get what he wanted as well.</p>
<p>The football skimmed in front of his fingertips.</p>
<p>At this moment, it was believed that the hearts of all Nottingham Forest players and fans turned cold. At the same time, the Chelsea fans were already eagerly holding their arms high and ready to announce their lead.</p>
<p>“Clang!”</p>
<p>With a loud sound, the Nottingham Forest fans’ wits returned while the Chelsea fans lost their wits.</p>
<p>The football struck the outside of the goalpost and flew straight out of the end line!</p>
<p>“Ah—” The commentator cried loudly, as if he was sorrier than Drogba himself. “It actually hit the post! Chelsea had no such luck! Drogba’s luck is so terrible!”</p>
<p>This kick startled Twain till he jumped from his seat. In that moment, he acted like there was a fire on his buttocks.</p>
<p>“F**k!” He swore.</p>
<p>The Chelsea players played as if they literally took medicine as a team in the second half and were so energized. Their every shot was threatening. How else could the Forest team play this game? If this continued on, even if they counterattacked, the Forest team would collapse sooner or later.</p>
<p>This kind of shot which hit the post, was simply a mental torment to the Nottingham Forest players. Did they feel a little soft in their legs after they had survived that shot?</p>
<p>The game against AC Milan for the title had not been this tense. It was really more difficult as the defending champion…</p>
<p>You’re attacked on all sides like you are a gigantic moving target. Everyone wants to overthrow you, and then step on the corpse of the defending champion to pick up that supreme honor. If you can’t hold on, you’ll fall from the throne and be eaten by a group of hungry wolves waiting down there.</p>
<p>“Go and call Beckham back.” Twain said to Kerslake, who was behind him.</p>
<p>He was going to make adjustments.</p>
<p>Lennon did not perform as actively as he did in the first half under the opponent’s continued high pressure. The Forest team’s few attacks in the second half came from Ribéry and Bale, and Lennon only worn himself out in defense. Coupled with his sole means of attack, which was to break through by speed, Chelsea quickly saw through him. Ashley Cole was no slowcoach either. When the pair of them went head to head, Lennon was basically forsook.</p>
<p>David Beckham ran back from the warm-up area. The two men looked at each other, and Twain pulled him to the sidelines. He said, “You go up and replace Lennon. I need your long pass to send the football out, in addition to contributing in defense.”</p>
<p>Beckham nodded.</p>
<p>“After the team presses up, you can go up and try the long shot. Tell Bale that the corner kicks are all yours.” Other than the routine business, Twain lowered his voice to Beckham and said, “David.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“I’ve built the stage for you to prove yourself.”</p>
<p>Beckham glanced at Twain in surprise.</p>
<p>Twain did not say anything else. He patted Beckham on the back and let him to follow the fourth official to the sidelines.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the seventy-seventh minute, Nottingham Forest made its first substitution in the game. Number 24, David Beckham replaced number 17, Aaron Lennon.</p>
<p>This substitution did not produce an immediate effect. It was Chelsea which continued to be powerful in the second half and maintain its siege on the Nottingham Forest’s goal. In the seventy-ninth minute, Malouda passed the ball after he broke out in the flank. Drogba got ahead of Pepe and Piqué and shot, but he hit it high.</p>
<p>It looked like he did not bring his striker boots today.</p>
<p>In the eightieth minute, Beckham finally gave Eastwood a good shot. Eastwood, who played tolerably in this game, adjusted slightly outside the box and swung his leg to shoot. But this shot was too high and was not within the range of the goalmouth.</p>
<p>Chelsea stepped up their defensive strength in the second half and Eastwood, who was not dominant in strength, largely disappeared. His two shots did not threaten the opponent’s goal.</p>
<p>The commentator was unable to put up with it any longer and said, “If I were to give marks in this game so far, both sides have players with the lowest marks. The recipient on Chelsea’s side is Drogba, and there is no doubt that on this side of Nottingham Forest, it is Eastwood. The Welsh striker was completely at a disadvantage in the physical confrontation with the Chelsea defenders, as if he was afraid of this kind of physical confrontation. He pulled his position outside the box, avoided the opposing defenders and moved away from the goal, while he also hindered van der Vaart’s play here. Manager Twain had just replaced Lennon. Although Lennon’s second-half performance was not brilliant, he was still very active in the first half. And what about Eastwood? Maybe Twain is going to think about a substitution again.”</p>
<p>Twain was indeed considering whether to replace Eastwood or not. Multiple injuries had greatly diminished his strength, while at the same time he had a shadow in his mind about physical confrontation. Chelsea’s change of defensive strategy and reliance on toughness were certainly not specifically aimed at Eastwood, but it had created an objective phenomenon that had made Eastwood disappear.</p>
<p>Should I bring him off?</p>
<p>“Tony?” Dunn also noticed that Eastwood’s performance was getting worse. Perhaps it was due to his stamina close to exhaustion that he did not run as actively as he did in the first half.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Do you want another substitution?”</p>
<p>Twain nodded and said, “You go and call Bendtner back.”</p>
<p>This decision surprised Dunn a little. Nottingham Forest’s substitute players were all warming up in the warm-up area at this time and ready to play. Dunn did not expect Twain to bring on Turner instead of Arshavin.</p>
<p>“You’re going to play a double center forward?” Next to him, Kerslake also asked puzzledly.</p>
<p>“No, van Nistelrooy’s physical strength is not enough to confront Terry and Carvalho. I’m going to change him.” Twain made the decision to keep Eastwood on the field, believing that the Romani was a smart player and knew to use his brains to play. Not running actively? That’s just him prolonging his stamina as he is mulling over a fatal blow. You look at his running position. He can run to a key position every time. Otherwise why were the Forest team’s two shots in the second half completed by him?</p>
<p>Dunn did not refute, nor did he raise objections. He obeyed the instructions and went. On the other hand, Kerslake could not figure out what Twain had in mind. He said, “Ruud has experience. With him around, Chelsea’s two center backs are restrained to a certain extent. And Freddy, he already can’t run anymore …”</p>
<p>Twain glanced at him and said, “Don’t tell me it will be easy for the other two center backs when we bring on Bendtner? Bendtner’s body is stronger than van Nistelrooy’s. His stamina is better. With him there, he can continue to suppress Terry and Carvalho. Eastwood remains on the field because he’s our second point during the counterattacks.”</p>
<p>Kerslake need not say anything else as Bendtner had already run back with excitement. Twain left him aside and went up.</p>
<p>“Your chance is here, kid.” Twain said with a smile. Twain pinned on his hopes and Nottingham Forest’s future on this kid. Van Nistelrooy will leave sooner or later. Then, the main center forward here is you, Nick!</p>
<p>Bendtner nodded as this was certainly his chance. Any fool would know that the team had met with some difficulty and needed someone to step up and be the hero to save the team and retake the title.</p>
<p>And at this time, the boss chose him!</p>
<p>“Once you go up, get to the front, push Terry and Carvalho back into the box and create chances for the others in the back to plug in.” Twain’s first instruction doused cold water on Bendtner.</p>
<p>A tactical center forward again! Bendtner hated this phrase. As the front most center forward, he would not be the first choice to attack and besiege the goal, but to act as a foil for the others! This was simply…</p>
<p>But still he nodded his head. In the team, the absolute authority belonged to Tony Twain and no one dared to express his displeasure to him in person. No, someone dared to, but that man was later driven away.</p>
<p>“Of course, if there’s a better chance, then you can choose to do your own shot.” Twain said with a smile, “Don’t always think about creating opportunities for your teammates.” He had no idea what kind of upheavals Bendtner was experiencing on the inside now.</p>
<p>“Go on!” He gave Bendtner a push, and Twain continued to stand on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Bendtner replaced a somewhat exhausted van Nistelrooy. Twain completely did not intend to maintain a draw to play overtime or even a penalty shootout. Although the team practiced the penalty kicks before the game, that was just routine practice for just in case. He did not want to play the penalty shootout himself. He might like to watch this brutal way of winning when he was a fan, but he hated it since he became a manager. Why? Because using this way to decide did not to rely on which team is stronger, nor did it rely on which team’s tactics were more reasonable. It relied on the team’s psychological quality and luck, with the component of luck being greater … As a manager, he should take every situation into account so that when things happened, they were always within his control. And a penalty shootout was thoroughly a matter which he could not control, so he hated it.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After Bendtner came on, he maintained the Forest team’s pressure on Chelsea’s rear defensive line. While Eastwood was still hanging near the box, where his main area of activity was at the top of the arc outside the penalty area.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest had fully used its substitutions and Chelsea began to adjust. Grant an brought on an injured Kalou to replace Malouda who had a yellow card and was becoming increasingly agitated. This at least removed a hidden danger. Grant was already getting ready for overtime play. What if Malouda lost his head in the final minutes of the game and took another yellow card?</p>
<p>Grant even prepared for the penalty shootout while he got ready for overtime. However, the players on the field lost all their strength and were ready for a last-ditch fight. With less than ten minutes before the end of the game, the time to fight was now. This was a common idea that the players on both sides had. They were just players. Regardless of how many ideas the managers had in mind, and for whatever reasons, they only had one idea as players which was to beat their immediate opponents, win the game, end this damn final and pick up the trophy!</p>
<p>We can’t beat Nottingham Forest? This is ridiculous. On this evening, we’ll show the world what a big a joke that is. We’ll beat Nottingham Forest, this bunch of bastards and put Chelsea on top of the world! Take down the first Champions League title in the club’s history!</p>
<p>Don’t be deluded, you Stamford Bridge bastards. The championship trophy is ours, belongs to Nottingham Forest. We’ll show you what happens if you dare try to touch without our permission!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 656 - Mightiness Revealed Again</p>
<p>“It’s now eight minutes away from the end of the game. If there are no surprises, the injury stoppage time should be three minutes—the second half went smoothly. That means there are eleven minutes left. If the winner still is still undetermined, then both sides will be dragged into a thirty-minute overtime. For now, Grant had changed only one player, while Tony Twain had changed two players in one breath. The intentions of the two managers could be seen clearly in these substitutions.”</p>
<p>“Grant wants to play overtime and even a penalty shootout. It was reported that Chelsea had also specially practiced the penalty kicks the day before the match. But Tony Twain doesn’t want to give him the chance. He prefers to settle the fight in ninety minutes compared to overtime and penalty shootout.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Rafinha now took the ball. He hesitated a little before he did a wall pass with Beckham, and then continued to dribble the ball to plug ahead. At this time, everyone’s physical strength was not good and Rafinha must clench his teeth to persist. The idea of supporting him was “the other side is much better than himself” so Rafinha gnashed his teeth and rushed up.</p>
<p>Ashley Cole felt his job was a lot easier after Lennon left, because Beckham did not have the ability to break through. As a defender, all he had was to hold his position and there would be no problem. To prevent a cross pass? That was a matter for the center back.</p>
<p>Ashley Cole, who saw the Nottingham Forest number 14 charged up with the ball, went up to take him on after a short break. He was not afraid of going head to head alone with Rafinha.</p>
<p>Even the flourishing Cristiano Ronaldo had to think twice about whether to break through in the face of himself.</p>
<p>What more a mere full back from the Brazilian Olympic team?</p>
<p>He was ready to take on the enemy, but Rafinha did not give him a chance to have a face-off with him. He sent the football across to Beckham as he ran.</p>
<p>Ashley Cole froze a little and chose to continue to follow Rafinha to retreat. He feared that Beckham would sent the ball behind him with a straight pass. But Beckham did not plan to pass the ball at all. He did not hesitate to shoot for the goal when he got the ball!</p>
<p>“David Beckham’s long shot—”</p>
<p>Čech once again made a high level save. He flew out and knocked out the football with a single palm!</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s offensive was not over yet.</p>
<p>Eastwood appeared at the drop point of the football. As long as he shot it out, the football would fly into the empty goal!</p>
<p>Čech fell to the ground and completely lost his balance. There was nothing he could do about Nottingham Forest’s subsequent attack.</p>
<p>Terry stood forward.</p>
<p>Eastwood’s shot hit Terry on the head, and it flew out of the crossbar!</p>
<p>“Ah—what a pity! If this ball had gone in, Nottingham Forest would almost lock in the win!”</p>
<p>Everyone groaned in the Nottingham Forest’s technical area and substitutes’ bench.</p>
<p>“Freddy used too much force!” Kerslake complained with frustrated, “If he hadn’t volley that shot, but just kicked, Terry wouldn’t have time to react at all.”</p>
<p>He was right. Eastwood seemed to lose the cool of a striker at that moment and chose the most inopportune way to shoot.</p>
<p>In this regard, Twain could only gently shake his head. The continuous serious injuries caused Eastwood to no longer be the way he first was … Good things always belonged to the past.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Čech climbed up from the ground and clapped his hands with Terry to thank him for his last-minute lift of the siege. Then he started directing the defense in the box. A corner kick was just as dangerous. But maybe it could be a chance too?</p>
<p>Pepe and Piqué saw that Nottingham Forest had received a corner kick and ran into Chelsea’s box at the same time to get ready to compete for the header.</p>
<p>Chelsea prepared to meet the enemy. Even Drogba was back in the box to defend. However, Joe Cole chose to stand near the center circle, waiting for a chance to fight back without knowing if it would come.</p>
<p>George Wood initially wanted to go up and participate in the attack. But after he saw Joe Cole, he changed his mind at the last minute and went over to stand quietly beside Joe Cole.</p>
<p>When Beckham placed the football, the Chelsea fans was behind him and those fanatical fans kept using language and gestures to provoke and insult him as they tried to distract him. But he seemed to turn a deaf ear to it. After he placed the football, he moved back to wait for the referee’s whistle.</p>
<p>This was a corner kick positioned on the left side of the goal. With a right-footed player like Beckham to execute, the football would spin inwards. The area close to the front and back points of the goalpost were generally the most dangerous place. It would also be the place where most of the Chelsea and Nottingham Forest players gathered.</p>
<p>Beckham’s shot after he ran up to is did not cross the top of any person’s head. It flew high, bypassed the front goalpost and descended midway to directly spurt toward a point in the back of the goal!</p>
<p>It was actually …</p>
<p>“He directly shot at the goal!”</p>
<p>Čech was going to strike directly to take the ball, but he had just stepped out to find something was wrong. The football was very high, fast and the direction of its trajectory was behind him—the goal!</p>
<p>He immediately hurried to jump, looked up at the football in the air, and then struggled to reach his hands out to touch the football. He no longer expected to directly get the ball. It would be all right providing he could poke out the football.</p>
<p>He failed to touch the football and only caught a gust of the wind.</p>
<p>“Clang!”</p>
<p>A few minutes ago, this noise annoyed the Chelsea fans, but now they thought it was music to their ears!</p>
<p>Beckham’s surprise choice fell short and the football hit above the crossbar to directly bounce out of the end line.</p>
<p>The swearing voices behind him all disappeared with the brittle sound that popped out of this impact. Those extreme Chelsea fans had yet to snap out of their horror when David Beckham had already run far.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Kerslake was still holding his head in vexation. Grant was still worried about his heart. A new wave of offense from the Forest team was here again. Nottingham Forest was even crazier in the final stages of the game. They could not wait to pick up the trophy for a second time. Who would be willing to wait another thirty minutes and wait for another penalty shootout?</p>
<p>In just a few minutes, Chelsea had to withdraw entirely. A player like Joe Cole, who was still fantasizing about fighting back, also had to go back to defend under Terry’s loud hailing. As the captain, Terry knew exactly what kind of situation this was—if they could not withstand, then they would lose …</p>
<p>When he saw the team entirely retreated in the last few minutes according to his instructions, Grant felt less worried even though his heart had to continue to suffer.</p>
<p>Because Nottingham Forest did not intend to let Chelsea go just like that.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart took a long shot outside the box which was stopped by Čech. The Czech Republic national goalkeeper wanted to throw the ball and launch a counterattack, but Drogba’s ball was intercepted by George Wood who went round to the front to defend. Wood diverted the intercepted football to Ribéry who was in excellent form in this game. Ribéry passed the ball after he forced a breakthrough into the box from the flank. A melee broke out in front of the goal. As a result, no one touched the football. The ball brushed against the goalpost to roll out the end line.</p>
<p>Chelsea drove out another goal ball which was intercepted again. George Wood did a feint. After he created the illusion of passing the ball, he dribbled the ball and plugged in, which stirred the Chelsea rear defensive line into a mess. However, he suddenly diverted the ball.</p>
<p>The target of his pass this time was Bendtner.</p>
<p>Bendtner had his back to the direction of the attack and wanted to turn around to strike the goal.</p>
<p>It did not look like he was going to hand over this offensive opportunity easily, whether it was to Chelsea or his own teammates …</p>
<p>His persistence in the box attracted three Chelsea players, Terry, Carvalho and Makelele.</p>
<p>The three men encircled him. It was almost impossible for him to turn around, never mind shooting at the goal.</p>
<p>“Get the ball out!” Van der Vaart shouted in a hurry outside.</p>
<p>Bendtner gnashed his teeth—F**king Chelsea! There goes my chance!</p>
<p>He saw a red figure in the cracks between the crowd. He could not see the number on the back of the jersey nor the face and did not know who it was. But it was enough to know that it was his teammate.</p>
<p>Bendtner leaned back hard against Terry’s body and acted as if he wanted to forcibly turn around to shoot, so as to attract the Chelsea players to put their focus behind him. He then quickly gave a kick and passed the football out through a crack in the crowd!</p>
<p>“What a beautiful pass!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was a little too late as Eastwood ran and overshot.</p>
<p>The Romani thought Bendtner would make a cross pass so that he could shoot directly. After all, there were a lot of people in the penalty area. A slight delay could cost him the chance to score.</p>
<p>He did not expect Bendtner to do a return pass. He ran over only to discover this point and hurriedly braked. His right foot dragged in the back and barely hooked the football. It was not directly taken away by the Chelsea players.</p>
<p>But he had lost the immediacy and covert opportunity to shoot at the first instance in this way. The best chance to score was gone. So, what could he do next? Should he protect the ball and wait for his teammates’ support? That meant that he had to turn his back to the goal …</p>
<p>Eastwood was not willing to do that.</p>
<p>Bendtner acted independently because he was a striker and the striker’s job was to score goals. Therefore, Eastwood would act independently too. He played averagely in this game, and he wanted to prove his contribution to the team with a goal.</p>
<p>When I was still a cripple helping my father sell used cars at home and a down-and-out player who occasionally played in an amateur league, did I ever had such a dream? To play in the final of the European clubs’ top level tournament? But now this is not a dream. I scored a goal in last year’s Champions League final, which was the goal that locked in the victory. I can do it again this year!</p>
<p>After Eastwood made up his mind to act alone, he completely ignore his teammates’ positions. At this juncture, he only had eyes and attention for the opposing defensive players. With his back to the goal, he felt the pressure from behind which should be from Ashley Cole.</p>
<p>Terry had already given up on Bendtner and turned around to pounce on him.</p>
<p>There was no time to hesitate here. In case he was surrounded, a pass would become the only option.</p>
<p>The idea of a dive in the box was not something that crossed Eastwood’s mind. Some strikers would choose to do so in times of crisis, in hopes that the referee would award a penalty shot to them. But this foolish thought only flashed across his mind before it was immediately tossed out. He was not that kind of person, and he knew the chief would not allow him to do that.</p>
<p>To throw away the opportunity grasped in hand, and then to count on the subjective judgment of the unreliable referee, this practice was no different from being a fool. As long as the opportunity was in his own hands, he could not discard it even if there was only 0.001 percent!</p>
<p>Stepping the football under his feet, Eastwood felt the pressure coming from behind him. He judged the distance between him and the other person, while he observed Terry’s extended feet.</p>
<p>These men clearly do not want to act too bold outside the box and rush to make a move. Unless I shoot, they will continue to encircle me while they wait for backup. Once one more player comes to defend, I will be out of luck. Their chance to make a move to intercept will only show up once I shoot …</p>
<p>Once he made up his mind, Eastwood slightly adjusted his stance to let himself face Ashley Cole and Terry sideways and not with his back toward Ashley Cole and face Terry like he did just now. Following which, he made to look like he was going to swing his leg to shoot, prompting Terry to make a move to intercept on the right side.</p>
<p>But in fact, Eastwood did not swing his leg. He just moved a little. Upon seeing Terry move, he immediately jabbed the football behind himself with his foot. Even though he could only turn around at a narrow angle, this was the only gap and the only chance to shoot …</p>
<p>The Chelsea defenders wanted to push Eastwood close to the end line so that even if he was allowed to shoot, it would not be threat.</p>
<p>After he jabbed the football behind him, Eastwood leaned against Ashley Cole to turn around on the spot. He had just turned around and saw the football under his feet. Although he was now very close to the end line, he still did not hesitate to poke the football toward the end line while half of his body made use of the momentum to zip out from the encirclement!</p>
<p>A Cruyff Turn!</p>
<p>Although his body had not completely shook off the Chelsea defenders’ entanglement, Eastwood could not wait for that to happen. He did not adjust the football at all and directly swung his left leg in a very narrow angle to vigorously blast the goal!</p>
<p>Like an artillery shell, the football flew past Ashley Cole.</p>
<p>Čech was convinced he had sealed off all the shot angles and he anchored himself as he waited for Eastwood to shoot. He had just saw the football rolled out of the crowd when he saw a leg whipped out and the football swooped over!</p>
<p>So fast!</p>
<p>That was Čech’s only thought. Before he could see the striker, he saw the football fly over. In the circumstances where the distance was very close, the other party made use of the strength and footwork of a long shot. The football instantly glided over the top of his head, which this ball would fly straight out of the end line nine out of ten times…</p>
<p>Eastwood had no idea where Čech was or whether the goal had a small gap at all before he shot. He completed this difficult shot with the instinct of a striker. What did he need to do next?</p>
<p>Pray?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>The opportunity is still in my hands. Who do I pray to?</p>
<p>“Clang!” It was the sound of the football striking the goalpost again. Only this time it did not popped out of the end line.</p>
<p>Čech lifted his head, and his sight followed the football from start to finish. Even if his body could not keep up, he could still follow with his eyes. He saw the football struck the edge of the crossbar and slammed upward. When it bounced up on the net, it hit the net…</p>
<p>When he raised his head too far behind, Čech lost his balance and fell on his back to the ground. His eyes were still staring at the football fallen inside the goal!</p>
<p>“Eastwooooooooooo—gooooooooal!!! Freddy Eastwood! Freddy Eastwood!! This is the fatal shot! A fatal shot! Absolutely beautiful!!”</p>
<p>When Eastwood, who lost his balance and fell straight out of the end line after the shot, saw the football enter the goal, he tried to jump up but found that he was long exhausted. He could only lie on the ground. He raised his hands high and clenched into fists, pointing to the raining night sky. His face had a fierce expression due to excessive excitement.</p>
<p>“Eight-nine minutes!! This is a goal that almost locked in the victory! Does Chelsea still have a chance? Is there still a chance?”</p>
<p>“Even if they want to equalize again, this time Nottingham Forest will never say yes!”</p>
<p>The excited Nottingham Forest players collectively raced to outside Chelsea’s goal. Instead of pressing up, they laid on ground with Eastwood and pointed their fists at the sky.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“I did not f**king replace him, wow haha … That’s so f**king brilliant!” Twain laughed heartily and yelled on the sidelines, completely without the reserve that a manager generally had.</p>
<p>“Freddy, you’re my lucky treasure! You’re the champion striker! As long as you score, the title is ours!”</p>
<p>Kerslake was excited at the time and completely forgot that he had suggested earlier to Twain that he should replace Eastwood, who was physically tired and did not perform well.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Eastwood is really a striker with the ability to decide the outcome of the game! In last year’s Champions League final, it was his last-minute goal that helped the team lock in the victory to wipe out AC Milan’s confidence to fight back. And now, once again, his single shot sealed the fate as they are about to enter the injury stoppage time!”</p>
<p>“Who could have imagined that such a striker was playing in an amateur competition four years ago and helping his father sell used cars for a living?”</p>
<p>“Nottingham Forest is really a miraculous team! With players like that and such a team, they always amaze us!”</p>
<p>“The first defending champion since the restructuring of the UEFA Champions League … is about to be born!!”</p>
<p>“They will go down in history, and they will continue to create legends. In these two seasons since the start of the 07-08 season, European football has only one color and only one name. It’s red and it belongs to Nottingham Forest!”</p>
<p>The commentators for the live broadcast of game were going insane. They banged on the tables and stomped their feet as they tried their best to raise their volume and spoke fast to show their passion.</p>
<p>The last-minute fatal shot literally impassioned all the people watching this game instantly!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Did anyone else still care about the Chelsea team?</p>
<p>The Chelsea players on the field stood rooted to the ground when the football bounced into the goal. They were unable to accept such an outcome at all. How could… How could we let the opponent score at the last minute? Is it our defense that’s not doing well enough? No! No…</p>
<p>Grant sat in the technical area, or it was more appropriate to say that he was “slumped” in his seat in the technical area. He felt as if he had no bones in his entire body at this moment. His face was ashen as if he had lost his life.</p>
<p>To spoil the ship for a ha’penny worth of tar…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“During Brian Clough’s most brilliant period, he led Nottingham Forest to win a domestic league title and two Champions League titles. Similarly, a defending champion, Tony Twain still has the opportunity and time to surpass his predecessor because he has now caught up with his legendary predecessor. Now he can start shaping a new hero and a new legend in the history of Nottingham Forest Football Club!”</p>
<p>“Don’t be happy too soon, the game is not over yet! There are still at least three minutes left … A football is round!”</p>
<p>“Remember what that guy Tony Twain said before in last year’s Champions League final? His football is triangular! Ha ha!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“We got the whole world in our hands; we are Nottingham Forest! We’re the f**king greatest team in the world! Oh, oh, oh–We’re the champions! Nottingham Forest is the champion!”</p>
<p>The Nottingham Forest fans did not care such crap about “the football is round.” They could not wait to start declaring their claim on the title.</p>
<p>For a moment, the loud song rippled across the stands in the Luzhniki stadium, piercing the layers of fog, straight beyond the clouds!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 657 - All Hail The Double Winner!</p>
<p>“Freddy Eastwood is in trouble. He’s caught in between two Chelsea players, front and back. The football is at his feet, but there’s no way he can turn and shoot. If one more player comes up, the ball is bound to be intercepted … He turns around … and shoots—the ball goes in! The ball went in! The ball is in–!!! The—fatal—shot—that—ends—the game!!”</p>
<p>The commentator’s excited roar came from the television set.</p>
<p>Even more excited than him were that the Nottingham Forest fans in front of the televisions. Those people who could not watch the live at the stadium, had to choose to watch it in crowded pubs. They were really lucky to see such a thrilling scene towards the end of the game.</p>
<p>“Champion! We’re the champions!”</p>
<p>The Double Winner!”</p>
<p>“Tony, I love you so damn much. I bloody love you—”</p>
<p>“Whoa, whoa—are you going to propose to him, Joel?”</p>
<p>“If I were a woman, I would marry him!”</p>
<p>“Ahaha haha …”</p>
<p>Such scenes appeared in pubs where the Nottingham Forest fans gathered, including Kenny Burns’ Forest bar.</p>
<p>“Beer! More beer! How can we not have a drink at a time like this?”</p>
<p>“Cheers! To the Champion!”</p>
<p>“Cheers! For The Double Winner!”</p>
<p>People had stopped watching the television or listened to the commentator for quite a while. Everyone was focused on downing the drinks and loudly declared the victory and excitement.</p>
<p>Someone raised his glass high to toast Burns behind the bar and Burns also raised his glass to clink the glass. That man drained his drink while Burns just took a sip. He needed to stay sober as the owner of the pub.</p>
<p>That did not mean he was not happy with the Forest team’s results. He might actually be happier and more excited than everyone here. A defending champion and a Premier League champion … Twenty-eight years had passed, and that scene seemed to emerge in front of Burns’ eyes. It was also this same group of people, but at that time they were still young and could follow the team around. They witnessed Nottingham Forest’s first glory in its history at the Bernabéu stadium— it was “the most brilliant” before Tony Twain—Now these people were older and most of them had graying temples.</p>
<p>Time flew by really quickly.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the heavy rain in Moscow, the frenzied celebration in the Luzhniki Stadium was finally suspended by the referee’s forced intervention. The game was not over, and Chelsea still had a chance to attack and equalize the score. If he allowed the Nottingham Forest players to celebrate so recklessly, he was bound to encounter angry complain from the Chelsea players, stating that they took the opportunity to waste the game time.</p>
<p>Just as the Nottingham Forest players returned to the pitch, the fourth official also stood on the sidelines. He held up the electronic display board and the number displayed was the last injury stoppage time for this game—three minutes!</p>
<p>Chelsea still had the last three minutes left to equalize the score. If they were unable to score, they would regret that they had narrowly missed the championship trophy.</p>
<p>Twain also recovered from the excitement. He stood on the sidelines with his arms across his chest and stared nervously at the field. Anything could happen in the last three minutes. The Manchester United ‘s Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 1999 came to mind…</p>
<p>You all must not relax by all means! He stared at the Nottingham Forest players on the field as he said in his mind with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“Three more minutes, we must hold our ground!” Van Nistelrooy, who had been brought off, patted his sports jacket as he stood on the sidelines and cupped his hands near his mouth to shouted toward the field.</p>
<p>Grant had completed a substitution during Nottingham Forest’s frenzied celebration. This time he replaced two players in one go and did not leave a backup to play overtime with Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Shevchenko replaced Joe Cole, who had been feckless under Nottingham Forest’s ferocious tackles. Belletti replaced the physically exhausted Makelele.</p>
<p>It was clear that he wanted to step up the attack and intended to stake all on one throw in the last three minutes.</p>
<p>The game resumed and Chelsea kept the football at their feet. They pushed into Nottingham Forest penalty area. The Chelsea players were also smart enough not to rush and send the football straight to the front of the Forest team’s goal with a long pass, as that could lead to a quicker loss of ball possession.</p>
<p>As long as the football was on their side, they could launch an attack at any time. There was not much time. At this important time, it was not the number of attacks that counted but the quality that mattered.</p>
<p>Ashley Cole also rushed up and threw himself into the offense. Lampard passed the football over when he saw him.</p>
<p>At the final moments, Ashley Cole relied on his speed to drive forward. He finally broke through Rafinha and ripped a gash in Nottingham Forest’s defensive line on the right!</p>
<p>The cheers of the Chelsea fans at the scene rang out.</p>
<p>The Forest players though Ashley Cole was bound to cross from the byline. Pepe rushed up to block to keep him out of the box, while Drogba in the middle was handed over to Piqué.</p>
<p>Ashley Cole did not pass the football to Drogba and did not even send it to the front of the goal. He did a direct pass from the side of the rear and the football flew outside the box!</p>
<p>Ballack received the ball and he made to look like he was going to shoot at the goal to throw George Wood off his balance and make him block with his body. Instead, it turned out to be a pass. The target was Lampard on the other side!</p>
<p>This corner pass was wonderful. Lampard was almost unmarked when he caught the ball. He turned around and shot directly after he got the football!</p>
<p>Everyone got up from their seats. If it went in, the Nottingham Forest fans would have gotten happy for nothing. If it did not go in… Chelsea would be screwed.</p>
<p>“Clang!”</p>
<p>How many times had this sound been heard in this game?</p>
<p>“The crossbar stopped Lampard’s shot! The crossbar stopped Chelsea!”</p>
<p>The football hit the crossbar and bounced back, so the offensive was not done yet.</p>
<p>Although Lampard did not shoot the ball into the goal, it also bypassed the entire Forest team rear defensive line. Shevchenko appeared at the ball’s drop point and he had a chance to kick the football into the goal …</p>
<p>“And he shoots—”</p>
<p>The football flew straight out of the crossbar …</p>
<p>He did not kick in the correct position and shot high.</p>
<p>Tony Twain felt his legs go soft. This was too much for his heart to take… He pressed his left chest with his hand and could clearly feel his heart beating wildly.</p>
<p>“Damn it …” He muttered feebly.</p>
<p>Next to him, Kerslake groaned, “You know what, I almost thought I had a heart attack just now…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“This could even be arguably the best attacking opportunity for Chelsea in the second half. But the crossbar rejected Lampard and Shevchenko’s follow up shot was directly sent to the sky! Chelsea has terrible luck! Or we should say Nottingham Forest’s luck has been so good …”</p>
<p>Shevchenko held his head in his hands. He had a chance to be a hero … However, with such a short playing time, he had not even warm up from running. His feet were still cool. How could be any feel for a shot? If he had five more minutes … Damn it! Son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Lampard stood in front of the goal, looking weakly at the shocked opposing goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar. He had gotten a lucky shot in the first half. It looked like the luck had run over to the other side in the second half.</p>
<p>He had used too much force. If he had been a little lighter and the football moved down a little bit, it could have flown directly into the goal and Edwin van der Sar would have to put his hands down in surrender …</p>
<p>Gareth Bale wildly hugged and kissed the goalpost. He could no longer used words to describe his mood at this moment.</p>
<p>This missed goal hit Chelsea’s morale hard. Although there was still over a minute left in the game, the Chelsea players appeared no longer able to lift up their spirits to attack. Furthermore, Nottingham Forest kept the football firmly under their feet and was in no hurry to attack. They only kept passing the ball back and forth in the back and midfield. The Nottingham Forest players were unmoved, even if they were collectively booed by the Chelsea fans.</p>
<p>In this way the game was getting closer to the end.</p>
<p>Even the commentator announced, “The game is basically over. Chelsea’s morale was hit by the crossbar just now. They seem to have lost all the courage and fighting spirit all of a sudden. They completely do not know how to play in the remaining minute of the game. The football is now under Nottingham Forest’s control and the Chelsea players are played by them to run around in circles …”</p>
<p>In the stands, a man who hid himself in a windbreaker saw this scene and shook his head silently.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The football was still at the feet of the Nottingham Forest players. With the exception of Lampard, the Chelsea players had no intention of coming up to grab the ball at all. They could tell that Nottingham Forest wanted to waste the time until the end of the game. No one wanted to go up and be the monkey that had been fooled …</p>
<p>Outside of Nottingham Forest’s substitutes’ bench and technical area, the players and coaches gathered on the sidelines, waiting for the referee to blow the whistle three times so that they could rush in to celebrate.</p>
<p>Caught in the crowd, Twain tried to hide the joy on his face as the game was not over yet. He did not want the people on the field to think they could relax.</p>
<p>The Chelsea fans became still and quiet in the stands at Luzhniki Stadium. The Nottingham Forest fans had been singing nonstop since Eastwood’s goal. Other than Lampard’s shot and Shevchenko’s follow up shot which gave them a slight pause, their singing voices were now mixed with growing cheers. Every one of them—no, all the Nottingham Forest fans—were waiting for that moment to arrive.</p>
<p>The referee looked at the watch. He already had the whistle in his mouth. Perhaps they would hear the sweet-sounding whistle the next second.</p>
<p>There were ten seconds left in the injury stoppage time.</p>
<p>Lampard kept running and finally intercepted the ball! This might be Chelsea’s last chance!</p>
<p>There were seven seconds left in the injury stoppage time.</p>
<p>George Wood charged out from the side and pressed on Lampard till he could not dribble the ball to go out nor pass it. Lampard went crazy trying to get rid of Wood. He was betting that the ball was on the offensive side now. Unless this attack completely failed, the referee would not blow the whistle to end the game. But… first he needed to show that he was attacking and not hopelessly tangled with George Wood in the midfield.</p>
<p>Wood gazed coolly at the Chelsea number 8, who was once his teammate in the England national team. He could relate to his thirst for victory and desire for the title. But unfortunately, we are rivals. I’m going to disappoint you this time.</p>
<p>Lampard was waiting for his teammates’ support. He was afraid to do a return pass, fearing that the referee would blow the whistle as soon as he passed the ball.</p>
<p>Wood discovered that Lampard did not seem to focus all his attention on the football under his feet. This was an opportunity!</p>
<p>Without hesitation, he extended his foot out in the back to poke at the ball. Lampard staggered and lost the ball!</p>
<p>After he realized that the football had been intercepted, Lampard’s heart suddenly turned cold like an ice cave.</p>
<p>Then he heard the last sound he wanted to hear:</p>
<p>“Beep! Beep! Beep—”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“The game is over—” The commentator’s voice was immediately drowned out by the louder cheers.</p>
<p>The Nottingham Forest players and coaches, waiting on the sidelines, stormed onto the field in a swarm.</p>
<p>Twain did not act so excited. He had not forgotten that he had to shake hands with the other manager. Although he still did not like Grant, he did not refuse to shake hands with the loser as the victor.</p>
<p>Hence he walked smilingly to Grant.</p>
<p>Grant came up with an ashen face.</p>
<p>The two men did not speak. It was not appropriate to say that they shook hands. The tips of their fingers touched, and they immediately parted.</p>
<p>Grant turned around to comfort his players, while Twain was surrounded by the reporters.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on your team’s creation of a new history, Mr. Twain!”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Would you like to say a few words?”</p>
<p>“Before the final I thought we should take the title, and that we should be the best team in the whole of Europe … No, the entire world. I’m very happy that this result proves my idea.” Taking the title made the already arrogant Twain even more arrogant, He certainly was qualified to arrogant…</p>
<p>The reporters liked to see him arrogant. Whenever, he was arrogant, he would spout a lot of remarks that made the media feel very happy. The readers would be thrilled by the media’s titillation and then everyone would reach a high.</p>
<p>“Care to give us your evaluation of your opponent? Chelsea caused you a bit of trouble in the second half …”</p>
<p>“It’s just some trouble.” Twain wagged his right index finger, which strikingly resembled Bruce Lee’s gesture, made him a favorite of the photographers. His extremely arrogant picture could appear on all the media’s front pages tomorrow.</p>
<p>“They did a good job in the second half. However well they did, they did not score. Instead they let us score and take the title. This meant we did better than they did!”</p>
<p>“How does it feel to be The Double Winner and the defending champion of the Champions League title?”</p>
<p>“It’s f**king awesome! Ha ha!” Twain guffawed. He could not help but burst out with foul language. It was the pinnacle of his life now and he stood high in the clouds with happiness. He fully enjoyed the compliments, praise and touts of those reporters, the joy of winning the championship, the thrill he had never experienced in his previous life …</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the VIP box, Shania got up from her seat and looked at Tony Twain, who was surrounded by the reporters. She observed wordlessly for a moment and then said to Gloria next to her, “We should go, Clarice.” ”</p>
<p>Gloria pointed to below and asked her, “You’re really not going to say hello, or goodbye?”</p>
<p>“With so many media around, what am I going to do there?” Shania said with a frown, “I can say goodbye on the phone.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to at least let him know you came to watch his game?”</p>
<p>Shania laughed, “This is his moment. I’d better not disturb.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>David Beckham was with the other players, giving thanks to the Nottingham Forest fans in the stands. He was not as excited as his teammates around him. He had experienced big occasions, but he was still very happy.</p>
<p>He did not expect that when he transferred to Nottingham Forest, he could actually win the Premier League and Champions League titles in one breath within a season. It was almost comparable to his 1998-1999 season at Manchester United.</p>
<p>Who would not like championships titles and who would not like to win?</p>
<p>Suddenly he was hugged by someone from behind. Bale’s excited voice sounded in his ear, “David! We’re the champions! Haha, we’re the champions again!”</p>
<p>Beckham glanced back at the happy little monkey and said, “Ah, yes, we are the champions again.” He emphasized on “again.”</p>
<p>This was his second UEFA Champions League title.</p>
<p>The reporters rushed toward David Beckham and wanted to interview him about what he thought of the championship title as the “newcomer” of Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>This was definitely not special treatment. The other Nottingham Forest players were being interviewed individually. Everyone simply said a few words and it could become a vivid and lively newspaper report the next day</p>
<p>However, George Wood turned down such an interview. He hid in a slightly quieter spot to call his mum.</p>
<p>The two players, Bendtner and Chimbonda, who was once kicked out of the First Team for fighting during training, also hugged together to celebrate the title. Because of the championship title, all the contradictions did not exist…Of course, it was for the time being.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Just as this group of people was feverishly celebrating or being interviewed, another group of people had put up a billboard in the center to announce the champion. Against the background of the UEFA Champions League logo, the words were in bold red letters:</p>
<p>The UEFA Champions League Winner of the 2007-2008 Season</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest!</p>
<p>Due to the poor weather conditions, it was still raining, and the award ceremony was not held in the middle of the stadium, but on the president’s podium. The red carpet had been laid out from the bottom of the steps to the top. This was the path to the championship and the road of glory.</p>
<p>Chelsea went up first to receive the first runner prize. Each of them was awarded with a silver medal. It was believed that these people must be unhappy when they received the awards. No one wanted to get a silver medal after he advanced to the final. Like how Twain complained in the locker room three years ago, why should he take the silver medal only to serve as a prop to the champion?</p>
<p>The Chelsea players came to the stage with sullen faces to receive the awards. Without saying much, they did not even have smiles on their faces. Most people took the silver medals off their necks and clutched them in their hands after they came down. When everyone received the award on the stage, they would look at the glittering trophy with reluctance. It was so close and yet so far …</p>
<p>The last person to take the stage to accept the silver medal was the Chelsea manager, Grant, who looked ashen and did not let Platini, who was in charge of presenting the awards, hang the medal around his neck. He received it directly in his hand.</p>
<p>Then he stepped off the podium. Unlike everyone else, he did not look at the trophy the entire time.</p>
<p>The podium was in the middle of the grandstand. On the right-hand side, it was the area where the Nottingham Forest fans gathered and on the left was the Chelsea fans’ area. The right side was bustling and lively while the left side was in a dead silence.</p>
<p>Grant walked down and halfway through, he looked at the silver medal in his hand and then at the silent and heartbroken Chelsea fans. Following which, he made a move that caused an uproar in the stadium.</p>
<p>He threw the silver medal in his hand into the grandstand! As if it were a stone thrown into a calm lake, it set off a ripple effect, and people raised their hands to scramble for the silver medal. The quiet grandstand became boisterous again.</p>
<p>Tony Twain whistled when he saw this scene .. He could understand Grant’s idea of doing so. He probably felt angry, frustrated but powerless. What more could he do except to express his displeasure in this way?</p>
<p>Did Twain not do the same thing at that time? It even caused a stir after the game. But now he did not need to resort to such extreme measures because he was not resentful at all. He was the victor for two years in a row!</p>
<p>“Grant finally grew a pair at the last minute.” Twain said to Dunn next to him in Mandarin.</p>
<p>Dunn nodded and agreed.</p>
<p>If Grant had come to the stage with a smile on his face, politely received the silver medal and then thanked the senior UEFA officials such as Platini, Twain’s disdain for him would only deepen.</p>
<p>Grant throwing the silver medal was just an interlude. Soon, it was the Nottingham Forest players’ turn to come to the stage to receive the awards. The players came on the stage excitedly to receive the awards, which was no different from winning the title the first time. This was joy from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>George Wood was at the end of the line. He was in charge of picking up the trophy in a while, and Twain was in front of him.</p>
<p>“Did you call your mother?” The two men took the time to chat for a while.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Is she happy?”</p>
<p>“Very happy.”</p>
<p>Twain smiled, “Ah, that’s good. If she’s happy, her health will improved faster … So, George, for your mother’s sake, you’ve got to keep leading this team to win, you know?”</p>
<p>Wood thought these words were strange to listen to, but he still nodded because he also liked to win.</p>
<p>As Twain walked up the steps, the Nottingham Forest fans in the grandstand on the right side reached out to welcome him, as they were the guards of honor with the pikes. They chanted Tony Twain’s name and praised him for winning another title trophy for the team. The others simply had eyes brimming with tears of excitement, too moved for words. In this grandstand, the chill of the rainy night had long been scattered by the fiery red without a trace.</p>
<p>Amid the cheers of the fans, that was how Twain walked up to the podium step by step. Taking over the gold medal that symbolized the championship title from Platini, his expression was not as happy as it was when he walked up.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Mr. Tony Twain.” Platini held out his hand.</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Twain simply shook his hand and left. He did not quite like these UEFA officials, even the star player, Platini, whom he had worshipped for a while.</p>
<p>Platini was a little disappointed by his reaction. He wanted to say a few more words …</p>
<p>George Wood was already standing in front of him. He snapped back to the present and hung the gold medal around Wood’s neck. Then he put his hand on the championship trophy.</p>
<p>The key moment had arrived.</p>
<p>When George Wood took over the trophy from Platini’s hand, the cheers from the fans at the stadium had already reached the climax. But he did not just lift it up. He handed the trophy to Tony Twain who was right next to him.</p>
<p>“You take the other side.”</p>
<p>Twain looked at the serious-looking George Wood and laughed. This mover whom he picked up from the streets, this ignorant teenager who claimed he was England’s best player …</p>
<p>—–I can give you a chance, but it depends on you whether you can become the best player in England, George.</p>
<p>It was as if he had spoken those words yesterday.</p>
<p>Taking the other handle of the trophy, Twain and George Wood hoisted it together.</p>
<p>At this moment, the continuous tide of cheers lapped on the shore, stirring up thousands of ripples and the deafening roar drowned out everything.</p>
<p>“Long live Nottingham Forest! All hail The Double Winner!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 658 - His Majesty the King</p>
<p>When Nottingham Forest landed at Birmingham Airport with the championship trophy, the people that welcomed the team stretched from Birmingham to Nottingham. The motorway turned into a red ribbon, passing on the message that Nottingham Forest had returned home with honor all the way to Nottingham. London’s Heathrow Airport was not chosen because the police did not want the Chelsea fans there to meet the Chelsea team, to clash with the Nottingham Forest fans who would come to meet Nottingham Forest in order to avoid a tragedy from happening.</p>
<p>On this occasion, the BBC television station did a live broadcast. This was the first time since the restructuring of the Champions League that a defending champion had successfully been crowned a champion. This team from England was the pride of all England. They were naturally going to publicize it.</p>
<p>To that end, BBC also planned to produce a two-hour long DVD called [Red Europe], detailing Nottingham Forest’s glorious course this season. The DVD had the invited famous BBC football commentator, John Motson, responsible for the background commentary. After the production was completed, it would be released for sale in which the earnings would be split with the Nottingham Forest Football Club.</p>
<p>This was a small sum of money; which Allan Adams had fought. In addition, the live broadcast of their return this time as well as the celebration party held at the City Ground stadium this evening were also sold. For today’s Nottingham Forest Football Club, even a penny which could be earned would be made.</p>
<p>Tony Twain led the team to win the Champions League and Premier League titles. The broadcasting fees and winning bonuses this season were quite a lot. However, this money was still a drop in the bucket for the massive new stadium construction plan. Allan Adams must continue to look for opportunities to make money.</p>
<p>Everyone was happy on the flight back to Birmingham from Moscow. Allan Adams also did not talk to Twain about the commercial games in the summer. He knew Twain was a bit resistant to the commercialization and did not want to ruin his mood now.</p>
<p>On the way back to Nottingham, everyone was happy, but their vacation time for this summer could be said to be almost zero. That might be the price that must be paid to win the championship.</p>
<p>On May 23rd, the team was dismissed for the season and the players with duties to report for the national teams would travel to their national training camps to take on the UEFA European Championship which would begin in June. By the end of the European Championship at the end of June, they only had a one-week break and would assemble again to travel as far afield as China to start the summer commercial tour in that distant country. And then from China, they would travel to Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia. By the time they returned to England, the FA Community Shield would not be far from them. Following which, it would be the new season of the Premier League and the UEFA Super Cup. The players in the team who had to compete in the Olympic teams also had to participate in the Beijing Olympic Games in August.</p>
<p>Looking at this competition schedule, it could said that the Nottingham Forest players would not have any more breaks from the start of last season until the end of next season.</p>
<p>In fact, one could disregard the fact that Twain had been very happy and excited on the way home. But in actual fact, whenever he had a chance to calm down alone, he would start to think about what Nottingham Forest would do next season.</p>
<p>In truth, he did not quite agree with the commercial tour this summer. If he had a choice, he would have preferred it to be last summer, so that at least the team’s schedule would not have been so tight, and the players would have had plenty of time to rest.</p>
<p>However, Allan told him it was impossible. If it had been last summer, it was the period for the AFC Asian Cup, and East Asia would be focused on the Asian Cup held in four countries in Southeast Asia. It would not have been effective to make their fortune in Asia when there was a lack of attention during that period. And as for next summer? By then, Beckham would end his two-year contract with Nottingham Forest, and they would lose the cash cow. Allan would not have mobilized the team to go to Asia for little profit. Even if he wanted to, perhaps he would not have made much… As a result, after much consideration, only this summer was the most appropriate.</p>
<p>Consequently, Twain asked him. With the UEFA European Championship and the Olympics this summer, would it not be more distracting? Allan said the Olympics were wide-ranging sports games which had little to do with football and there would be no direct conflict. And the timing of the UEFA European Championship was even better. The Asians, whose passion for football were stirred once again by the UEFA European Championship, would increase their desire for football. For Nottingham Forest to go to Asia as The Double Winner during this time, it would simply be … “sending help in the hour of need” as the Chinese saying went.</p>
<p>Therefore, there was no more appropriate time than this year.</p>
<p>Twain was convinced by Allan—what else could he do if he was not persuaded? He was not the owner of the club. The owner had agreed to the matter, so he could only to follow the instructions. But he made a request to Allan that since they would not get a break in the summer and would also face multiple tournaments next season, the team’s First Team had to be strengthened. Several players of sufficient strength needed to be brought in. He was in charge of these candidates.</p>
<p>Allan agreed right away. He said that he could go observe the UEFA European Championship on his own, and he could make his move when he saw good players.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Speaking of the UEFA European Championship, Twain and Dunn were equally busy this summer. After the team was dismissed, they would have a little break before Twain would go to Austria and Switzerland with the BBC television station to be a guest pundit for the BBC’s live broadcast. Since the World Cup, many spectators liked Tony Twain’s style of commentary for the games. He was sharp as nails and quick to draw blood but did not lack a sense of humor. BBC was also in line with the public opinion and once again invited Twain to be a guest commentator. There was no England team this time, so he could speak freely and not be afraid of hurting the national pride. People wanted to hear how he was going to bury those European powerhouses. On the other hand, Dunn would be active in multiple arenas to observe players with potential worth buying by the Forest team. Similarly, busy like Dunn, the Forest team’s ten over full-time football scouts would also be present in the stadium stands for each game.</p>
<p>Having won the Champions League in a row and become The Double Winner, Twain’s pursuit of honor and victory did not stop there. His goal was to create a new dynasty and era in European football like the consecutive five-times UEFA Champions League champion, Real Madrid, the golden era of Inter Milan, the Dutch Trio of AC Milan …</p>
<p>To make Nottingham Forest a representative and symbol of European football during this period.</p>
<p>This goal was quite ambitious, so the efforts must continue. They had to invite the best players to join and continuously achieve victories. To make people feel the desperate oppressive force, maintain ten thousand years of constant stability and show the dominance and arrogance in vying for supremacy. He wanted to engrave this period of Nottingham Forest in history even after one hundred years!</p>
<p>With only a few championships titles under his belt, it was too little to want to stop and live it up …</p>
<p>As for the people who left the team this summer, Twain had largely thought about it. Because the team was in a good shape at the moment, and the results were stable and excellent, so there was no need for a big infusion of players to adjust the team. Nor did he have to deal with his players at low prices in a hurry to get rid of excess baggage. Twain insisted that since they were members of the European champion team, their prices could not be too low. He had to be satisfied before he would nod and agree.</p>
<p>If Chimbonda could be sold at a good price, then Twain would sell him and not do anything to retain him. On the one hand, he was older and did not quite fit with the team’s demands; On the other hand, he and Bendtner made a very bad impression on Twain with the internal brawl.</p>
<p>As for Nicklas Bendtner, the other party involved in the brawl, Twain showed a high degree of tolerance. Did this look a little unfair to Chimbonda? But Bendtner was younger than him and had more potential for development. After van Nistelrooy became too old, the position of the team’s main center forward must belong to Bendtner.</p>
<p>As for Sidwell … Twain did not want him to go. But if the other side had to go, Twain was not in any position to force him to stay. After all, he came to Nottingham Forest for a season, and did not get a chance to play in an important game other than to play in some of the insignificant games. To a player who was only twenty-six years old, the reality was too brutal.</p>
<p>As for Ribéry? He had just been elected the best player in the Champions League final and was even likely to win the UEFA’s Player of the Year. He was already red-hot, but Twain was definitely not going to let him go. No matter what sky-high transfer fees the big clubs offered for Ribéry, he was unmoved. Franck Ribéry was his own men, the core of this team and the main framework. To move him would be equivalent to the demolition of this team. Twain was not going to let this happen in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>There was also Grosso. Twain sincerely intended to sell this Italian “great left back.” The season was over, and Twain must admit that he had made the wrong judgment call in the first place. This man’s most brilliant moment was at the World Cup in Germany. Following which, his career progressively declined. With his traits and style, he was fated not to be the left back that Twain needed. He might as well use Leighton Baines than him.</p>
<p>Grosso certainly did not like British food and weather either. He made slow progress in his English and had some problems communicating with his teammates. In short, this was a loner who was outside the team’s system. While Twain was still a fan, he was misled by Huang Jianxiang whose proclamation of his ability made him famous overseas at that time.</p>
<p>Now was a good time to correct this mistake—Donadoni actually recruited Grosso who did not have more than twenty appearances in Nottingham Forest in a season, to the national team. If he had a chance to play in the UEFA European Championship—Twain believed he would still be better suited to play in the national team—maybe he could find a buyer for him.</p>
<p>As for the others, thanks to the success of Twain’s rotation system this season, most players had been given plenty of appearances. There were no incidents of anyone wanting to leave the team due to conflicts arising from the lack of opportunities for appearances. Twain could lead a complete Nottingham Forest team and continue his campaign for next season.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When the convoy arrived in Nottingham, Twain saw another spectacular sight of “the turn out of the whole town.” They received everyone’s cheers in the city square and the glittery Champions League trophy was placed in front of the crowd. A variety of banners unfurled below, and everyone was cheering. It was as exciting as winning the Champions League for the first time.</p>
<p>A reporter exclaimed as he watched this scene, “If Brian Clough could live to the present and see this scene, I wonder how he would feel?”</p>
<p>At the City Ground stadium, in front of tens of thousands of spectators, the players filled the Champions League trophy with champagne and then took a gulp each. It was really drinking to one’s fill to celebrate a heroic deed with good wine.</p>
<p>After they completed their public appearance in the city square, the team had dinner with the mayor at the mayor’s residence before going to the City Ground stadium for a final grand celebration.</p>
<p>At the dinner party, Mr. Mayor, who was a Nottingham Forest fan, tightly clasped Tony Twain’s hand and was beside himself with excitement.</p>
<p>“This is a remarkable achievement, Tony! A defending champion had not been born since the restructuring of the Champions League! And now this honor belongs to Nottingham and Nottingham Forest! You did a fantastic job! Now that the whole world knows the city of Nottingham again. I have to consider whether to confer you an honorary citizen, Tony.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. But I already am a city resident of Nottingham.” Twain was still more sober headed, as the most exciting period had passed for him.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll erect a statue for you, haha!”</p>
<p>Twain smiled and did not answer. In his view, the mayor was thoroughly drunk. A statue? He did not want it. To erect it only for the birds to poop on top of it? Facing Dunn already gives me a feeling of looking in the mirror every day. Don’t tell me I need another mirror? Wait till I’m dead, Mr. Mayor …</p>
<p>“Cheers, Mr. Mayor!” He changed the subject and raised the glass of champagne in his hand.</p>
<p>“Cheers, Tony! Are there any plans for next season that you can reveal to me in advance?” At the dinner party, Mr. Mayor looked more like a regular Nottingham Forest fan.</p>
<p>“Of course, it will still be more championship titles. Until you’re bored of them, Mr. Mayor.” Twain winked.</p>
<p>“That’s very good! But I’m not going to get bored! There can never be too many titles! Ha ha!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>That night, the City Ground stadium once again became the focus of attention for all Nottingham Forest fans.</p>
<p>In addition to some theatrical performances, the most anticipated highlight was the appearance of the championship team players carrying the two Champions League trophies and Premier League trophy, as well as the EFL Cup trophy.</p>
<p>After a careful planning of this celebration party by the club, they chose to have these trophies appear together. It was also to state clearly an attitude—a full affirmation and commendation of Tony Twain’s results, as well as to publicize these results. They wanted to portray him as the second “Brian Clough” in the club’s history.</p>
<p>The lights of the stadium dimmed, with only a few spotlights coming together to form a circular spot. All the Forest players were enveloped in the beams of light as they ran out of the tunnel, individually receiving the cheers from the fans.</p>
<p>One by one they ran out, and the cheers at the stadium went on and on.</p>
<p>When it was Wes Morgan’s turn as the team’s third captain, he stepped onto the field, taking the EFL Cup, the first trophy won by Twain’s Forest team from the staff’s hands.</p>
<p>The cheers of the fans went up to the next level when they saw the appearance of the first trophy.</p>
<p>Then it was Eastwood and Beckham. The two of them carried the Premier League title trophy and emerged in everyone’s view.</p>
<p>“Thirty years later, we won the topflight championship title again! The English Premier League championship trophy appears at the City Ground for the first time!” John Motson, who was invited to host the entire celebration party, shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>“And what’s next?” He asked.</p>
<p>Nearly thirty thousand fans responded in unison, “UEFA Champions League!!”</p>
<p>Indeed, Franck Ribéry came out with a replica of the Champions League trophy they won last season and waved to the stands. As an important player who helped the team win the UEFA Champions League titles these two seasons, he was awarded the honor of appearing alone with the championship trophy even though he was not the captain.</p>
<p>After Ribéry, it was George Wood’s turn. As the team’s current captain, he made a grand appearance with the other Champions League trophy.</p>
<p>The cheers outside were deafening. Twain stood in the tunnel, waiting to call him to go out.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Kerslake and Dunn ran up from behind, holding a pile of red stuff in their hands.</p>
<p>“Take off your suit.” He shouted as he ran up to Twain.</p>
<p>“Why?” Twain thought it odd.</p>
<p>“Never mind that, just take it off!” If Kerslake was not holding the things in both hands, he wished he could do it himself.</p>
<p>Twain did as he was told and took off his suit. To be honest, he also felt very warm …</p>
<p>But then something that made him feel even warmer came up.</p>
<p>Kerslake shook out the pile of red stuff he had in his hands—apparently it was a king’s red cloak to be draped over the shoulders!</p>
<p>He was dumbfounded when he saw this thing in Kerslake hands.</p>
<p>Next Kerslake did not wait for him to react, and just put the cloak over Twain’s shoulder. It was red edged with white fur and gold pattern. Twain did not know if this was the real deal, but it has a nice feel to it.</p>
<p>“How does it feel?” Kerslake asked with a grin. Before Twain could answer, he tapped his forehead and turned around to take a crown from Dunn’s hands!</p>
<p>Under the white light of the tunnel, the jewel in the crown also shone brightly.</p>
<p>“This isn’t real, is it?” Twain whistled.</p>
<p>“Imitation.” Dunn replied.</p>
<p>Kerslake put the crown upright on Twain’s head before he walked back in satisfaction and appraised him with a tilt of his head as if to admire a piece of art. “Good, it’s got the feel.” He smiled.</p>
<p>“This …” Twain was still puzzled by this.</p>
<p>“How can a king who goes out to receive the adoration from the people, be dressed so shabbily? Kerslake clapped his hands and laughed, “Now you look the part!”</p>
<p>Twain laughed along too, “This is a good idea, I like it.” He accepted the address “king” without any reservations.</p>
<p>“The people in the stands don’t know yet.” Kerslake pointed outside, with a mysterious excitement on his face.</p>
<p>The hem of the long cloak dragged at the back and Twain pulled up the two sides in front of his chest with his hands to prevent this heavy king’s cloak from slipping down. And then he walked out of the tunnel in this way.</p>
<p>John Motson was still also stoking the mood of fans as he announced, “Next, the final person …”</p>
<p>Before he could finish, there were already eager fans who loudly disclosed the answer, “Tony Twain—-”</p>
<p>“YES! Let’s welcome …”</p>
<p>Dressed up like a king, Tony Twain slowly walked out, and the entire stadium exploded with excitement when they saw his getup.</p>
<p>All the men, women and children screamed like crazy and one of the players whistled, “The boss is so cool!”</p>
<p>Twain stood on the sidelines once he walked out of the tunnel. He gripped the collar of the cloak in one hand, grabbed the crown on his head with the other hand and raised them high toward the night sky.</p>
<p>Whether it was the fans in the stands or the players standing in the middle of the field, they all bowed down and raised their arms like they were kowtowing and there were whoops of excitement coming from their mouths.</p>
<p>“… Welcome, Your Majesty!!”</p>
<p>Morton finally shouted out his prepared lines.</p>
<p>Twain calmly accepted this special treatment with his head held high. He was not embarrassed at all. He fully deserved the honor, and thought he was the king of the team.</p>
<p>The four trophies were like the four bright gems in the crown, dazzling and eye-catching, revealing the king’s brilliant feats to the world.</p>
<p>“He really looks like a king …” Kerslake exclaimed as he stood in the tunnel.</p>
<p>“No.” Dunn shook his head and corrected him, “He is a king.”</p>
<p>Twain stood on the field and held the crown high, surrounded by darkness, as if the light beam pierced through the night sky and shone from above to envelope him. Under the light, the crown in his hand emitted dazzling rays, making it hard for people to look directly. He stood in this light, with his head proudly held high and chest puffed out. He looked somewhat dazzling and indomitable.</p>
<p>I have brought glory to my subjects, and I am your king.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 659 - Cat</p>
<p>That crazy night had already become a thing of the past, but the fervor set off by Tony Twain was far from over. As a result of the live broadcast, the footage of Tony Twain dressed as a king was seen by everyone in the country. Whether they liked or disliked him, they were shocked by his action.</p>
<p>Even an arrogant manager like Mourinho would not accept tens of thousands of people bowing down to him in public so naturally. Donning the king’s cloak and a crown on his head, all he lacked was a scepter… Looking at his expression, it was as if all these were things he should enjoy.</p>
<p>England was still a traditional country at the end of the day. Some people in the football circles still could not abide those who departed from established practices. However, this time Tony Twain’s antic was even more exaggerated.</p>
<p>He called himself the king?! Who does he think he is!</p>
<p>Some of the press started bombarding such an arrogant display and subsequently more people joined the ranks of the critics.</p>
<p>“Tony Twain might as well declare independence.”</p>
<p>“With only two UEFA Champions League titles and he wants to ascend the throne? He’s too immature.”</p>
<p>“If a clown like him can be considered a king, then what should Ferguson, Paisley, Shankly, Busby be titled as? God?”</p>
<p>“Nottingham Forest is collectively infected with ‘Tony Twain’s virus’. Granted that he’s crazy himself, but now the entire club and all the Nottingham Forest fans are crazy like him as well, it’s incomprehensible.”</p>
<p>“Look at his revolting face. Does he really think he’s the king? It’s ridiculous. He’s only a clown in our eyes!”</p>
<p>“Dear God, who’s going to save this addled-brain wretch?!”</p>
<p>“There must be something wrong with the world…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“It’s really lively.” In the BBC’s office building, John Motson held a bunch of newspapers and magazines as a meet-and-greet gift for Tony Twain. He pointed to the headlines that censured Twain to the other man with a smile on his face that clearly showed “glee over his misfortune.”</p>
<p>Twain grimaced, “A bunch of poor ignorant bastards…”</p>
<p>“You’ve been quiet in your column, Tony. I don’t think it suits your style very well.” Motson tossed the newspapers aside and chatted with Twain.</p>
<p>BBC 5 was currently preparing to go to Switzerland and Austria to cover the UEFA European Championship this year and the floor was hectic. Motson happened to have a little free time, so he made a joke at Twain’s expense about the recent “King’s Gate” that everyone had hotly hyped.</p>
<p>“What can I say? It was just an exaggerated way of expressing my feelings at that time, but this bunch of idiots took it seriously.”</p>
<p>“You just have to explain clearly, and it’ll be fine…”</p>
<p>“No way.” Twain shook his head and said, “I’m not going to compromise with that bunch of idiotic media. They want to hear my sorry words, but I refuse. I want to make them anxious!”</p>
<p>Motson saw Twain’s lively expression and laughed with his head thrown back.</p>
<p>After his laughter subsided, he wiped away his tears and said, “You’re really a newsmaker. News follow you everywhere… No, you’re the ‘news!’”</p>
<p>“John, can I take this as a compliment to me?” Twain blinked.</p>
<p>“You’re really thick-skinned, Tony.”</p>
<p>“I have to face the disparagement from these media all day long. I can’t survive by being thin-skinned.” Twain was happy to hear John Motson’s comment. He was indeed thick skinned…</p>
<p>Motson nodded and agreed with Twain’s explanation. “But to be honest… I was a little surprised when I saw this king’s spectacle. I thought to myself, if I was pushed to the stage, dressed like that and had to face the barrage of comments, it’s really tough to deal with …”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think so much. Everyone was happy at the time. It’s too dampening to think about it.”</p>
<p>“Hey, your character… is so complicated.” Motson smiled as he shook his head.</p>
<p>Twain felt it was meaningless to talk to Motson about the topic that had been hyped up by the media, so he asked, “Is there anything here for me to do?”</p>
<p>“Here? No. We fly to Basel, Switzerland tomorrow to get ready to report on the opening ceremony in four days.” Motson informed Twain of the plan.</p>
<p>Twain nodded and said, “In that case, I’ll go back to the hotel first.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” It was only when Motson walked Twain to the elevator that he suddenly thought of a matter, “Oh, yes. There’s one thing I want to tell you. It’s rather interesting.”</p>
<p>Twain gave him his full attention.</p>
<p>“Carl Spicer, a reporter for the Daily Telegraph.”</p>
<p>Twain was familiar with this name. He appeared to be a veteran journalist whom he often saw his name in the newspapers. But what did this man have to do with himself?</p>
<p>“He decided to do a rigorous social investigation the form of a questionnaire plus street interviews. He will also interview a lot of famous and unknown media people, commentators, footballers, coaches and club chairmen. It’s a large-scaled plan. The subject of the investigation is—” Looking at Twain, Motson laughed, “[What are your thoughts on this man, Tony Twain?]…. Ha ha!”</p>
<p>At this point he could not contain his laughter and chortled.</p>
<p>Twain did not laugh. He just gave a shrug and said, “Spending taxpayers’ money just to find out if I’m popular or not?”</p>
<p>“Spicer thinks this is an interesting social phenomenon—-a successful football manager who has a bad reputation in the public media and does not receive the recognition that commensurate with his accomplishments at all.”</p>
<p>“He’s lamenting the unfairness on my behalf?”</p>
<p>“No, he just wonders why it is so.”</p>
<p>With a “ding” sound, the elevator door opened in front of the two men.</p>
<p>“Curiosity can kill the cat…” Twain muttered as he walked into the elevator, while Motson waved to him outside, “Don’t forget tomorrow’s flight. You can go directly to the airport.”</p>
<p>“I won’t forget, that is if I’m not killed by all this curiosity tonight….”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha—”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When he returned to the hotel he was staying in, he was held up by two media outlets at the entrance.</p>
<p>“You’ve been waiting here all afternoon because you heard I’m staying here?” Twain looked at the two men in front of him and asked.</p>
<p>He came to London with little fanfare. There was no need to go around publicizing where he stayed as he could be approached by the reporters, which was really… annoying.</p>
<p>A man and a woman from two different media outlets had waited here for an afternoon according to their self-introduction. They want to ask Tony Twain a few questions because they wanted to hear Twain’s response to what the media had said recently.</p>
<p>The devil knows how things have been developing between you two the entire afternoon… The two people looked intimate. They were not from the same media company but acted very close which caused Twain’s imagination to run wild.</p>
<p>“Yes, we have a lot of questions, Mr. Tony Twain…” The male reporter could not wait to ask, but Twain stopped him with a gesture.</p>
<p>“I admire you for being so dedicated to your job, but my time is also my time, so I can’t answer all your questions one by one, Mr. Reporter.” He stood in front of the hotel elevator and pressed the button, waiting for the elevator which was currently on the 18th floor to come down. “See that? I only have time before it gets to the first floor.” He said with a smile as he pointed to the display above the elevator.</p>
<p>The man and the woman met gazes and found it a little difficult. They had managed to get hold of Twain after much difficulty. How could they not ask as many questions as possible to get more sound bites?</p>
<p>“Pick the important questions.” Twain thought of a way for them. Some people in the lobby had already glanced over here and Twain did not want to stand here to viewed like a monkey.</p>
<p>This time the female reporter stepped forward and cleared her throat, “What do you think of Grant throwing the silver medal at the awards ceremony, Mr. Twain?”</p>
<p>“That’s his freedom which is none of my business. The medal was given to him, so he could do whatever he wanted. No one has the right to say anything to him.” This time, Twain stood on Grant’s side.</p>
<p>“As to…” Twain’s tone had been very unfriendly toward the reporters, so they had to weigh their words, “that ‘King’s Gate’ incident…”</p>
<p>This was the media’s abbreviated term for the incident whereby Twain dressed as a king in his appearance. Like his original “rape-gate” incident, Twain felt that these reporters had not grown these few years, and still quite sub-standard when it came to giving names. He knew what these reporters wanted to ask, so he replied first, “I have nothing to say. It’s my freedom to wear whatever I want to the celebration party. It’s nobody’s business. I don’t need to hold a press conference to explain it just because I wore something that few people would wear. Would you go around explaining it to other people just because you’re wearing a ‘Hello Kitty’ underpants today?” Twain stared at the male reporter and asked. That man reflexively glanced down…</p>
<p>“The Queen’s lead singer, Mercury, did the same thing after their London concert. And I don’t see it causing a ruckus? And yet you kicked up a big fuss to ask me what happened… How do I know what’s going on?” Speaking of this, Twain became angry.</p>
<p>It’s really not easy to be a public figure. Even getting dressed up would invite criticism … Everyone should just f**k off!</p>
<p>“Ah!” The female reporter caught a glimpse of the number above that had jumped to level four. She gave a yelp and threw out another question, “Carl Spicer plans to do a survey on your popularity and intends publish the study after its conclusion. He said that if it were to be published successfully, he would send you an autographed copy. What do you think?”</p>
<p>With a “ding” sound, the elevator door opened next to Twain, and the passengers inside were somewhat surprised to see two reporters holding tape recorders and small notebooks. But when they saw who the interviewee was, they all understood.</p>
<p>There was no business of concern to them here. Close proximity with this guy, Tony Twain meant trouble, so it was better to stay further away… One by one, they quickly walked away from the side.</p>
<p>With one foot into the elevator, Twain turned to the two reporters and said with a straight face, “I feel this is quite meaningless.”</p>
<p>With that, he dashed into the elevator and the door closed between him and the reporters.</p>
<p>In the empty elevator, Twain took a slight breath. But he still dare not completely relax. He knew that the elevator also had a surveillance camera. Now he was known nationwide, he could not rule out that someone would sell the private recording in the elevator to make money. Real celebrities did not have the slightest space of their own and were under the media’s watch at all times and everywhere. This kind of life was really tiring…</p>
<p>He weakly leaned against the wall and wanted a rest. But he caught himself only a second later and left the wall to stand straight in the elevator again. He did not want anyone to see his feeble side, not even for a second’s respite.</p>
<p>Looking up at the camera on the ceiling of the elevator and surrounded by icy steel panels, Twain felt like a cat in a sealed cage. The air felt thinner. Perhaps he would first die of suffocation one day before he could die of old age.</p>
<p>That’s too ridiculous… The king of Nottingham Forest is in fact a cat that was suffocated?! Twain grinned at the camera.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When Twain flew to Switzerland the next day with the BBC 5 crew, including Motson, his partner, Dunn, had already been there for almost a week.</p>
<p>This time for the UEFA European Championship, Nottingham Forest sent out all the scouts, half of whom were responsible for tracking the performances of the Forest team’s existing players in their national teams and ensuring their conditions in order to prepare for the new season. The other half were to observe the non-Forest players who had the potential to perform well. The young and older were all under consideration.</p>
<p>The people in charge of all this work were Dunn and Kerslake. Dunn led the group of scouts who observed the new players, while Kerslake led the unit that tracked the Forest players. The two men had a clear division of labor and would eventually put together all the information to hand it over to Tony Twain after. It was up to him to decide who they should buy and who to continue to investigate…</p>
<p>After the UEFA European Championship, the scouts still could not take a break. They would be going to China to continue their tour of the Olympics to find younger and more promising talented players. This time, their focus was mainly on countries outside Europe.</p>
<p>Once all the players’ profile came out, they would then deposited in the world’s player library specially produced by Sports Interactive for the Forest team, which could be easily transferred when needed. Twain’s ambition was so great that from now on, he would slowly gather young talent from all over the world. In this way five, ten, fifteen, twenty years later, Nottingham Forest would have the resources to establish itself in this cruel world: an excellent and loyal to the team unit under his personal command. The glory of Nottingham Forest would never be just a two-season meteor, nor a comet that only showed its brilliance once every few decades, but a star like the sun—its eternal presence, forever glowing and radiating warm, lasting five billion years.</p>
<p>For everyone at Nottingham Forest, being busy would be the only theme this summer. Everyone was occupied.</p>
<p>This would be the first time since he met Shania that Twain and Shania would not spent their holidays together. Shania was busy filming, studying and doing runway shows. Whereas Twain was busy as a pundit for BBC during the UEFA European Championship and taking the team on its Asian tour. It could already be next year when they had a chance to catch their breath and miss each other…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 659.1 - The Busy Summer Begins</p>
<p>After this UEFA European Championship, Twain reaffirmed one thing yet again—in addition to being suited to be a manager, there was another job that fitted him.</p>
<p>A guest pundit for a football match.</p>
<p>When Twain was still just an ordinary Chinese football fan, every time he watched the televised games and listened to those incongruous, rubbish, unintelligible, amateurish and insouciant commentaries from the guest commentators and pundits pulled from the other industries, he felt that he could do better than those people. However, he could do nothing except to silently curse in his mind at that time. Whenever he watched the games, he still had to endure such substandard commentary time and time again unless he turned off the sound in the television. But he would not be able to hear the shouts coming from the stadiums. What would be the point of watching the games live then?</p>
<p>All was well now. He did not have to put up with that noise anymore, because… he could make his own noise!</p>
<p>During the period when the UEFA European Championship was in progress, an audience called in to protest against Tony Twain’s style of commentary, arguing that his caustic style and language was a noise to him.</p>
<p>While as a fan, Twain did not think that once he really became a guest pundit, there would be people who thought that his commentary was garbage.</p>
<p>But now he did not have to worry about the opinions of the audience. John Motson divulged to him that the top brass at BBC was happy to see “a famous popular TV host” like Twain unleashed on live television every game, because it attracted plenty of eyeballs, generated ample topics, and brought in abundant advertising dollars….</p>
<p>Twain’s commentary was always so biting that Motson found it unacceptable at times. He could relentlessly criticize the star players and managers during the live games and be totally… vicious with his words. If the target of his criticism were to hear his commentary in person, he would not hesitate to pounce on him and beat him to the ground.</p>
<p>Where there was people who hated it, naturally there were some people who liked it. Some people were extremely fond of listening to Twain’s commentary. They even left comments on the BBC’s website that if the BBC dared to change to another commentator, they would call every day to harass them until BBC brought him back.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not necessarily that Twain’s comments were more profound and original than the other experts. The key was that his gift of gab allowed him to bring the game to live and he was very good at grasping the interesting highlights in the games, which always entertain the audience. It was fitting to say that Twain turned a football game into a live talk show.</p>
<p>The BBC also seized the opportunity to sign a long-term contract with Twain during the UEFA European Championship. In the contract, BBC 5 hired Tony Twain as a special commentator for the television station. Whenever the England national team played, he would temporarily put aside his position as the Nottingham Forest manager and switched to be a television commentator. The contractual relationship between the two parties would continue until the end of the 2010 World Cup, which could be renewed depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>Besides being a brand ambassador for Armani, this was another source of income for Twain. Even though it could not be compared to Armani’s endorsement fees, even a small mosquito could be considered meat. Not only he could do a job he liked, he could also earn money. Such a good thing was hard to come by.</p>
<p>Back at the UEFA European Championship itself, this tournament caused Twain to repeatedly exclaim that a football was round and that anything was possible on the football field.</p>
<p>The strong starts of Italy and the Netherlands had brought them an early exit instead; Russian football had signs that it would repeat its glory period again. After having just beaten the Netherlands, it lost to Spain immediately; the German tank had been as stable as ever, but still lost due to the passionless and poor Ballack who followed up his post-2002 period to become “a three-time runner-up” again. (Chelsea lost to Tottenham Hotspur in the EFL Cup final and finished runner-up); In the end, it was unsurprising that the well-deserved Spain won because throughout the tournament, the only team that had not made any mistakes and been consistent, both defensively and offensively, was Spain. It would have been an injustice if such a team did not win the championship. Casillas continued his excellent form from Real Madrid, while Villa vented all his frustrations at the UEFA European Championship due to his unhappy time at Valencia. After winning all six games, Spain was back on top in Europe after forty-four years.</p>
<p>Although Italy was eliminated early, Twain was pleased that Grosso’s performance in the national team was much better than his performance in the Forest team. What looked to be a fall in his price could now be bullish due to this UEFA European Championship. It was during his time as a commentator at the UEFA European Championship that the French and Italian clubs had already inquired Nottingham Forest if Grosso could be sold.</p>
<p>Grosso was just a little surprise. The biggest surprise came from the Russian core player, Arshavin. Having been shown a red card in the last game of the UEFA European Championship qualifying round, he did not play in the first two games during the group stage and Russia’s results had not been good. Especially from their crushing 0:4 defeat to Spain, there seemed to be no hope for this team. Twain, who was in charge of commentary for that game, watched Akinfeev pick up the ball from the net repeatedly and shook his head. The game caused Nottingham Forest’s second goalkeeper to almost lost his face. The responsibility for the rapid concede of the goal did not lie with him, but people would only focus on the hapless position of the goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Following which, Russia narrowly beat Greece1-0 in the second round of the group stage and finally retained the hope of making the cut out of the group stage. It also planted the seed for Arshavin’s comeback.</p>
<p>Arshavin made a comeback in the third round of the group stage and led Russia to a clean 2-0 defeat of the Nordic powerhouse, Sweden. The Russian team’s performance for this game turned everything on its head as compared to the first time they lost badly to Spain. The lineup was almost the same. Just because there was Arshavin, Russia’s attack was more threatening and stronger in its push forward.</p>
<p>After qualifying for the knockout stage, their 3-1 defeat of Netherlands was almost down to a one-man performance by Arshavin. The superior Dutch team which was indomitable in the group stage was ineffective when up against the diminutive Arshavin. Their defenders basically could not defend against Arshavin’s strike on both wings. Unless the Dutchmen used a foul, his speed and technique forced to them to let him pass.</p>
<p>This game made Twain proud and vindicated. With such a performance from his player, it showed his foresight for bringing in Arshavin a year ago.</p>
<p>This match was dubbed as the “Nottingham Forest Derby” by the local Nottingham media, with two Russian players and three Netherlands players in the starting lineup. In addition to the excellent Arshavin and Akinfeev, van Nistelrooy also received van der Vaart’s assist in the game to score the equalizer in the final minute, dragging the suspense of the game into overtime. Only the poor van der Sar became a sacrificial victim. He had to pick up the ball from the net three times, especially two goal concedes in overtime, which completely crushed the Dutchman’s spirit.</p>
<p>No matter which team was the ultimate winner, this game delighted Twain as it proved to the world that Nottingham Forest’s players were the best and that The Double won this season was definitely not based on dumb luck.</p>
<p>Our players have the ability!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>While Twain passed judgement on the games at BBC 5, Dunn and Kerslake also had results in their work. Dunn and the scouting team he led, finally compiled a huge list of up to thirty players with not only their names but with the most detailed information about each player and even the video of his games at this European Championship.</p>
<p>Twain did not have to do anything else. He just had to read this report and completely understand the information about the players and their performances at the UEFA European Championship.</p>
<p>Benzema was perhaps the most famous player of late among these players. Dunn thought highly of this French center forward’s ability as well, but he was the first to be ruled out of Twain’s selection list. It was not that Twain did not appreciate his ability, but it was for a very a simple reason — he was a Lyon player. Lyon’s boss was a notorious miser in European football, best known for selling his players at high prices. Now that all of Europe’s big clubs were watching Benzema, Aulas would not accept offers of less than fifty million euros. And what Nottingham Forest lacked the most now was money…</p>
<p>Twain would also not consider Huntelaar for similar reasons. Moreover, Twain felt that the team’s current four forwards configuration was reasonable. He did not think that there was a need to add a new striker. Even if one needed to be introduced, it was simply to introduce the very young strikers and put them in the youth team to be trained, or on loan to train. The First Team did not need to bring in any strikers at the moment.</p>
<p>In fact, Nottingham Forest mainly needed to bring in new players in the rear half of the field for the new season. If the right candidate could be found for the defensive midfielder position, Twain would consider it. Sidwell’s agent had already called Twain during the European Championship, hoping that the club would agree to Sidwell’s search of a new owner. After Twain made a pretense of trying to urge him to stay, he agreed in principle to Sidwell’s switch of allegiance to a new patron. But he must be satisfied with the price.</p>
<p>If Sidwell left, the issue of finding a substitute for George Wood would be put back on the agenda.</p>
<p>Sun Jihai was indeed a utility player, but he was too old, and his form declined rapidly. He was barely able to play as a full back. Twain would not feel assured to hand an important position such as the defensive midfielder to him.</p>
<p>For some well-known reasons, George Wood’s substitute was very difficult to find. But Twain was already thinking about a solution—the team’s goal for next season was still multiple tournaments. This time, Twain intended to strive for the English FA Cup which he had never won. That meant that Nottingham Forest would face a tough competition in three tournaments starting in January. In that way, a rotation system was a must, and this time Twain planned to put Wood on rotation as well. After all, it was dangerous to place such an important position solely on Wood’s shoulder. What if Wood was suspended? If there was a good defensive midfielder who could share this pressure, Twain could deploy with more ease in the face of multiple tournaments.</p>
<p>If it was possible, Twain hoped to have the team try to manipulate the transfer of the Spanish youngster, Rubén de la Red. He was keen on De la Red’s ability to control the pace of attack and could be a useful supplement to George Wood. At this UEFA European Championship, de la Red cleverly seized his chance and scored a crucial goal in his first game for the Spanish national team. He played remarkably. Of course, de la Red was only an option. If he wanted to focus more on the defense, there was another defensive midfielder who “graduated from the same school” — Javi García.</p>
<p>One of these two Real Madrid discarded players could transfer to Nottingham Forest in the summer — it was to be noted that it was a possibility. Twain was not confident of whether Real Madrid and Getafe were willing to let go of those players. The people at Real Madrid were not blind either, plus the performances of these two young players last season were well known.</p>
<p>There was also a defensive midfielder who played outstandingly at the UEFA European Championship which could be considered. He was the Swiss national footballer and the twenty-four-year-old, Gökhan Inler, who played in Udinese Calcio. He had a strong view of the big picture, exquisite technical skills, and was strong in defense. He was an excellent defensive midfielder from every angle who could replace George Wood’s position in some games. Furthermore, he did not suddenly become famous by relying on the UEFA European Championship. Twain did not have to worry that he was just a shooting star. Because Italy’s venerated media [La Gazzetta dello Sport], once named Inler as “the best deal in Serie A for the summer.”</p>
<p>Cannavaro’s injury during tackle became Giorgio Chiellini’s opportunity to make his mark. His performance in the European Championships was the biggest discovery of the Italy national team. But… with his lesson learnt with Grosso, Twain no longer approved of the Italian players and would not consider bringing in Chiellini, even though the Italian youngster could play as a center back and left back.</p>
<p>The right back, Chimbonda was certain to leave. Even if he did not want to, Twain would make it clear that this French black man was not in his plans. So, to rely solely on Rafinha and Sun Jihai, whose form had declined sharply, was clearly not enough to meet the team’s requirements for a right back competing in the multiple tournaments. Looking for a good right back was imminent.</p>
<p>Twain already had a goal—the Portugal national team’s as well as Porto’s main right back, José Bosingwa. Nottingham Forest would certainly face its arch-rivals Chelsea and Manchester United in the battle for Bosingwa. To that end, Twain was willing to stake the entire transfer budget this summer to take Bosingwa. If he did not bolster the right back position, then Nottingham Forest’s right side would be buried with a ticking bomb that would implode at an indefinite time this new season.</p>
<p>On the left back side, due to Grosso’s poor performance, Twain was reacquainted with Leighton Baines. He believed that he was still very useful in a purely defensive assignment and did not have to clear him out of the team so quickly. Therefore, the club intended to offer Baines a new contract extension until 2011.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s center back area was filled with talent and basically did not need any new players.</p>
<p>Pepe’s performance with the Portugal national team had been solid. His goal after a long-distance run in the first game was amazing. Twain was certainly not going to let him go.</p>
<p>Piqué was selected for the Spain national team but did not get a chance to play. He only witnessed a major tournament and won a championship title, which only benefitted his growth without any harm. The only trouble was… It was rumored that after two seasons of pain, Barcelona intended to focus on reshaping their defense and learning from its arch-rival, Real Madrid. And their target was Gerard Piqué, who had a Barça pedigree—which was pure. Twain would not agree to Piqué’s departure, but… Twain was a little worried about Piqué’s thoughts. After all, he was from La Masia. It was not clear whether he still felt that playing for Barça was the only goal of his career …</p>
<p>Kompany was a substitute for Pepe or Piqué at the Forest team, but he had improved significantly and had the talent to occasionally play as the defensive midfielder. Twain regarded this youngster as important. If… just in case, Piqué was determined to respond to Barcelona’s call, Twain did have to worry too much because he still had Kompany.</p>
<p>As for Ayala, his experience was still most needed by the team… Obviously, if there was a team interested in him and wanted to pay to buy him, Twain would not force him to stay. After all, Ayala did not have many chances left to contribute to the Forest team.</p>
<p>As for a player like Wes Morgan, he did not need to give him too many chances to play. The occasional appearance was enough. His main task was not to help the team win on the pitch, but to maintain the balance in the locker room, ensure the integrity of the Nottingham Forest lineup, and … help the team successfully pass the pre-season registration to qualify for the Champions League.</p>
<p>Basically, this was Twain’s plan of action for new players this summer. All kinds of transfers in and out would generally be based on this plan. He would keep the team’s main frame and repair or adjust some small details, which would not only ensure the degree of rapport within the team, but also to add fresh blood to strengthen their abilities.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest would be highly anticipated in the new season…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 660: Poach and Be Poached From</p>
<p>While Twain was racking his brains to poach from other teams, his players were also being poached by others at the same time.</p>
<p>Just days after the Champions League final, news came from the Spanish side that Real Madrid had targeted Nottingham Forest star player, Franck Ribéry. And unlike the rumors in the first half of the year, the Real Madrid club was for real this time.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>This summer, Real Madrid had two key targets whom they wanted to bring in, one of whom was the Portuguese, Cristiano Ronaldo, who had scored forty-one goals in a season at Manchester United and had become the Premier League’s top scorer this season. While the other was this year’s Champions League’s Player of the Year, Franck Ribéry.</p>
<p>Both men were currently the star players with the most appeal in the football world. The nature of Real Madrid was to pursue the best players in the world and then have them all play for the best club in the world.</p>
<p>Whether it was first Di Stefano or later on Figo, Zidane, Ronaldo and Beckham, the century-old Real Madrid was never an ordinary team.</p>
<p>They could develop the superstars themselves, or they could make a move to poach from the other teams. This move was detested by people—who could be willing to part with the star players that one painstakingly groomed and were eventually stolen away by Real Madrid with money?</p>
<p>Real Madrid’s current president, Calderón, was able to successfully come into power by relying on “three promises”: he promised to the fans that he would bring in the Brazilian Kaka, the Portuguese Ronaldo and the Dutchman Robben if he were elected as the new president.</p>
<p>Now he had made good on that promise of Robben, but he had been strongly rebuffed by AC Milan in the pursuit of Kaka. The relationship of both clubs had even broken down at one point.</p>
<p>After a summer of attempts, Calderón realized that now was not the best time to bring in Kaka. Therefore, they shifted their target this summer. Cristiano Ronaldo’s breakout this season had made him a hot favorite, but the only club who really dared to take him on was Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Real Madrid was already in the touch with Cristiano Ronaldo’s agent, Mendes long before the season was even over to suss out the player’s own wishes. This was Real Madrid’s usual style of poaching players—using the players to threaten the clubs they played for.</p>
<p>Ronaldo’s response had been positive. He wanted to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid. On the one hand, this transfer would provide him with a better package. On the other hand, he would have the opportunity to continue his dream of impacting the Champions League. He had been in such excellent form this season but Manchester United failed in both tournaments which left him disappointed.</p>
<p>After learning of Ronaldo’s idea, Real Madrid blatantly make an offer to Manchester United for fifty million euros.</p>
<p>However, Real Madrid encountered a strong rival—Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
<p>“No matter how much money you offer, I won’t sell Cristiano. He is a Manchester United player and under contract with Manchester United. He is very happy at Manchester United and completely has no reason to go to Real Madrid. I’m not going to let him go.”</p>
<p>In fact, the Manchester United Football Club hoped to sell Ronaldo. After all, the American boss wanted to make money. But at Manchester United, Ferguson’s position was almost unshakable, and his voice represented the Manchester United’s voice. At the same time, in order to convince everyone on the surface that there were no differences and contradictions within Manchester United, the club must also adopt a unified stance as Ferguson.</p>
<p>Real Madrid assumed that Manchester United thought the offer was inadequate and began to progressively increase the amount, but Ferguson was still adamant. Feeling bothered, the Manchester United club angrily stated, “You want to take the Portuguese? One hundred million euros!”</p>
<p>Did that scare Real Madrid away?</p>
<p>Real Madrid really started to raise a transfer fee of one hundred and forty million euros and prepared to get the world-class star player they desired.</p>
<p>Manchester United might have underestimated Real Madrid’s finances, but Real Madrid also underestimated the obstinacy of Ferguson, this old man. He publicly stated, “Even if they (Real Madrid) does come up with one hundred million euros, Ronaldo is still not for sale!”</p>
<p>Real Madrid, who had previously been successful in every deal in the transfer market, really hit a snag. Ronaldo’s transfer was temporarily suspended as the UEFA European Championship was imminent. Ronaldo had publicly stated that he did not want to talk about his future next season at this time.</p>
<p>In this way, Real Madrid set its sights on another player comparable to Cristiano Ronaldo— Franck Ribéry of Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>In terms of technical skills, Ribéry’s technique was not as good or crowd-pleasing as Ronaldo’s. But he was more practical and powerful at breakthroughs. He had excellent scoring ability and was an all-rounder player who could play in the flanks and middle. Such a player was what Schuster really wanted. Cristiano Ronaldo was just what the club’s top echelon wanted the team to bring in, while Schuster wanted Ribéry who was more suited to the team’s tactics and comprehensive than C. Ronaldo. In Schuster’s view, Ribéry was better than C. Ronaldo on one point and that was, his ability to organize attacks in the front field. Even though van der Vaart was at Nottingham Forest, Ribéry’s ability to organize attacks displayed during the offense was still impressive.</p>
<p>As a result, when he saw that the development with Ronaldo was slow to progress, Schuster immediately strongly recommended the acquisition of Ribéry to the top. This candidate was also considered good in Calderón’s mind. When Nottingham Forest knocked Real Madrid out of the top four in two rounds, this high-flying club chairman was impressed with Ribéry’s performance.</p>
<p>In this way, Ribéry once again became Real Madrid’s main target, in concurrent with Ronaldo’s offer.</p>
<p>These two men’s transfer deals were not to be underestimated. There was more to it than meets the eye behind them. Calderón demanded results on both sides. Cristiano Ronaldo’s transfer was handed over to the club’s director of football, Mijatović to be in charge while the finance director, Jose Angel Sanchez had the authority to preside over Ribéry’s transfer deal.</p>
<p>To look further in-depth into this, it became clear when one looked at the relationship between these two men. Sanchez and Mijatović were sworn enemies. When Calderón once again put Sanchez from Florentino’s era in an important position, it originated from his distrust of Mijatović. How could Mijatović have any good opinions of Sanchez, a man who came to separate his power?</p>
<p>This arrangement could also be said to be the result of Calderón’s checks and balances on both sides. He separately arranged very important tasks to the two men and see who could complete the job well in the end. Whoever did well would naturally obtain the president’s trust further. If they did not complete well… it would be tough time at the top echelon of Real Madrid. Consequently, the two men were bound to strive and give it all to sign these two players for Real Madrid. Once Ronaldo and Ribéry transferred to Real Madrid, it would be the most sensational transfer in the world this summer.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Against such a backdrop, the Nottingham Forest Football Club received a fax for an official offer from Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Twain was in Switzerland as a guest pundit for the competition and was busy working every day. Because a commentator could not just go up and open his mouth to speak. He also had to collect a lot of information and intelligence before the games in order to be able to speak with ease during the games.</p>
<p>Evan called him and told him that Real Madrid wanted to buy Ribéry. He almost rejected the offer reflexively.</p>
<p>“No way!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to hear how much they offer?” Evan asked with a smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t care how much they offered. I’m not selling!” Discussing the possibility of Ribéry’s transfer actually offended Twain. “Real Madrid thinks they have the money to collect the best players in the world to play for them? Well, let me tell them that money is not everything!”</p>
<p>“Fifty million euros is not a small amount, Tony.”</p>
<p>“Manchester United declared that they can’t take Ronaldo away for less than one hundred million. We can also announce that they can’t have Ribéry for less than one hundred and fifty million euros.”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me we can sell him if they do make that offer?”</p>
<p>Twain was silent for a moment. He knew what Evan was after, and he knew Evan was his boss, so he gave Evan face and said, “If they do come up with one hundred and fifty million euros just to buy Ribéry, I’ll promise to let him go!”</p>
<p>At the same time, he thought in his mind, “There’s no way Real Madrid will bear to offer one hundred and fifty million!”</p>
<p>Evan was certainly aware that Twain was giving a tactfully rejection with these words. No club in the world was crazy enough to offer a player a price of one hundred and fifty million euros. He smiled and said, “Well, we’ll just refuse in the name of the club.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your understanding, Evan. After all, we’re not at the point yet to make money by selling players, are we? Selling the core players will greatly affect the team’s performance…”</p>
<p>Evan interrupted Twain, “Of course I know, Tony.”</p>
<p>This call worried Twain a little. It was certainly not about his relationship with Evan, but about Ribéry. It looked like Real Madrid was really going to make a move on Ribéry…</p>
<p>There were few players in the world who could resist the temptation of a powerhouse club. Once Real Madrid really reached out to Ribéry, what should Nottingham Forest use to resist?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>It was at this point that Twain “coincidentally” received a call from Ribéry’s agent, Bruno Heiderscheid.</p>
<p>“What a coincidence that you call at this time, Mr. Heiderscheid.” Twain’s tone revealed the sarcasm that any fool could sense.</p>
<p>“Ha, Mr. Twain, since you know why I called, I’ll get right to the point. To be honest, I want the club to reconsider the contract with Ribéry.”</p>
<p>To be frank, it was about getting a raise. Twain understood this. For Ribéry’s current position, a weekly salary of eighty thousand was indeed low. If he had a rich boss like Abramovich, he could pay Ribéry two hundred thousand a week in one breath. But did he have that much? He did not so he was unable to.</p>
<p>“The club has been thinking about this matter and we are very sincere. But the last time we offered a pay of a hundred thousand a week which you wouldn’t agree, Mr. Heiderscheid.” So, you see, the problem did not lie with our side.</p>
<p>Laughter came from the other end of the line, “Mr. Twain, don’t you think that one hundred thousand is too little for Ribéry’s contribution and fame?”</p>
<p>This time Twain did not get angry. He knew that anger would not help solve the problem.</p>
<p>He asked calmly, “So how much do you think is appropriate, Mr. Heiderscheid?”</p>
<p>“One hundred and fifty.”</p>
<p>Even if Twain had better decorum, he would not be able to contain his anger when he heard this, not to mention that he was not a refined and courteous gentleman.</p>
<p>“I think, Mr. Heiderscheid. You shouldn’t be an agent. It’s a waste of your talent. It’d better if you directly rob a bank.” He gnashed his teeth as he spoke.</p>
<p>The last time the two men were in a deadlock with their negotiations. Heiderscheid’s condition was a weekly salary of one hundred thousand, which Twain did not accept, not to mention one hundred and fifty thousand.</p>
<p>“Please remain calm, Mr. Twain. I think this condition is very reasonable. Given the situation, it makes perfect sense to stay a world-class player with one hundred and fifty thousand.” Heiderscheid was not angry with Twain’s sarcastic remarks. But his calm tone offended Twain’s ears, making him extremely annoyed, and his anger was escalating…</p>
<p>“Ha, reasonable?” Twain laughed angrily, “You’re telling me that one hundred and fifty thousand weekly salary is very reasonable?! You go and ask around. What’s Ronaldo’s weekly salary in Manchester United? One hundred and twenty thousand! What right do you have to talk about reasonability in front of me? The owner of Nottingham Forest Football Club is not a Russian oligarch with money and nowhere else to spend, nor is he a powerful American backer! Do you think it’s reasonable to ask for a one hundred and fifty thousand weekly salary in the current financial situation, Mr. Bruno Heiderscheid?”</p>
<p>“Cool down, Mr. Twain.”</p>
<p>“I’m motherf**king cooler than an iceberg.” Twain still could not hold back the foul language.</p>
<p>“I understand the club wants Ribéry to stay, but don’t you think you should show some sincerity in return?”</p>
<p>It was the same schtick again. Twain smirked, “You singularly emphasized the obligations of the club, but ignored the loyalty of the player. You wanted one hundred and fifty thousand weekly salary the moment you opened your mouth. Is this supposed to be a scare tactic? Is this the way to start a favorable negotiation? To put it bluntly, you want Ribéry to transfer to Real Madrid so that you have your cut, right? Mr. Ten Percent.”</p>
<p>This time Twain did not even bother using his name. He just used this sarcastic code name.</p>
<p>“I just thought we analyze this calmly and that is the truth, Mr. Twain. Either the club increases Ribéry’s salary to his satisfaction to keep him, or he will have to leave the Forest team to a team that can meet his small demand.” Heiderscheid’s tone was getting colder and colder.</p>
<p>When Twain heard this man utter this sentence without any emotion, he really wanted to shout into the receiver, “F**K YOU! You scumbag!”</p>
<p>But what he opened his mouth, he just took a deep breath to calm his agitation.</p>
<p>He did not know what Allan would think of this matter, but he decided to grit his teeth and make some concessions. He must make Ribéry stay. He was one of the team’s core offensive players. The team’s tactical routine was much richer with him around.</p>
<p>“One hundred and twenty thousand and that’s the maximum we can accept. With the current situation at the club, I think it is enough to show our fullest sincerity.”</p>
<p>“No, one hundred and fifty thousand…”</p>
<p>Twain swung his hand and smashed his phone. The sturdy-looking Nokia cell phone crashed into the opposite wall with a bang and smashed into smithereens across the carpet.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 661 - The Mallorca Holiday</p>
<p>There had not been any further developments with the matter of Ribéry’s new contract since Twain’s brutal rejection of Heiderscheid’s bid that day. Twain’s suppressed his anger and anxiety in rushing back to Nottingham to deal with this mess, so that he could complete his commentary job for BBC 5. Feeling furious, his words became more vicious. As a result, the poor Germans were severely ridiculed by Twain in the commentator’s box due to their poor performance in the final.</p>
<p>During this time, there had been more and more news in the media about Real Madrid’s pursuit of Ribéry and Cristiano Ronaldo. Like Ronaldo, Real Madrid was very good at using all the factors available to pave the way for their transfer campaign, and public opinion was a very important tool.</p>
<p>Twain saw Heiderscheid again, but it was only in the newspapers and television news.</p>
<p>Wearing sunglasses under the bright sunshine of Madrid, Spain, he enigmatically told the reporters that he had only come to Spain for a holiday.</p>
<p>Only a fool would believe that he was really here on holiday.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a few days later, he came forward to voluntarily accept an interview from [Marca] and talked about Real Madrid’s pursuit of Ribéry.</p>
<p>“… Yes, I know Real Madrid is interested in Franck. To be honest, although Franck and I both want to continue to stay at Nottingham Forest since he became famous in that team, there is no player in the world who can remained unmoved when faced with an invitation from Real Madrid… You know what I mean? That’s what I mean. Real Madrid is the best club in the twentieth century. It is the dream of many professional players to play in a team like that…”</p>
<p>The meaning of his remarks could not be clearer. He admitted that he had been in contact with Real Madrid, and also implied that Ribéry wanted to join Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Seeing this news, Twain could not sit still any longer. Before flying back to the United Kingdom from Austria, he hastened to call Ribéry at the airport.</p>
<p>“Franck, I think we should talk alone.”</p>
<p>Ribéry was on holiday to soothe his “injured heart” from the UEFA European Championship. His French team returned home during the group stage. The UEFA Champions League’s Player of the Year and European Footballer of the Year ended his bid for the national team honor early, which was a blow to him.</p>
<p>“But, boss… I’m on vacation now…” Ribéry’s voice wavered. Yes, it “wavered” like a signal lamp in the wind and rain. Sometimes it was clear and sometimes it was indistinct.</p>
<p>“I can go to you. Don’t worry, I won’t ask you money for the air ticket. Ha ha!” Twain tried his best to make his voice sound normal and even deliberately make a joke. He asked, “Where are you currently on vacation?”</p>
<p>The other end of the line was silent for a moment, and Ribéry’s voice came again, “Mallorca.”</p>
<p>This name stumped Twain a little. He was not keen on travel and someone who was familiar with all the tourist attractions in the world. But even he knew which country the name of this place belonged to. Mallorca, which translated to “Mǎ luò kǎ” in China, was also the name of a La Liga team.</p>
<p>So that means Ribéry is in Spain?</p>
<p>At this time, under such a context and this place … Twain could not help thinking there was more to this.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll go look for you.” Twain made the decision that some things could only be made clear in person and face-to-face communication also helped Twain know what Ribéry really thought. If he wanted to convince someone, it was more effective to communicate in person than to talk over the phone.</p>
<p>This time, Ribéry was silent for a long while and then he said, “Boss, you have been busy for more than a month. It’s better for you to take a break first …”</p>
<p>Twain smiled, “I’m not busy at all. Admonishing people on TV is not considered busy. Besides, Mallorca is a well-known tourist spot. It’s just nice that I can take a break where you are.”</p>
<p>This time Ribéry no longer had any reason to refuse.</p>
<p>“Well, boss, since you’re coming, I’ll pick you up at the airport.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When the UEFA European Championship came to an end, Twain did not go straight back to England with Motson and the others. Instead, he booked a direct flight from Austria to Mallorca, Spain. Then he bought a few brightly colored print short-sleeved shirts as well as shorts and a straw hat from a local shop. After he wore the ensemble head-to-toe, he looked like a tourist on vacation.</p>
<p>When he appeared at the airport in this outfit, the British reporters who had planned to follow BBC television back were surprised.</p>
<p>“Isn’t the team going to re-group, Mr. Twain? Where are you heading off to?”</p>
<p>“Going on a holiday to rest and relax!” Twain said with a smile.</p>
<p>“Can I ask you where you’re going?”</p>
<p>“Spain!” Twain winked at the reporter who asked the question.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Franck!” Heiderscheid’s voice sounded a little flustered and exasperated on the phone. “How can you agree to meet with Twain?”</p>
<p>“Bruno, you’re making this hard for me to do this. He insisted on coming. What can I do?” Ribéry was in a bad mood too. He had been hard pressed recently by the transfer matter. Though he was here on a holiday, he had a frown on every day. He had turned a blind eye to the beautiful scenery and people in front of him. How could he be in the mood? It was actually Bruno’s idea to hide him here from Twain and leave everything to him to handle. All he had do to was wait.</p>
<p>“Simply refuse him!”</p>
<p>“Impossible!” The two men’s voices were raised, “I know the boss’s character well. The more you refuse, the more he wants to come. He will definitely do what he believes.”</p>
<p>“Then just shed all pretense of cordiality…”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you figured the situation out, Bruno? I’m his player, and I’m to go head to head against him? Don’t you know how he treats the people with whom he has fallen out with?”</p>
<p>“Franck, you’re the one who hasn’t figured out the situation. You must be a little tougher. You’re going to wear the white jersey next season, and you still care how he treats the traitors?”</p>
<p>The last remark roused Ribéry, who dazedly held the phone for a moment. “Bruno, I trust you to deal with Real Madrid. But I still think I have to the boss no matter what. I have no reason to turn him down, and I don’t want to fall out with him. After all, who gave me the chance to become the Franck Ribéry that I am now when I was in dire straits?”</p>
<p>Ribéry resolutely finished this sentence and hung up.</p>
<p>Over there, Heiderscheid looked at the phone in his hand and indignantly scolded, Idiot! All my efforts will be in vain when he meets him! Who do you think Tony Twain is, Franck?”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the bright sunshine of the Iberian Peninsula, Ribéry smiled and took the small suitcase from Twain.</p>
<p>“Spain is a really nice place, much better weather than the damn British weather.” Dunn looked up at the clear blue sky. He wore sunglasses and was not afraid of the bright sunshine piercing his eyes. “You’re really know how to pick a place, Franck.”</p>
<p>He made a seemingly innocent remark which sounded intentional to the listener. In fact, the remark was made intentionally, and he wanted the listener to catch his meaning too.</p>
<p>As expected, Ribéry just smiled and did not continue this subject.</p>
<p>Seeing his own trusted player, Twain’s previously agitated heart finally calmed down a little. He knew that if Ribéry was determined not to see him, then this matter would be dangerous. As long as Ribéry was willing to meet him, there was room to turn things around.</p>
<p>In the hired car to the hotel where he was staying, Twain and Ribéry sat side by side in the back. A Spanish pop song was playing on the radio in the car, but neither of them spoke first.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It was Twain who spoke up first. After all, he was here to solve the problem, and not really to roam free with Ribéry in Mallorca.</p>
<p>“Should I console you first, Franck?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“The France team at this UEFA European Championship…” In the final match of the group stage between France and Italy, Twain was the guest pundit. At that time, he berated the French team and only let go of two people. One is Benzema and the other was Ribéry.</p>
<p>Ribéry’s performance spoke for itself. When almost everyone gave up, only he still ran ceaselessly, broke through, passed the balls, and shot… for the chance to breach the goal. In his four years at Nottingham Forest, Twain’s style had long been etched in his bones. He would not give up right till the end of the game. The “Nottingham Forest style” of never conceding in the face of adversity had also become Ribéry style.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however powerful a player was, he was still only one person. Football was played by a team. His efforts appeared to be even more striking and heart-wrenching against the contrast of ten other cowardly and incompetent players. In the end, Ribéry did not bring victory to the national team and the France national team, the highly anticipated favorite to win the title, return home from the group stage.</p>
<p>The game ended and the Italians caroused. They survive by the skin of their teeth and advanced from the group. The French players were dejected. But who had noticed the anger in Ribéry’s eyes?</p>
<p>Hearing Twain mention this incident, Ribéry smiled, “Hey, the game is over. I don’t want to think about it anymore. How can such a good thing happen in the world? I can’t win all the championship titles alone. I’m already very satisfied…. with this season. As a professional footballer, I have won all the club honors I can get.”</p>
<p>Twain glanced at Ribéry ahead.</p>
<p>After that, the two men did not speak again until the car arrived at the destination.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the room, Twain watched the attendant leave and close the door before he was finally able to speak the words bottled in his heart.</p>
<p>“Franck, you don’t really think I’m here for a holiday, do you?”</p>
<p>Ribéry smiled and said, “You’re very much dressed the part.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t want the following conversation to be too serious … I know what you’re doing here, and I also know what your agent is doing.” Twain’s expression still unknowingly became serious. “I’d like to hear your thoughts.”</p>
<p>“My? I…” Silent for a while and as if he had made a big decision, Ribéry continued, “Boss, do you want to hear the truth or the lie?”</p>
<p>“Who wants to hear a lie?” Tell the truth.” Twain waved his hands.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I’ve always the pay package was a little low…”</p>
<p>“If it’s about a pay rise, you can just bring it up. The club is not unreasonable….”</p>
<p>“But, boss… um, let me be honest. I think with the current financial situation of the club; it may not meet my requirements.”</p>
<p>Twain did not speak and Ribéry did not continued at this point. The two men looked at each other in this way.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s put this mess aside and take me out to eat. I’m hungry.” Twain rubbed his stomach and smiled at Ribéry, “It’s your treat.”</p>
<p>Ribéry also smiled, “No problem.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain did not really intend to have a holiday in this picturesque tourist destination. Where was he going to find the luxury of time? He decided to fly back to England the next day. He still had a lot of matters waiting for him.</p>
<p>“It’s really a short vacation.” In the room with his packed bag—there was actually nothing much to pack. There was only a few sets of clothes in a small suitcase and nothing else. Twain did not even buy any travel souvenirs—Ribéry looked at the suitcase on the bed and commented.</p>
<p>Twain stood on the terrace outside the door, looking out over the clear blue sky.</p>
<p>“The sky is really blue here. Spain is really attractive as compared to Britain…”</p>
<p>“Boss, if you like it, you can buy a villa here and come here every summer.” Ribéry pretended not to catch Twain’s meaning in his remarks.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to work if I really live here long term, Franck.” Twain snapped out of his reverie and replied with a smile, “When it’s stormy, the currently calm sea will not be fun. Beautiful things are short-lived. I’m still going to advise you to stay in Nottingham.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say I was going, boss…”</p>
<p>“But in the eyes of the media outside, you’re infinitely close to Real Madrid, aren’t you?” On this day, Twain paid attention to the local Spanish newspapers. Although he could not read Spanish, Ribéry’s picture and name were recognizable. After Cristiano Ronaldo’s transfer rapidly progressed in the direction of a “farce”, Franck Ribéry’s emergence rekindled the Real Madrid fans and Spaniards.</p>
<p>“As long as the club can meet my salary requirements, I will immediately renew my contract with the club.”</p>
<p>Twain smiled. The words sounded more like a blank check. “Can you tell me how much will be appropriate?”</p>
<p>This time, Ribéry hesitated and passed the buck to his agent, “You need to talk to Bruno about this, Boss. He’s fully in charge of this.”</p>
<p>Hearing this remark, Twain nodded hard.</p>
<p>“You should know what your agent had contacted me about, right? Then, you must already know how that went, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Ribéry nodded wordlessly.</p>
<p>“One hundred and fifty thousand.” Twain sighed, “I thought it was just an excuse and a cover created by Heiderscheid for your successful transfer to force us to accept the reality that you have to transfer. But…it seems to be true now.” He shrugged and continued, “You should know the current financial situation of the club. We really can’t offer such a high price to renew the contract. In order to build that… the new stadium, I have to tighten the purse strings to get by, pick up bargains on the transfer market, negotiate with the other parties several times for a euro… I really, really, hope you understand the club’s situation.</p>
<p>He said it very sincerely, and he could not doubt that he had his ulterior motives for saying so. Ribéry continued to remain silent.</p>
<p>“I hate to say this, but I hope you can think about it. A team like Real Madrid is not where you want to be. Only Nottingham Forest is your home. Do you hate your teammates, coaches, and the fans?”</p>
<p>“No, boss. I don’t hate anyone.” Ribéry shook his head and said, “I think my four seasons at Nottingham Forest have been the most enjoyable since I became a professional footballer. Until now, I still can’t believe sometimes that Franck Ribéry, who was on the verge of losing his job in Boulogne, would one day lift up the Champions League trophy. What’s more, twice in a row.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you have to leave?”</p>
<p>“Boss, I didn’t say I had to leave. But I hope to get paid in a way that is proportional to what I give.”</p>
<p>“We offered you a new contract, but your agent threw it in the trash without even looking at it. Then he pointed it back at me and told me: ‘The club is not sincere!’” Twain raised his voice, “I admit that it is simply not possible for the club to renew your contract at a rate of one hundred and fifty thousand a week. But can you consider the difficulties of the club and make a few concessions? Your agent is dead set on one hundred and fifty thousand. There’s no such negotiation in the world, and I even think he’s deliberately threatening me…”</p>
<p>Ribéry hurriedly waved his hands and said, “Boss, please believe me. Between Real Madrid and Nottingham Forest, I definitely choose the latter… Of course, as long as the conditions are right.”</p>
<p>Twain glanced at him and said, “You’re telling the truth. There are some things I’ve always wanted to say to you, but I don’t know if it’s appropriate to say that. The Nottingham Forest fans adore you; your teammates love you and you’re very popular in the team. We have just won the Champions League title for two seasons in a row and the Premier League title last season. In every aspect, the team and you are on the rise. We stay together and can win a lot more championship titles. You can get more out of this in the future by sacrificing a little financial benefit now. I really don’t understand what’s the use of a transfer to Real Madrid, or a weekly salary of one hundred and fifty thousand? There’s only a difference of thirty thousand between one hundred and twenty thousand and one hundred and fifty thousand. You’re not really short of thirty thousand… What’s the point of getting more for your weekly salary? Without honor, you will soon be forgotten. Unless you can keep winning and obtaining victories, it’s no use sitting on the bench for two hundred thousand a week. Do you get what I mean, Franck? Often times, honor is far more important than money.”</p>
<p>Ribéry was quiet.</p>
<p>Twain raised his wrist to look at his watch, “I’ve got to go, there’s still a bunch of things waiting for me in Nottingham. You continue your vacation here…”</p>
<p>“No, boss. In fact, I can actually follow…”</p>
<p>He waved his hands and said, “I said I’d give an extra week off for the players who participated in the UEFA European Championship, so you should take the full week off. If you don’t rest well and your body has any condition, then you’re going to suffer when the season starts. The body is more important than anything else. You have a good time here and relax. The sea and sky in Spain are really blue!” He patted Ribéry on the shoulder and lifted the small suitcase from the bed. Then he put on his straw hat and left the vacation spot, Mallorca, Spain, under the blue sky.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 662 - That’s It</p>
<p>Twain had just stepped foot in Nottingham when Real Madrid’s second offer came.</p>
<p>It was sixty-five million euros!</p>
<p>One must know that Real Madrid was also only willing to offer a maximum of seventy-five million euros for Cristiano Ronaldo. At first, there were media in Nottingham that ridiculed Real Madrid as completely using Ribéry to substitute for Ronaldo. Since they were so disrespectful to the Forest team’s player, Ribéry was not expected to receive good treatment when he went there. Now that Real Madrid had shown with its actions that they were not looking for Cristiano Ronaldo’s replacement, but another star player of the same class as Ronaldo.</p>
<p>If Twain nodded his assent, this would be a transfer with the highest monetary value he had ever made since he took office. But would he agree?</p>
<p>He would not.</p>
<p>Sixty-five million euros was very attractive. But Twain was more obstinate than Real Madrid thought. He thought Real Madrid was showing off its wealth and telling Twain at the same time that there was no one in the world that Real Madrid could not buy!</p>
<p>Consequently, Twain thought he was insulted and threatened, and determined not to yield!</p>
<p>You think there’s no one you can’t buy? Well, well, I’ll show you the first person this time!</p>
<p>Allan flew to China to sign some letters of intent to cooperate with the relevant institutions, so now all matters regarding the club’s transfers of players were all up to Twain. He could rightly reject Real Madrid’s offer.</p>
<p>“I’ll only let Ribéry go when you show me one hundred and fifty million euros. Also, we don’t accept installments and only cash in on the player.”</p>
<p>Twain’s words were resounding and powerful. Accordingly, Ribéry had a new nickname “Mr. 150 million euros.”</p>
<p>Real Madrid certainly would not pay that much unless the intelligence quotient of the top brass had collectively reversed to when they were just born.</p>
<p>However, Real Madrid had their own ways. They have contacted Ribéry’s agent, Heiderscheid, in the hope that he would put pressure on Nottingham Forest internally.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The team had already started to resume training and all the players who did not have any Olympic or UEFA European Championship assignments, had returned. Whether or not they would remain in the team in the coming month or so, they were still Tony Twain’s men for now.</p>
<p>Because not everyone was here yet, the training plan Dunn had arranged for the team was focused on the recovery of stamina, and he did not carry out any tactical training. The club’s focus was still on the transfer market during this time.</p>
<p>Ribéry had become one of Nottingham Forest’s most high-profile transfers in the summer and everyone was watching the latest developments. Some people did not want Ribéry to go, and some people also thought if his departure could bring a large sum of money for the club, then he should be allowed to leave. There were also some people who angrily accused Ribéry of being too greedy—the news of the one hundred and fifty thousand weekly salary had long been exposed by the media. The other people also felt that a traitor like Ribéry should not stay at Nottingham Forest even if he begged to.</p>
<p>The rumors swirled around. At the heart of the vortex of rumors, Ribéry had remained silent and refused interviews this whole time. He did not make any statement and continued his vacation in Mallorca, waiting for his time to return to the team.</p>
<p>After the half-day training had ended, Twain received a phone call from Bruno Heiderscheid in his office. He smiled when he saw the name.</p>
<p>“Hello, Mr. Heiderscheid. To what do I owe this pleasure this time?” He deliberately made his voice sound happy.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tony Twain. I think we should sit down and have a proper discussion…” Heiderscheid’s voice was less relaxed, and even lost the calm at their last meeting.</p>
<p>“What’s there to talk about? A weekly salary of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds? Oh, I’m sorry, we are a small club and really could not offer you satisfactory conditions. However, we may be small, but we are always developing. Let’s do it like this, when Ribéry’s contract expires in six months, we’ll talk again. Maybe the club can meet your one hundred and fifty weekly salary requirements at that time.” Twain’s tone was odd. He deliberately provoked Heiderscheid to pay back double the previous insult suffered.</p>
<p>Twain initially wanted to go home. But now, he sat in the chair, put his feet up on his desk, adopted an amusing stance, and was ready to waste this agent’s precious time here.</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, you do not have the mentality you should have in a negotiation…”</p>
<p>“Ha!” Twain could not help laugh, “These words sound familiar. You plagiarized my lines. Do I have to sue you for infringement?”</p>
<p>Heiderscheid did not know whether to laugh or cry when he heard this. He thoroughly experienced the level of cutting nature this man had. But he came to facilitate Ribéry’s transfer and not to quarrel with Twain, so he suppressed his anger and tried to sound calm.</p>
<p>“Of course, I want Ribéry to stay at the Forest team. But shouldn’t the Forest team show any indication? So far, I haven’t seen any real action from Nottingham Forest to show my player and the outside world that you want to keep Franck Ribéry.”</p>
<p>“How would you know about our business? Rest assured that a new contract will soon be faxed to you and Ribéry… Of course, it’s definitely not a one hundred and fifty thousand weekly salary. We really can’t offer this sum, Mr. Heiderscheid… Nottingham Forest is so poor that I, as a manager, almost buy someone out of my own pocket.” Twain talked as if he was miserable himself but Heiderscheid was unmoved. Only a fool would believe his words.</p>
<p>“But your conditions will not satisfy my player…”</p>
<p>“It’s more like we can’t satisfy you, Mr. Greedy?” Twain smirked, “To be honest, Franck told me he doesn’t want to leave Nottingham Forest, and I think he sincerely thought so. But you tell me you also don’t want Franck to leave Nottingham Forest and that’s a lie. I’m very clear about what an agent does. And I’m even more f**king aware of what you, as his agent, does!”</p>
<p>Next, without waiting for Heiderscheid to refute, Twain had an outburst and vented, “You have to draw ten percent commission from Ribéry’s weekly salary and also draw commission every time he signed those advertising endorsement deals and the signing fee with each renewal of a new contract. If he doesn’t get a high salary at Nottingham Forest, your income will be reduced, and you won’t be able to get the signing fee if there’s no transfer. Only a transfer to a big club like Real Madrid can give Ribéry a higher profile, fame and better commercial contracts. A higher weekly salary means more commission for you. You think of Ribéry as a cash cow, but don’t think about the lifespan of his playing! I’m afraid one day when you realize that Ribéry can’t bring you a higher income, you’ll leave to find the next fool, right? Mr. Bruno Heiderscheid aka Mr. Ten Percent?”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Shut up! I don’t want him to leave, and I can’t meet the higher salary requirements. But I know this better than you fool, what is the most important and fundamental thing for a professional footballer! Without honor, a moron will give you a weekly salary of one hundred and fifty thousand. Once he leaves Nottingham Forest, Ribéry would never receive a higher honor more than here. In this circle, those who quickly become famous and then transfer to the powerhouse teams, quickly lose themselves. Then their prices eventually fall instead of rising. There are plenty of examples whereby the players’ form decline, and no team will ask for a price any longer. If you’re really looking out for Franck as you say, you keep him away from Real Madrid! There’s no paradise for him there at all. It’s just a hotbed of a parasite like you!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, I think…”</p>
<p>“What do you think? I’ll tell you; my stance is that of the Nottingham Forest Football Club. Ribéry is not for sale in the team. Even if Real Madrid offered one hundred and fifty million euros like a fool, I won’t sell! His contract is still three years away. If you want to him to leave, you can directly refuse to negotiate a new contract with us two and a half years later!”</p>
<p>“Then you won’t get a single euro at that time…”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with that!” Twain’s rough tone rendered Heiderscheid speechless.</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, I understand that you are personally biased against me. But business is business and we are now negotiating for Ribéry’s future. Your attitude is not what a businessman should have…”</p>
<p>“I’m the f**king manager of the team. Which idiot told you I was a businessman?” Twain had never seen such a shameless and despicable person like Heiderscheid. Billy Woox was a model citizen as compared to him.</p>
<p>“Besides, I know why you were thick skinned enough to call me. It must be Real Madrid’s idiot president who asked you to put pressure on us, right? I know more about Real Madrid’s moves than you do. Just tell them, I, Tony Twain is not to be trifled with. You want to buy my man? No way! In addition, I will tell you, Ribéry’s contract expires only in three years. There is no more discussion before it expires!”</p>
<p>Twain laughed after he hung up. He had vented the resentment bottled up in his chest at last. He believed that Heiderscheid must be shaking on the other end.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In fact, the crux of Ribéry’s transfer incident was whether Ribéry was willing to come out in person, as a player to put pressure on the club, so that Real Madrid’s next steps could be carried out.</p>
<p>Just as Ronaldo had recently publicly declared that he wanted to go to Real Madrid and said he felt like a slave. Although these words would cause him a lot of trouble, it would also help him with his transfer. After a showdown between the player and the club, it proved that his heart was no longer with the team. Then Real Madrid could aim at this point to begin attack. The opposing club would most likely be under pressure from the many parties and agree to the player’s transfer.</p>
<p>There would always be the exceptions. Real Madrid’s “universal formula” did not mean that it would work with any opponent at any time. This time they hit a wall with the steely Ferguson. The old man was furious after he heard Ronaldo’s remarks. He claimed that he would rather put Ronaldo on the bench first than to sell him to the shameless Real Madrid.</p>
<p>This remark caused Ferguson a lot of trouble, but he sent a very clear message to Real Madrid in this way—my attitude is unyielding, Manchester United’s attitude is tough, and we are determined not to sell Ronaldo to you!</p>
<p>In this way, Real Madrid was out of moves. Unless they accepted Manchester United’s offer and raise their bid to the point where Manchester United is satisfied, only then it would be possible to negotiate a personal contract with Ronaldo. Otherwise, no matter how Ronaldo stirred things up, they must first get past the Manchester United Football Club, which was also Ferguson.</p>
<p>Real Madrid fared even worse with Ribéry’s case. They did not even manage to get Ribéry to come forward and make a stance.</p>
<p>Real Madrid wanted Heiderscheid to put pressure on Ribéry and then for Ribéry to put pressure on Twain. For example, he should have a direct showdown—“I want to go to Real Madrid, and I don’t want to stay with Nottingham Forest.”</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Franck!” Heiderscheid’s voice sounded a little pathetic on the phone. It was not accurate to say he was flustered and exasperated. “I need you to come out and make a stance.”</p>
<p>“What stance?” Ribéry sat on a white beach chair and wore his sunglasses while he sunbathed. The picturesque seaside did really relax him, and sometimes he did forget the swirling rumors of a tumultuous transfer outside and enjoy his time with ease.</p>
<p>His wife, Wahiba Belhami took his children back to her hometown in Algeria. The reason he did not take his whole family on vacation was because Ribéry thought it was not a real vacation at all, but to avoid the limelight. He did not want to involve his beautiful wife and lovely children. But this rare opportunity had allowed him to openly admire the sexy and open Spanish beauties.</p>
<p>“What do you think? The whole world is now waiting for you to come forward and make a statement so that all the noise will be gone. Then you and I can have a nice summer!”</p>
<p>“I saw the new contract that boss had faxed, Bruno.” Ribéry changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think a one hundred and twenty thousand weekly salary is too low.” Ribéry continued to admire the naked bodies wandering back and forth before his eyes.</p>
<p>“Hey…”</p>
<p>“Bruno, I don’t think it’s a good time to transfer to Real Madrid…”</p>
<p>“Franck, when do you think it’s a good time? After three seasons? I don’t know if Real Madrid wants you or not at that time! You’ve got enough honors now, so the current transfer is when you’re at your highest value, and I can get the best of anything for you. I know what that guy, Twain, said to you, but he’s lying to you! You can’t be a professional player your entire life, Franck. Can honors not let you worry about your living for a lifetime and give your children the best life possible? Those are just the false words that the managers use to stir up your sentiments and excuses to make you sacrifice for them! Only money is real. But there aren’t many clubs in the world willing to recompense the players commensurate with their contributions. Instead they’re always making excuses to squeeze your income. Businessmen are all the same in the pursuit of interests. Even if he’s your chief, he’s still a manager. Don’t forget which side he’s on. He represents the club! He talks of loyalty, honor and so on. Those are all lies for you to listen to! When he says that to you, you just ask him this, ‘Can honor make you live a good life?’ I’d bet you he will be speechless!” Sensing that Ribéry was wavering, Heiderscheid became anxious. The plan he had made all summer would not absolutely fail at this time… “Franck, you should know more about this than I do. You had experienced poverty. You know how important money is, right?”</p>
<p>“I… Bruno, I think you have a good point. Honor and loyalty really can’t make me any more money, and it doesn’t let me live a better life. A professional player has to go after the money… But.”</p>
<p>Bruno’s chest tightened.</p>
<p>“But now I’m pretty happy with the level of one hundred and twenty thousand weekly salary.”</p>
<p>“Only a fool would be unhappy with more money!”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’m not a fool, but I know my team’s current situation. If the price is too high, the boss really can’t get the money…”</p>
<p>“Then transfer.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to be a traitor, Bruno?” Ribéry gave a laugh, “But I’m not ready for betrayal yet. That’s it, I’m going to sign that contract. Tomorrow I’ll end this… hiding on vacation and fly back to Nottingham.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Franck!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“As for Real Madrid…”</p>
<p>“Nottingham Forest’s attitude is so tough and they’re still fantasizing about me going to Bernabéu with a transfer deal? So, what if I make a public statement? I’m telling you, Bruno, I understand my boss. I know what it would be like if I really did this. You think the boss will let me go because I want to go? Don’t be naive, Bruno! Real Madrid’s approach is to put themselves out of the way and use the players as guns. For me to step out as a target while they trade behind the scenes. What if the deal doesn’t go through? How am I going to stay at Nottingham Forest after falling out with my boss? Remember Anelka? Do you want me to sit on the bench for a season and then my value slowly slips? You can tell Real Madrid clearly that I don’t want to gamble with myself. Either they make an offer until the Nottingham Forest Football Club is satisfied, or I will renew my contract with the Forest team and stay in Nottingham. The move that they are used to do, it won’t work in my case!”</p>
<p>Hanging up the phone, Ribéry stared at the distant horizon in the sea and was lost in contemplation. He completely lost the mood to continue to his appreciation of the beautiful women.</p>
<p>To be able to play for a world-famous powerhouse club like Real Madrid was exactly what he wanted. Spain had beautiful sunshine and a variety of delicious cuisines, thousand times better than the United Kingdom. There would also be more attention at the Bernabéu, and the salary would certainly be more than Nottingham Forest’s. The star-studded teammates, weekly events, glitzy lifestyle…</p>
<p>However, he also knew from his heart that it was almost impossible for Real Madrid to buy him with the boss around. To let him come forward for himself? That would be disastrous. He did not want to be the gun in someone else’s hand. Cristiano Ronaldo was so stupid. What if Real Madrid failed to deliver on their promise to bring him to Bernabéu, then who would the real victim? The players themselves!</p>
<p>I can’t do such a risky thing. As long as I don’t leave Nottingham Forest, the boss is our king.</p>
<p>Those who contradict the king all end up with terrible deaths…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 663 - Twain’s Many Troubles</p>
<p>Real Madrid’s finance director, Sanchez, was still waiting for Ribéry to come forward and switch sides to give his battle for him a crucial turning point. However, the result he had gotten instead was for Heiderscheid’s request for them to continue to raise their bid until they satisfied Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>This news shocked him and made him a little angry.</p>
<p>“Sixty-five million is still not enough? Does Nottingham Forest really want us to make an offer of one hundred and fifty million euros?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid so, Mr. Sanchez…” said Mr. Heiderscheid weakly.</p>
<p>“That’s not possible!” Sanchez raised his voice and almost slammed the table. He had never met such a shameless, despicable, avaricious and insatiable team. “Ribéry is not worth one hundred and fifty million euros at all. We won’t even offer seventy million, not to mention one hundred and fifty million. Sixty-five million is our final offer!”</p>
<p>Tony Twain’s shamelessness angered Sanchez. He was the finance director of the world’s best club of the twentieth century. In terms of status, Tony Twain would not be catch up even if he tried. How could he act so arrogant in front of him?</p>
<p>“Mr. Sanchez, Nottingham Forest had already offered Frank a new contract. If Real Madrid does not give any indication, he will have to accept this offer to renew the contract.”</p>
<p>“We don’t plan to buy Ribéry with our entire transfer fund. The board won’t agree with me to do so. If he really wants to renew his contract with Nottingham Forest, I can only express my regrets.”</p>
<p>Sanchez’s words were cold, which sank Heiderscheid’s heart to the bottom of the ocean. He worked hard on this plan for half a year, and now it was wasted efforts…</p>
<p>“Wait, Mr. Sanchez. Maybe there’s still a way to turn things around…”</p>
<p>“Turn things around? If you have a way to convince Tony Twain, then this matter can be redeemed. But Mr. Heiderscheid, do you have a way to convince him?”</p>
<p>This was in fact a denial of Heiderscheid’s ability. Heiderscheid wanted to retort, but he immediately realized sadly that he really had no retort…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Ribéry flew back to England and then signed a new contract with the Nottingham Forest Football Club. This contract is for 2008 to 2013, with a weekly salary of up to one hundred and twenty thousand pounds. This contract made Ribéry the player with the highest-paid weekly salary.</p>
<p>This news was immediately posted on Nottingham Forest’s official website that day. Real Madrid knew their plans for Ribéry had completely failed… Sanchez lost to Mijatović, who could now have enough energy to pursue the indecisive Cristiano Ronaldo. To that end, Real Madrid even offered to use Robinho to make good as part of the signing fee for the transfer, which provoked strong opposition and resistance from Robinho. It led to the breakdown of his relationship with Real Madrid and he claimed that he wanted to transfer to Chelsea. But these were Real Madrid’s team matters, which Twain did not care. He had no interest in Robinho and did not want to profit from another team’s misfortune.</p>
<p>“I know there’s been a lot of talk about me this summer, but I’d say they were all rumors. I’ve never admitted to any of them. I became famous at Nottingham Forest and my heart belongs to Nottingham Forest. I love the fans here and I want to continue to win honors for you.” He told local media with a smile on his face at the press conference.</p>
<p>Twain also smiled and said, “I’m delighted that Ribéry has renewed his contract with us. Nottingham Forest’s brilliance is definitely more than just these two seasons.”</p>
<p>Ribéry’s agent did not attend the press conference for the signing of the contract. At this time, he cursed Tony Twain, berated Ribéry for failing to live up to expectations…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Having solved the matter with Ribéry, the biggest worry in Twain’s mind finally landed. The good news this busy summer was being able to hold on to the team’s main frame. Many Nottingham Forest fans were happy about it too. They believed that loyalty had made Ribéry overcome the lure of money. But was it true?</p>
<p>The average fan would never know the story behind every transfer deal. How many secrets were unknown to people behind those confusing transfers? Who was really right and who was really wrong among those who left or stayed?</p>
<p>Dunn and Kerslake were in charge of the team’s training. Twain’s current main focus was still on the transfer market.</p>
<p>Several clubs, such as Tottenham Hotspur and Keane’s Sunderland, had expressed interest in Chimbonda. However, they were both mid-to-lower level teams. Twain did not mind selling to sell Chimbonda there, but none of these clubs’ offers would satisfy his demands.</p>
<p>He put Chimbonda’s price tag at a minimum of eight million pounds, while Tottenham Hotspur only offered six million dollars, and not a penny more. Sunderland could only make a bid of up to five million.</p>
<p>Moreover, Chimbonda himself did not want to leave Nottingham Forest, where he still had a year left on his contract. He wanted to stay with the team and leave after completing the year’s contract. Twain certainly did not want to do so. If he waited a year before Chimbonda could leave on a free transfer, Nottingham Forest would not get a dime.</p>
<p>After much contemplation, Twain decided to renege on his words and accept Tottenham Hotspur’s six million-pound offer.</p>
<p>Chimbonda simply turned down Tottenham Hotspur’s contract. With a lower weekly salary than at the Forest team, this team had no ability to compete for the championship titles. He would not achieve anything there. He still wanted to win a few more championship trophies for himself— he believed it was possible to do so if he followed Tony Twain—and then leave.</p>
<p>The negotiations were at an impasse.</p>
<p>Twain did not have time to watch Chimbonda. There were the other players whom he needed to worry about.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Sidwell’s situation was quite the opposite of Chimbonda’s. There were a number of teams who wanted to bring him in, and he insisted that he must leave the Forest team. But Twain did not want him to go. Twain did not strong-armed Sidwell this time.</p>
<p>On the face of it, it sounded nice to say “I will never forget my year at Nottingham Forest” —of course it was unforgettable. As the midfield core of the Reading team and England’s star of hope, he ended up sitting on the bench for a year at Nottingham Forest till his buttocks were almost covered with sores. He could not forget even if he wanted to. “I’m grateful for my time at Nottingham Forest, where I’ve learned a lot of things” —He learnt how cruel professional football was. He learnt how to be patient and that being the core of a small team counted for nothing in a big team. “I have no complaints against Nottingham Forest” —This was for certain. Who would dare to go against Tony Twain?</p>
<p>In short, Sidwell was determined to leave no matter what and no one could pull him back.</p>
<p>In the end, Twain sold his substitute for the defensive midfielder position whom he brought in on a free transfer year ago to Aston Villa for a price of five million pound. Both Tony Twain and the Aston Villa manager, Martin O’Neill admitted they were optimistic about his ability. But the biggest obstacle to his rise to become a good midfielder at Nottingham Forest was not his ability, but George Wood, this steady monster.</p>
<p>After he sent off Sidwell, the task of finding a replacement for Wood was imminent. But Twain did not fully put his hopes in the transfer market. Kompany was a good candidate. He could play both as the center back and as the defensive midfielder on occasion. Twain intended to focus on his development in both positions.</p>
<p>After all, for the current rear defensive line, Kompany must be able to play multiple positions if he wanted more opportunities to play.</p>
<p>He had no problems in terms of his physical quality. He just needed to re-distinguish the difference between the defensive midfielder and the center back.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain did not stop when it came to the pursuit of players. Bosingwa was his biggest target this season. However, he encountered Chelsea and Manchester United. He could still manage Manchester United, but Chelsea was almost a rival that Tony Twain could not defeat.</p>
<p>It had a wealthy owner, a growing number of Portuguese players in the atmosphere, as well as one of the most important factors—Scolari had officially become the Chelsea manager after The UEFA European Football Championship.</p>
<p>Bosingwa was the Portugal national team’s main right back and Scolari was very familiar with him. He was also very familiar with this manager. It was obviously better to join Chelsea than to go to Nottingham Forest. Because of going to Nottingham Forest, Bosingwa did not know the team’s tactical style and if the manager’s personal style was suitable for him. But there was no such trouble if he joined Chelsea.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest could still afford to offer the transfer fee of twenty million pounds. But the player’s personal will played an important role at this time. He wanted to join a team where he knew the manager well. Chelsea eventually took Bosingwa for just sixteen and a half million pounds, causing Twain to do a month of useless work.</p>
<p>Twain did not even dare to consider a right back like Dani Alves who was too expensive…</p>
<p>The failure in Bosingwa’s transfer was certainly bad news to Twain, but perhaps it was good news for the other guy.</p>
<p>Twain had to suspend talks with Tottenham Hotspur about Chimbonda’s transfer due to the difficulty in the current transfer market to find a right back candidate that would meet his requirements. He must now consider the possibility that he might not have a way to bring in a high-level right back this summer. If he let go of Chimbonda at that time, then the right-hand side would be empty at the start of the league tournament.</p>
<p>For Chimbonda, this change was a good thing. As long as Twain had no intention of selling him this summer, he would certainly be getting a new contract. Because Twain definitely would not allow his players to be sent away for free after a year, even if he did not like the player himself anymore…</p>
<p>Sure enough, two days later, his agent received a call from the Forest Club inviting him to discuss a new contract for Chimbonda.</p>
<p>The new contract was signed for a three-year period and the weekly pay was the same as it was now.</p>
<p>Breaking his original plan to renew the contract with Chimbonda did not mean that Twain had changed his mind about Chimbonda. He planned to use this cushion of time to continue to look for a trusted right back. Once he found the right person, Chimbonda still could not escape the fate of being sold.</p>
<p>Did Chimbonda know this? He must be aware, but he hoped to regain the boss’s trust and acknowledgement during this period.</p>
<p>In fact, he had no other way. He liked his life in Nottingham and was completely used everything here. He really did not want to leave Nottingham. He bought a house here and his family lived in Nottingham. His children also went to school here. Being selected for the France national team was not something he could consider anymore. He wanted to play in a stable environment till he retired and earned enough money to support his family.</p>
<p>In the end, Chimbonda stayed at Nottingham Forest as he wished. While Twain felt very unhappy for having wasted a month, only to come back around in the end without achieving anything.</p>
<p>However, there was a news which was of comfort to him.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Grosso’s transfer talks had a breakthrough development.</p>
<p>Before this, the France Ligue 1 champion, Lyon and the Serie A team, ACF Fiorentina both hope to bring in Grosso. Grosso himself wanted to return to Italy because he realized that he was not suited to play abroad. But the prices offered by Fiorentina and Lyon had a big difference.</p>
<p>Lyon offered Grosso nine million euros, while Fiorentina only offered seven million. When Nottingham Forest brought Grosso to England, it cost seven million euros. After the UEFA European Championship where Grosso’s outstanding performance spoke for itself, there was no reason to sell at the same price.</p>
<p>As a result, Twain did not have to think about it. He agreed to Lyon’s offer and turned down Fiorentina.</p>
<p>But Grosso himself wanted to return to Italy, so the negotiations stalled.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lyon’s sincerity impressed Grosso. Another important reason was that Grosso realized that he was absolutely unable to defy Tony Twain’s will at Nottingham Forest. If Fiorentina did not raise prices, Twain would not agree to his return to Italy. Then he only had one option—to negotiate a contract with Lyon.</p>
<p>In the end, Lyon signed Grosso for nine million euros. It was two million euros more than the price that they wanted to bring in the left back from Inter Milan a year ago. But they felt it was worth it because Lyon was already in a tight spot with the left back position. Abidal went to Barcelona last season and Jérémy Berthod was also on his way to Monaco, so it was imperative to bring in a high-quality left back.</p>
<p>Grosso could not adapt to the English Premier League, but it did not imply that he could not adapt to the France Ligue 1. Lyon was still confident of this player for a world champion.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The renewal of Ribéry’s contract was good news while Sidwell’s departure was considered tolerable news. The failure to bring in Bosingwa was bad news, and Grosso’s transfer success had brought good news to Twain at this time. The recurring theme of Tony Twain’s summer was the constant stream of alternating good and bad news in front of him, tormenting him from side to side till he felt overwrought.</p>
<p>Now Arshavin had brought a swarm of flies to Nottingham Forest thanks to his stunning performance at the UEFA European Championship. In addition, Barcelona’s newly appointed manager, Guardiola had also made the announcement that the team was going to focus on defense, causing the Catalan media to make eyes at Piqué which troubled Twain.</p>
<p>There was also the constant bad news with regards to replenishing the midfield. Javi García and Rubén de la Red, whom Twain was keen on before the UEFA European Championship, were already taken by Real Madrid which used the buyback clause to recall Javi García and Rubén de la Red. Now they appeared at the Austrian training camp, dressed in Real Madrid’s white jerseys.</p>
<p>Twain had no choice but to turn his attention to the Spain national team’s other outstanding defensive midfielder at the European Championship— Marcos Senna.</p>
<p>In the European Championship, it was Senna’s tireless running and shoveling defense in the midfield that led Spain all the way to the final and eventually picked up the Henri Delaunay Trophy. In the quarter-final against Italy, it was due to his presence that Italy was almost out of play. He threatened Buffon’s goal with a long shot again and again—in this respect, his attack was better than Wood’s, so much so that Spain’s manager, Aragonés thought about whether it was better to place Fàbregas or Xavi next to Senna. Whereas Xabi Alonso, who had excelled in the English Premier League, was glued to the bench because of Senna’s presence.</p>
<p>This was a guy who was good enough to replace Wood on most games. But… the problem was still very big.</p>
<p>In terms of the player’s personal will, Senna was rather vague and did not say he wanted to leave or mention his loyalty. But it was his ambiguous attitude that made it difficult for Nottingham Forest—because they did not know how much effort should be put into this player and whether it would be worth it after putting in the effort. If he continued to stay in Villarreal, he had little hope of winning any honor and it was believed that Senna was well aware of this point. But Villarreal had given him everything he had now. It was not something that he could quickly make up his mind to throw everything away and transfer.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle came from the Villarreal club. The Yellow Submarine made it clear that Senna was not for sale when Twain first asked for the price, asking Nottingham Forest not to get any ideas on this captain.</p>
<p>This tough attitude was exactly the same as Twain’s rejection of Real Madrid’s pursuit of Ribéry. After he had the same pleasure of doing this to the others, Twain now experienced the taste of being rejected by the others… It was really the reversal of fortunes.</p>
<p>In short, as long as the transfer window did not end, Twain would still have all sorts of troubles like these. And now he had to pack up these troubles and take them with him.</p>
<p>It was already time to go to China and Asia to make money.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 664 - The China Trip</p>
<p>Twain was not from Ningbo or Zhejiang. Before his transmigration, he had only been to three places in a big country like China—his hometown in a small town in the south of Sichuan; the capital of China, Beijing where he went to university; and Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, where he worked after he graduated from college.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou belonged to China, it was like another world for him, where he completely could not understand the spoken language there and the cuisine was not to his taste. The social customs and culture were a world of difference. Nor did he think that he would one day work up to the idea of traveling there.</p>
<p>But now, thanks to his soul attaching to this body, he got the opportunity to use “public money for the tour” and came to the place which was previously only a name symbol for him—the city of Ningbo in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>He certainly did not come here on vacation. In fact, during this trip to China, the quirky and charming Shania was not here to accompany him. Instead, he was accompanied by a large group of men.</p>
<p>Indeed, they were all the members of the Nottingham Forest Football Club.</p>
<p>A year ago, the Nottingham Forest Football Club secured a large piece of land in Clifton, south-west of Nottingham, to build a new stadium. The city government strongly supported it and allowed them to buy the land at a lower price. Needless to say, there was no such thing as a free lunch. In return, they had to do something for the city of Nottingham.</p>
<p>Now was the time to give back to the government.</p>
<p>Essentially, Nottingham Forest’s trip was purely a gold rush, the actions of businessmen seeking profit. But the publicity aspect of it was loftier.</p>
<p>In fact, this was the first cultural exchange between England’s city of Nottingham and China’s city of Ningbo. With full fanfare, the Nottingham Cultural Promotion Week would be held here in full swing along with the visit of the UEFA Champions League winner, Nottingham Forest. The Chinese people in Ningbo did not have to travel to the other side of the mainland to England and they could enjoy the most authentic English culture and atmosphere.</p>
<p>The relationship between Nottingham and Ningbo dated back to 2005, when the two cities signed a contract to formally cement as friendly sister cities. As a gift, the prestigious University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom collaborated with the Ningbo Municipal Government to replicate the university in its entirety and brought it to Ningbo. A completely independent University of Nottingham was established in Ningbo and used the University of Nottingham configuration from the qualified teachers to the teaching materials. The students who successfully graduated could receive the University of Nottingham diploma issued by the University of Nottingham.</p>
<p>With these relationships, it was not surprising that Nottingham Forest’s visit to China was set in Ningbo.</p>
<p>This was the result of the partnership between the club and the city government. Without this relationship, Allan Adams would not care about any relationship of the sister cities. He would prefer to visit and set the competition venue at Beijing or Shanghai in China. But since they bought the land cheaply, they naturally would have to pay the price. The good news was the loss here could be made up elsewhere—the Japanese’s feverish enthusiasm for Beckham was enough to make Allan dream and wake up laughing while Southeast Asia and Hong Kong had long been the English Premier League’s biggest audience in Asia. The Premier League’s status was simply unmatched by any other leagues.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s opponent had already been announced before coming to Ningbo. On the day of the announcement, the name of the opponent surprised Twain. It was China Olympic team.</p>
<p>This was also Allan’s stroke of genius.</p>
<p>Considering that the impact of this game held in Ningbo was too small, he decided to find a sufficiently influential opponent for Nottingham Forest. Now that the whole of China was crazy about the Beijing Olympic Games to be held in August, what was more convenient than to use the currently trending Olympic Games to promote themselves?</p>
<p>Accordingly, he got in touch with China’s Aide Group and the Chinese Football Association, hoping to arrange a friendly match—to the industry insiders, this was called a “friendly.” To the average fans, this was a “commercial game.” The opponent was the China Olympic football team.</p>
<p>Since the national Olympic team was intensely preparing for the Olympics, they needed a high-level opponent to do their warm-up. What team could be more suitable other than the Champions League champion?</p>
<p>This was an attractive plan for the Chinese Football Association. Firstly, they did not have to pay for the high-level teams from abroad to come play the friendlies; secondly, Nottingham Forest’s was indeed high and the whole world knew of this team now. It was beneficial for the China Olympic team to play against them; thirdly, it was also helpful for the UEFA Champions League winner, Nottingham Forest and the Olympic host’s Olympic team to have a friendly to promote the Olympic Games around the world. Since the torch relay, the opposition of some western countries to the Olympic Games had not stopped and was increasingly critical. This friendly should be able to convey another completely opposite voice, as long as it was in the premise of the Olympic Games, everything could be done.</p>
<p>The Chinese Football Association agreed in principle to the proposal, but they also had their own requirements…</p>
<p>The Chinese Football Association wanted to partake in the sharing of the revenue from the competition.</p>
<p>Allan and the head of Aide Group looked at each other when they heard this proposal. Allan did not quite understand this approach, but Adidas was a professional company that often operated foreign teams to play commercial games in China. They told Allan that if they wanted to deal with the Chinese Football Association, they would often come across this kind of incidents which would make the foreigners feel outrageous. And to be honest, this request was not really too demanding…</p>
<p>It was only then that Allan recalled what Twain said about “China’s national conditions.” He had been traveling back and forth from England to China for half a year and thought he should have similar understanding of China as Twain. He realized now that he was still far behind that guy Tony Twain….</p>
<p>Allan Adams agreed to the Chinese Football Association’s proposal. After agreeing on the specific splits, the Chinese Football Association, Aide Group and Nottingham Forest jointly announced that Nottingham Forest’s opponent in the friendly match in China was the China Olympic team.</p>
<p>As soon as the news came out, it immediately garnered the attention of the Chinese media and fans. The press covered the upcoming game extensively. They introduced, promoted and covered Nottingham Forest. The fans also showed a lot of interest in this game. There were also Chinese state-level television stations that had bought the rights to broadcast the game live.</p>
<p>These were what Allan wanted to see most. The China Olympic team’s competition plan had been very successful.</p>
<p>Twain had no objection to this opponent. Not only that, he felt that playing against China Olympic team might be the best choice. If they played against a local team in Zhejiang, Twain would find it boring. Playing those temporarily cobbled together league team would not be able to train the team. Whereas there was some competitive value to compete against a national Olympic team which had trained together for a long time.</p>
<p>Yes, Allan only thought about the economic effects, while Twain cared about the competitive value. These two words were spelled the same in Chinese Pinyin, but they were completely unrelated. In professional football clubs, it was almost the opposite.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The Nottingham Forest star players received a very warm welcome when they disembarked. The drizzle also did not prevent the fans from coming to the airport. The beautiful young ladies lined up below the airport escalators to offer flowers. The warm and bright Ningbo girls delighted the Nottingham Forest players. Other than a few big star players who were a little reserved and had to maintain their personal images, the younger players were stopped short of hugging the girls for a group photo.</p>
<p>Twain did not mind them as it showed that his team was in good shape in his view.</p>
<p>Picking up the floral wreaths from the young ladies, the team walked to the airport bus parked outside the terminal. There was no shortage of warm welcome along the way from the fans who had hurried here after they saw the news., it could be directly observed from the posters which the fans had held up and see who the most popular player on the team was.</p>
<p>Before coming to China, the Nottingham Forest players were bored and decided to make a bet—who was the most popular player in China? Of course, this bet excluded Beckham from the start…</p>
<p>Now the answer was revealed. Besides Beckham, the most popular person was George Wood. Van der Vaart was the runner-up by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>“Wood! Wood!” The enthusiastic Chinese fans held up George Wood’s posters and caricature , shouting his Chinese nickname.</p>
<p>In front of a crowd that welcomed him so warmly, George Wood remained calm and barely smiled. But what he did only prompted a higher decibel of cries and more people’s pursuit.</p>
<p>“Look! That’s a star player! So suave!”</p>
<p>“Wood is so cool!”</p>
<p>“I think he’s cute – ah, Wood! I love you!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Incredible, the zombie face can be so popular…” Ribéry said with gritted teeth as he took in the scene.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some people soon comforted by his “injured heart.””Ribéry! Ribéry! Look this way, look this way!” Someone shouted in English.</p>
<p>He happily turned his head in a hurry and only to see an awkward scene:</p>
<p>A Chinese fan held up a sign and next to him, two fans pointed their fingers at the sign, which read in French: “How much money for you to stay in Nottingham?!”</p>
<p>It was clearly meant to mock the news that he had delayed signing the renewal contract with the club for a reported price of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds and wanted go to Real Madrid.</p>
<p>He could only pretend that he had not seen and gazed at the grey sky.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“This is China!” On the way from the airport to CITIC Ningbo International Hotel where they were staying, the Nottingham Forest teammates looked out of the bus window with great wonder.</p>
<p>“Sun! Sun!” The teammates warmly beckoned Sun Jihai and wanted him to be their tour guide, introducing the scenery along the way which full of China’s Jiangnan flair. “What’s that? And that… Ah, this is beautiful!”</p>
<p>This put Sun Jihai in a very difficult spot. Because although he was Chinese, he was not from Ningbo and not even Jiangnan. He knew nothing about Ningbo and Jiangnan.</p>
<p>If he really wanted to explain to his teammates, he would have to start with China was a very big country. It was so big that it was beyond the imagination of these foreign teammates. In this way, the topic would expand and could not be clarified with two or three sentences.</p>
<p>“Ha… In fact, I do not know anything about Ningbo, I rarely come here…” He could only smile and state his predicament.</p>
<p>His teammates were very disappointed. Since they had a Chinese teammate, they thought they could pull him along to go out and have fun after they reached the hotel. A free local guide would be great!</p>
<p>Dunn looked at Twain, who hurriedly widened his eyes and said, “Don’t look at me. Although I am … I don’t know anything about Ningbo.” He almost let slipped, but luckily Kerslake, sitting in front, was busy taking the digital video to film the scenery along the way.</p>
<p>No one was quiet in the bus compartment. Everyone was holding digital cameras or digital video camera and facing the window. Twain did not do so. He was not interested in what was going on outside, and he was not here for a holiday anyway.</p>
<p>However, he turned his head and a tall billboard erected on the side along the airport road. The background was red and the dark words were Nottingham Forest and the national Olympic team players. The languages on the advertisement were a bit interesting, written in both English and Chinese—A warm welcome to the UEFA Champions League and the English Premier League champions, Nottingham Forest Football Club visiting our city!</p>
<p>He smiled. There was really some “Chinese characteristics” which gave off a cordial feeling to people when they saw this…</p>
<p>There were several billboards on the side of the road. In addition to those which directly promoted the Forest team, there was the Nottingham Forest-related brand sponsors, as well as Aide Group’s advertising. It looked like Allan did a lot of work. Although the game had not yet started to play, the publicity campaign was executed beautifully. Seeing such billboards, he also felt a sense of accomplishment as the Forest team’s manager. He was very proud of his achievements.</p>
<p>It was drizzling in the world outside the window, but this did not affect Ningbo’s image in the hearts of these foreign guests. Because this dynamic Jiangnan-style painting in the hazy rain appeared to be more poetic, adding to the foreigner’s impression of a mysterious country like China. It was surreal like a dream.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After they arrived at the CITIC Ningbo International Hotel, a press conference was held in the hotel, where all the members of the team changed their clothes in the room and attended. This was considered a formal introduction of the team to the Chinese community.</p>
<p>Tony Twain became the main character at the press conference because his love of the Chinese culture was not new, even the football fans in China knew.</p>
<p>Throughout the press conference, he communicated with the media and fan representatives in fluent Mandarin, earning the applause of everyone present each time. Everyone applauded his fluency in Mandarin and his familiarity with China.</p>
<p>Twain was a little sorry about this. If he had gone to Chengdu, Sichuan, he could also use fluent Sichuanese to say hello to everyone…</p>
<p>“… I love China. I love its culture and the friendly people here. I am honored and proud to bring the team to Ningbo. I also hope to show the best of China to my players. I believe this trip to Ningbo must be a wonderful experience for my players!”</p>
<p>His last remarks won him a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Sitting behind, Evan Doughty smiled and clapped while he turned to Allan Adams sitting next to him and said, “And you were worried that he could get you in trouble. Look at his performance. He acted perfectly!”</p>
<p>Allan nodded too, “Yes, I must admit that he did better than I thought. He’s a natural public speaker…”</p>
<p>After the press conference ended, the players returned to their rooms for a rest, and then would gather as a group to ride to the banquet—the Ningbo municipal government held a welcoming dinner for them.</p>
<p>While some reporters and hardcore fans were still staying outside of the hotel lobby and not wanting to leave, Allan had found Twain, “Tony, are you free now?”</p>
<p>Twain knew that Allan had something to discuss with him. But he did not know what it was about. Could it be the matter about Ribéry that happened a while ago?</p>
<p>He nodded and said, “I have some time. What’s the matter, Allan?”</p>
<p>“Come to my room. I have something I want to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>Twain looked at Evan Doughty standing behind Allan and nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 665 - So Tired</p>
<p>In the room on the twentieth floor of the hotel, Twain and Allan were looking at each other. There was no one else in the standard room except them. They could talk in private. Indeed, Allan Adams did not look for Tony Twain to talk about old times, but to discuss business—there was almost no possibility of them discussing any private matters.</p>
<p>“Are you telling the truth?” Twain’s voice was full of doubts.</p>
<p>“You know I never kid, Tony.” Allan shook his head and looked serious. He did not look like he was joking.</p>
<p>Hearing him say so, Twain raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>He had never heard of such a thing, but the truth was really in front of him.</p>
<p>Allan told Twain that the Chinese Football Association wanted to re-establish its image with this game due to the recent football environment in China. When Twain heard this point just now, he almost blurted out, “They have an image?!” Hence, he did not take Allan’s words seriously. As a matter of fact, everything about the Chinese Football Association was basically a joke. There was slapstick style, black humor, and of course, corny jokes as well.</p>
<p>However, what Allan said next stopped Twain from laughing, “… They hope we can tie with the national team in this game.”</p>
<p>This remark immediately caused Twain to knit his brows.</p>
<p>To pre-determine the outcome of the match?</p>
<p>But it was not difficult technically. “A large-scale rotation will do. I can deploy every player on the reserve team. Surely the China Olympic team can manage to tie, right? I can also train the team as well…”</p>
<p>“No, Tony. If you deploy the reserve team our plan for the commercial games will be met with heavy losses. Aide Group hoped that we can deploy the main force as much as possible.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Twain stood up from the couch and said, “Deploy the entire main force to draw with the China Olympic team? Are you insulting our team’s ability?”</p>
<p>Allan waved for him to sit down and said, “That’s why I wanted to talk to you. I know your character, but I hope you can cooperate this once. This is very important for us to open up the Chinese market. You know, in China, no matter who you work with, you always can’t bypass the government…”</p>
<p>Twain sat down again and looked at The Ellen opposite. Adams: “You know China a lot better than before. . . I understand you. “I’s going</p>
<p>Seeing that Twain was not angry, Allan continued, “You can do this with a little flair and make the game thrilling with a lot of goals. And then… in the second half, you can start to change players, replace the main players, try a new lineup and observe the new players. Didn’t you bring in a few players from the youth team? You can take this opportunity to observe their abilities… With regards to these matters, you’re more of an expert than I am as the manager. You should know what to do. In other words, … there was actually no adverse impact on our image. After all, it is the reserve team which was forced to a draw …”</p>
<p>Twain interrupted his words, “Does the China Olympic team know this?”</p>
<p>Allan shook his head in reply, “They won’t know. The Chinese Football Association’s request to them is to strive hard and play to the best…”</p>
<p>“Play to the best of their abilities, fully display their style, study hard, accumulate experience…” Twain helped him finish. He could recite these entreaties.</p>
<p>At this point, he suddenly recalled a long-forgotten memory that had been from at least a decade ago.</p>
<p>In the early days of the professionalization of Chinese football, in addition to the emerging professional leagues which awakened the enthusiasm of Chinese fans for football, there was one thing that was an important evidence to that era… It could even be said to be a sign of the times.</p>
<p>That was the commercialization of the football games all over China.</p>
<p>From Sampdoria’s visit to China in 1994 until 1997, when Maradona led Boca Juniors to China on a “Heroes’ Tour of the Great Wall.” The Chinese football had experienced a dream-like era. “The Undefeated Workers’ Stadium” was the famous catchphrase of that era. Sampdoria, AC Milan, Arsenal, Club Atlético Peñarol and Grêmio all lost to the Chinese team at the Workers’ Stadium. The success against the foreign teams greatly boosted the confidence and enthusiasm of the Chinese fans, thus directly triggering the 1994 and 1995 red-hot Chinese Jia-A League.</p>
<p>Many people were immersed in the joy of beating the world-class strong teams, and even believed that the level of Chinese football had reached such a high level. But when Grêmio lost to China’s Guoan in 1996, the competitive Scolari made an angry attack at a press conference due to the many controversial penalties which were favorable to Guoan during the game and shattered the Chinese fans’ beautiful vision of the commercial games. He said, “I finally understand why so many strong teams lost here. If you only rely on the referee to win, then I believe you will never have a chance to reach the World Cup finals, never!”</p>
<p>Immediately following which, in order to prove that Scolari was definitely not recklessly venting due to the loss, the England national team came to China with its entire main lineup and defeated the Chinese national team with a three-goal victory in the Workers’ Stadium. It thoroughly informed the Chinese fans to take a look at the nature of the commercial game.</p>
<p>When all was said and done, the world’s top teams visited China to make money. Who would really fight it out for real and compete with a country’s team which was backward in football? Furthermore, the players playing on the field were worried that they might be injured by their opponent’s intense actions, so their strength was naturally diminished.</p>
<p>As to whether the Chinese Football Association had any private deals with the teams that came to China, a poor citizen like Twain would not know. But now he had a firsthand experience.</p>
<p>Twain was not surprised by the kind of things that happened under the guise of the Olympics. After all, there had been scandals erupting from the national Olympic team and the national team in succession some time ago. The image of the Chinese football plummeted. Just as the Olympic Games were about to start, if they could tie with the world’s strong team, it would spur the fans, and also gather some confidence for the upcoming national Olympic team.</p>
<p>In this respect, it was entirely understandable that the Chinese Football Association wanted the game to be a draw. After all, these people had never regarded football as football. The laws of the football world were naturally nonsensical in their eyes. The football game in their mind should be subjected to their arrangements. Whether it was the outcome or the process, whether it was the environment or the players, coaches and referees… All had to obey them.</p>
<p>See Twain’s sudden silence, Allan did not continue. He waited for Twain to answer.</p>
<p>Twain came out of his thoughts. He lifted his eyes to look at Allan sitting opposite.</p>
<p>“Okay, Allan. I’ll be sure to extend this courtesy to them.” Twain winked at Allan and said with a smile.</p>
<p>Allan relaxed his shoulders and finally had a smile on his face.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest would only stay in China for five days, but there was a lot of things lined up for them and time was very tight. Aide Group and Allan arranged a very intensive trip for the Forest team. If an ordinary person were to see them, he would unconsciously think that these people would split their bodies into two.</p>
<p>On the evening of their arrival in Ningbo, the team would attend a welcome dinner reception hosted by the city government and then returned to the hotel to rest.</p>
<p>The next morning, the team would go to Ningbo Fubang Stadium for raining to adapt to the venue. This training session was open to the public, but bought tickets were required to go in and watch. The fares ranged from fifty to three hundred yuan, and the scalpers might sell them for even higher. Because there were Beckham, van Nistelrooy, van der Vaart, George Wood, Franck Ribéry… and so many other star players. Their appeal to the fans was a tool for the businessmen to make money.</p>
<p>After the team got changed when the morning’s training ended, the team would attend a luncheon hosted by a Chinese sponsor for this event. During the luncheon, Twain and Allan would sign a three-year brand endorsement deal on behalf of Nottingham Forest. Over the next three years, this company would be allowed to use the image of the Nottingham Forest team to do publicity in China.</p>
<p>After an afternoon of basic training, some people could go back to the hotel to rest, while the others were busy. Beckham was going to attend a promotional event for one of the brands he endorsed. Dunn was invited by China’s state television to record a program about his working life at the English Premier League champion, Nottingham Forest. Both George Wood and Tony Twain would attend together the signing ceremony for the construction of the Armani store on Heyi Avenue in Haishu District, Ningbo, because both men were Armani’s brand ambassadors. Today was only to sign the agreement. This store would only be completed for the consumers next April.</p>
<p>The players did not have to attend any events that night, and they could have a night of free activities. It was believed that by then most people would choose to go out and do some shopping together. But even so, they could not relax too much. It was also because many media would tag along the way and reports on how they spent their time and shopping would appear the next day on television, newspapers, on the Internet and other media platforms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Twain would follow the club’s top two executives, Evan and Allan to attend a celebrity gathering. Twain was the worst at this kind of activity, but he was unable to decline.</p>
<p>With no training on the third morning, all the players would have to dress up to visit the University of Nottingham’s Ningbo campus in Ningbo High Education Park. In the school’s stadium, the players played a little game with the local college students. For example, Beckham would teach the free kick and choose five players to have a simple one on one duel with the college students…</p>
<p>After a simple lunch at noon, the team would return to Fubang Stadium in the afternoon to continue the training open to public. The fans who bought tickets for the previous day’s training could enter directly with the tickets, and those who had lost or not bought them would have to purchase tickets again.</p>
<p>After the training, the players must immediately rush to Ningbo City Enmei Orphanage and to interact, give presents and care to the orphans there.</p>
<p>In the evening, after a quick dinner on the bus, the team would then rush to the television station and record a program with the lucky fans who had been selected, for about three and a half hours to four hours. By that time, it would already be late at night when these people headed back to the hotel exhausted.</p>
<p>They continued training on the fourth morning at Fubang Stadium, but this training was not open to the public. Because Twain would arrange detailed tactics for the evening’s game during this training session. By convention, such trainings were never public. Therefore, Aide Group did not sell tickets to this training session.</p>
<p>After lunch in the afternoon, the players would take a lunch break in the hotel to prepare for the evening game while Tony Twain had to attend a press conference. This was to launch the announcement of a partnership between Nottingham Forest and Zhejiang Greentown F.C., a local professional football club in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>In fact, to be frank, Greentown was the Forest team’s satellite club in China.</p>
<p>This was a big event involving football in Zhejiang Province, and Twain must attend.</p>
<p>After a simple dinner in the evening, the team would ride to Fubang Stadium, where the grand finale for their China trip was here—playing a friendly match with China’s National Olympic team, which had been training together for months, at Fubang Stadium in Ningbo City.</p>
<p>With Nottingham Forest winning the Champions League for the second year in a row as well as their Premier League title this year, they were The Double Winner and was unrivaled for a time. Their popularity in China also soared. Coupled with the game’s other team was the high-profile and highly anticipated by the locals, the China Olympic team, the tickets to the game sold like hot cakes. Originally, the Fubang Stadium could only accommodate thirty thousand spectators, so the organizers erected a special stand on the tracks. Thirty-five thousand out of forty thousand tickets sold, a result that should be considered good at a time when commercial football was getting less popular.</p>
<p>Aide Group suffered great losses on Real Madrid’s second visit to China a few years ago. This time at least they made it back with Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the fifth day, Nottingham Forest would pack up and fly directly from Ningbo Lishe International Airport to Tokyo, Japan. They would start their four days and four nights of frenetic money-making in Japan.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Based on the schedule seen above, these few days would be a tough test for the players— wrong, Beckham had such an experience, so he could cope easily—it was miserable for the others who were tired as a dog.</p>
<p>In front of people, under the limelight, under the glare of the camera lens, in front of the media’s pervasive attention, they smiled as they faced the various occasions and tirelessly signed autographs for the fans, satisfied their requests for a photo. They carefully protected their public image.</p>
<p>When they were doing charity at the orphanage, everyone was very serious, and no one was too tired to shirk their jobs. This was what made Twain the proudest. Beckham, in particular, was simply the best example to the other teammates. No matter how many people surrounded him and what kind of requests the fans had, he always smiled and tried his best to fulfill. He never showed the slightest sign of impatience while being observed by others due to fatigue.</p>
<p>In the orphanage, being the most famous, he was also the most popular with the children. In front of the children with mental challenges and physical disabilities, he treated them like he would with his own children.</p>
<p>George Wood was a little awkward, but he tried hard.</p>
<p>The players only had time to eat on their way to the television station. But many people simply did not have the appetite to eat. After getting on the bus, they waved to the children, fans and reporters outside the window. Till the bus was finally out of sight, these dedicated “actors” only then leaned back on their seats and slept one by one.</p>
<p>If these star players were to replay their trip to China in their minds in the summer of 2008, what would be the only thing that stayed in their minds?</p>
<p>Tired?</p>
<p>So tired…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 666 - Enough Face Has Been Given</p>
<p>A few days of commercial activities exhausted the players, but soon they would be free. They just needed to finish today’s game.</p>
<p>The China Olympic team’s challenge against Nottingham Forest had long been publicized to the point of being known to the world. Although Chinese football continued to be at a low ebb, the Chinese fans highly looked forward to this game.</p>
<p>Some people might just come to watch the Nottingham Forest star players perform, while some people came to watch the China Olympic team play. China would never lack these people. No matter how many people cursed, sneered and showed contempt towards Chinese football, there would always be a group of people who would consistently pay attention to Chinese football. The standards of the Chinese Super League was low, and the attendance rate was low but there was still attendance in the seats, which meant that people did watch. Went without saying, the national team’s games were almost full—there was certainly a patriotic element involved. It was not entirely due to football.</p>
<p>As the world’s number one sport, football had an extensive base of masses in China, but no organization could integrate and effectively manage these masses. Then the base would always only be the foundation, and there would never be a superstructure built on this basis.</p>
<p>The Chinese Football Association hoped to use this game to rekindle the people’s enthusiasm for football and ride on the wave of the Olympics to take Chinese football up a level. Twain understood the idea of such a covert operation, because the Chinese Football Association leaders were such single-celled organisms with such wishful thinking. But he himself was very dismissive of such a practice.</p>
<p>This put the cart before the horse. The fans’ enthusiasm for football would never ignite because of a commercial game. The level of Chinese football would never change because of what the China Olympic team could achieve in the Olympic Games. These should have been the logical and natural results of continuous developments in football, but the heads of the Chinese Football Association treated them as part of the process.</p>
<p>When Twain was younger, he had the dream that many fans dreamt of—a group of talented players who rose up and a talented manager who led them to the World Cup. Later, as he grew older and had experience, he thought that this would always remain only as a dream. The system would not reform, and Chinese football would never be the first.</p>
<p>FIFA’s regulation clearly stipulated that all the countries’ national football federations could not be government bodies and must be private organizations. The various countries’ governments could not interfere in the affairs of the Football Association, or they would be severely punished. But look at China, the Chinese Football Association came out to state that “We are a private organization.” Would anyone buy that? The General Administration of Sport of China above them was the first to say no. Every Chinese was clear about the nature of the General Administration of Sport as an institution. How could FIFA not know? But they could not help it either.</p>
<p>the only consolation for the Chinese fans was that occasionally one or two good players would play abroad and represent China on another stadium. If they did well at the clubs, it would also excite the Chinese fans.</p>
<p>The Chinese fans’ demands were that simple.</p>
<p>But even with such simple requirements, it was difficult to implement in reality.</p>
<p>So now most of the Chinese fans could only vent their frustrations through ridicule and admonishment. Now Twain was luckier than them because he had the opportunity to express his emotions in person and show enormous face to the Chinese Football Association leaders who specially came to watch the “command of the war” …</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>It rained every day for the four days in Ningbo. Yesterday’s weather forecast stated that there would be light rain today, and as expected, it rained continuously from last night until this afternoon.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, we are a team from England.” Twain looked at the drenched world outside the window and said to the coaches next to him. “This is a normal weather for us. How’s the turf?”</p>
<p>“A little slippery.” Dunn replied.</p>
<p>Twain slightly frowned. When the field was slippery, it was not easy to control the technical movements and some unexpected circumstances might arise when the bodies collided, greatly increasing the possibility of an injury.</p>
<p>Even though when he was a fan, Twain was displeased with those European powerhouse clubs who came to China to play and did not put in much effort on top of their players acting lethargically due to the fear of injury, this time he would arrange it as such. Even if Allan did not come to him, he would also keep his team’s strength. He would be the world’s biggest fool if he let his main players be injured in a commercial game in the faraway China.</p>
<p>The bus that the Forest team was on slowly drove on the road. The section of the road near the stadium was somewhat blocked due to the game. Ningbo mobilized a large number of traffic police to maintain order and the speed of vehicles was limited.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the CITIC Ningbo International Hotel where they stayed was very close to Fubang Stadium. They did not have to worry about being late even if the drive was slow as long as there was no traffic jam.</p>
<p>The experience of personally bringing the players to a game on the subway while they were still in League One was considered rare for Twain.</p>
<p>The fans could be seen either taking the taxis, the cars, or on foot to the stadium along the way. When they saw the Nottingham Forest bus, the fans inside the cars would excitedly lean out to wave and shout. China’s five-star red flag and the posters of the Nottingham Forest star players crisscrossed together, which complemented well—all the colors were red.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t… I would probably be one of them now.” Twain said to Dunn in Mandarin.</p>
<p>“Specially travel from Sichuan to Ningbo?”</p>
<p>“That’s not impossible… I had quit my job once before just to stay up late to watch the UEFA European Championship.” Twain said this with a very proud expression. He was not afraid of Dunn finding out about when he transmigrated from. He only said that it was the “UEFA European Championship.” There was the UEFA European Championship in 2000. As for his true age, he was still in school in 2002, but he never told Dunn, who also never asked about these very personal things. “Never underestimate the enthusiasm of the fans … Of course, never underestimate their anger.”</p>
<p>At the time of the game, the Forest players regained their professional player status and acted like they were going to play in an away league game. Only a handful of the young ones who were brought from the youth team curiously took out their digital video cameras to capture the spectacular “yellow tide” outside the window.</p>
<p>In fact, the team’s coaching unit for this game did not make any arrangements at all. These days the training was mainly based on physical recovery and simple tactical exercises. There was no special training held to deal with the China Olympic team. The team’s overall training plan was to prepare for the new season of the league tournament and European competition. Twain did not even gather the players for a tactical meeting before the game. There was enough to speak in the locker room.</p>
<p>Due to the proximity, Nottingham Forest set out right on time. By the time they arrived at Fubang Stadium, the players of the China Olympic team had already left the locker room one by one to warm up on the field.</p>
<p>“They’re in high fighting spirits.” Twain looked at those men and whistled.</p>
<p>“Because we are the strongest out of all their friendlies’ opponents.” Dunn said, “For them, this game is more valuable than their previous friendlies.”</p>
<p>“It will be even more valuable to them if they defeat us by accident.” Twain winked at Dunn.</p>
<p>“Impossible.” Dunn, the Chinese man, poured cold water on Twain in all seriousness.</p>
<p>“Allan will be very angry if he hears you say that… Ha ha!” Twain laughed. It looked like he was in a good mood. “But you’re right. Even if we don’t work hard, it’s not hard to win them. Fourteen years ago, Chinese football might have defeated those opponents which underestimated them. But now this team certainly won’t be able to. Everything develops, but it’s strange that this rule doesn’t apply at all in Chinese football.” He shook his head.</p>
<p>“Don’t let them dawdle. Better hurry and go warm up.” He turned his head and said to Kerslake, so the assistant manager’s loud voice rang out in the locker room.</p>
<p>“Don’t think you can relax just because it’s a friendly match! You will equally suffer from lack of warm-up! Does anyone want the new season to be over before it has started?”</p>
<p>His bark was effective. The players who took their own sweet time just now to while away the time, immediately dashed out.</p>
<p>Twain did not stay in the locker room to prepare as there was not much to prepare. There was no need to study the China Olympic team to play against their opponent. As long as they played according to their tackles and usual habits, this game would be in their hands.</p>
<p>He felt like he had “returned in glory.” Deep down, he wanted to go out and show off. Although no one would recognized him as a Chinese man and the Chinese people would not be envious of his achievements, this did not stop him from fantasizing in his mind for self-entertainment. To think that I was just an ordinary young fan at that time. Now I have brought a two-time Champions League Double Winner team back to China!</p>
<p>As it rained for several days, the organizers were worried for a while that the fans who had bought tickets would not come to the game. But what Twain saw should give the organizers a sigh of relief. Half of the forty thousand seats had occupied by now, and it was forty minutes away from the start of the game.</p>
<p>The drizzle did not dampen the enthusiasm of the fans at all. Even when the players from both sides came out to warm up, they were happily shouting in the stands.</p>
<p>Looking at them, he thought about the all kinds of fans he had met in England. Suddenly, Twain lost the interest to “show off” outside. He turned back to the locker room.</p>
<p>Just as he walked into the tunnel entrance, he was stopped by a group of Chinese reporters. They wanted to interview this legendary manager, who was full of personality. The person who came out to ask the question was Tang Jing, an old acquaintance of Twain.</p>
<p>“I really can meet you anywhere, Miss Tang.” Twain greeted her in Mandarin.</p>
<p>“I’m the reporter, specially put in charge to cover you and your team. It would be strange if you don’t see me.” Tang Jing shook her head and then threw out her question. “Before the game, the fans were worried that such a commercial game would greatly discount the value of the competition. In terms of the viewing pleasure or the competitive nature, it is not as good as the usual game. What do you think?” ”</p>
<p>“This game is definitely not the same as the league cups. But I don’t agree with the remarks that it would be unexciting. Because excitement can be divided into several kinds. A massive victory of 7:0 against the opponent can also be wonderful to watch.” Twain winked at Tang Jing.</p>
<p>“Oh? Are you saying your team will score a lot of goals in the game?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that. It’s just an analogy. Don’t try to manipulate my meaning to that direction.” Twain was well aware of the reporter’s antics. “I don’t know how the game is going to be played out. I can only promise that we will try our best to let the Chinese fans enjoy a wonderful game. We are different from those European teams which come here just to make money. Don’t forget that we are also the cultural ambassador for Nottingham. This game is a great opportunity to showcase the English football culture. And, you know, Miss Tang, I never put my hands up in surrender before a game.”</p>
<p>Hearing Twain said so, Tang Jing smiled. Having said so much useless officialese mumbo jumbo earlier, this last sentence held the real truth. It was really hard to get Twain to give up before the game even started.</p>
<p>“So, this means the Chinese fans and television viewers can enjoy a great game with confidence?”</p>
<p>“That’s the way it looks.”</p>
<p>Twain and Tang Jing had a happy exchange and the other Chinese reporters were not willing to be left out, so they stepped forward to ask their own questions. The biggest advantage of interviewing Twain was that both parties could communicate directly in Mandarin without any translation, which made is less troublesome.</p>
<p>“What do you think of the strength of the China Olympic team, Mr. Twain?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know much about this team…” In fact, I know a lot, but I won’t tell you!</p>
<p>“There are rumors that you guys are interested in Zheng Zhi. Can you please confirm if that’s true?”</p>
<p>“If Zheng Zhi can accept to be George Wood’s substitute, I don’t mind.” Twain grinned. They just needed to understand George Wood to know that this was equal to a denial of the rumor.</p>
<p>“Do you have any expectations for the Beijing Olympics?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I can’t come to Beijing to watch the Olympics in person because the English Premier League will have already started at that time. But I believe the Beijing Olympic Games will be an unforgettable Olympic Games.” Twain answered the question with a smile. He was polite, gracious, humorous and gave off a good impression. It was hard for the Chinese reporters who first came into contact with him to believe that this man had a bad reputation in Europe.</p>
<p>Only Tang Jing knew that the outer appearance of this man was completely untrustworthy.</p>
<p>The group of Chinese reporters soon saw Tony Twain’s other side.</p>
<p>An attractive television female reporter squeezed in and asked, “Beckham is in the starting lineup. I would like to know if he will be playing in the entire game?”</p>
<p>“It depends on the situation. Generally, we will make to make a large-scale adjustment.” As this was not a regular game, the substitutions was discussed and agreed between the two sides. Because the China Olympic team wanted to train its players, so everyone decided that they could replace eleven players.</p>
<p>“In other words, it mean Beckham will be replaced midway?”</p>
<p>Twain began to find this female reporter very annoying for asking questions that lacked standards and rudimentary. His warm tone quickly cooled. “I can’t answer you now.”</p>
<p>The female reporter did not sense any dissatisfaction in Twain’s tone and continued to throw out her prepared questions, “Do you think David Beckham’s role in the team is very important?”</p>
<p>Twain finally could not help himself. He asked the reporter in a stern tone, “Lady, I’m not happy with the way you give your interviewees presupposed questions and answers. I can only answer ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Or do you want me to give you answers that you want to hear? I’m sorry, but I refuse to answer this question. Besides, you’re an entertainment reporter, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Twain’s sudden outburst left the reporters in the room stunned, including the female reporter. She had covered many events in China and always asked such questions. No one had ever said that she asked the wrong questions and badly.</p>
<p>For example: “Do you feel glorious and proud to win the gold medal? Do the coach and the team help you a lot? Are you so excited that you want to cry?”</p>
<p>“Do you feel sorry that you only won a silver medal? Do you feel you have let down the country for your training over the years?”</p>
<p>“Congratulations on running your best time for this year. Liu Xiang won the championship title. Do you feel very happy? What do you think of Liu Xiang’s performance today?”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But today, this man was actually merciless in refuting her. She could not wrap her head around this for a moment.</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m not an entertainment reporter.” It took her a long while to answer this inexplicable question.</p>
<p>“You should be an entertainment reporter. You are very talented in that area.” Having said that, Twain walked away and left behind an awkward silence for all the Chinese reporters present in his wake.</p>
<p>Tang Jing saw this scene in the back of the crowd and shrugged her shoulders. She knew things would develop this way …</p>
<p>The displeased Twain quickly walked through the tunnel. When he passed by the home team, the China Olympic team’s locker room door, this door just closed. The action caught his eye and he turned his head over. In that instant, he caught a glimpse of a familiar figure through the door—the Chinese Football Association President, Xie Guanlong.</p>
<p>It was said that Dujković was just an overall head coach by name only for a long time. The Chinese coaching team was just a puppet, only responsible for conveying the instructions and spirit from above. Now it seemed like the rumor was not false.</p>
<p>A glimpse of this scene made Twain laugh. Chinese football was full of jokes. With a track and field background, Xie Guanlong put on an act to arrange the tactics and command the team’s game Then a group of professional coaches bowed their heads and listened, while continuously nodded in agreement. On top of that, they would fawn on and flatter that “the president is really an expert”, “President Xie’s words are correct” … He felt it was very funny just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he did not have to suffer in such an environment.</p>
<p>This interlude suddenly improved his mood.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The players returned to the locker room after the warm-up. They dried their perspiration and changed into clean clothes.</p>
<p>Twain saw that they had all done this before he spoke up, “With regards to this game … there’s nothing much to say. We will play as we usually play.”</p>
<p>Eastwood stood up and asked, “Chief, is it still defensive counterattack?”</p>
<p>“We don’t just know how to play defensive counterattack!” Twain glared at him, “We are going to practice and train with the offense from the middle routine today. We’re not going from the wings, only in the middle. If the Chinese team comes out punching, we will need to defend more fiercely. Take this opportunity to score a goal against them and start practicing the offense again.”</p>
<p>The players nodded. The middle was an area where all the teams paid more attention to. Whether offensively or defensively there must be more players here. The Forest team had little chance to practice specifically during normal games because they had to win, and it was obviously more effective to play in the wings. Now in the face of such an opponent like the China Olympic team, it would be a waste of opportunity not to use it as a practice of the tactics, but to play the flank attack which they were best at.</p>
<p>“But I want to remind you.” Twain held out his left index finger and said, “Everyone must be aware of the weather and the field conditions with the warm-up just now. The Chinese team will fight fiercely. You have to be careful not to let yourselves get hurt. Don’t go and intercept the more difficult balls from the opponent. When they have bigger movements, just avoid them. Protect yourselves.”</p>
<p>Everyone on the starting list bobbed their heads. Twain gave face to everyone with the starting list for today’s game—almost all of the main force were in the lineup.</p>
<p>The goalkeeper was van der Sar. The center backs were the partners, Piqué and Ayala. The left back was Gareth Bale and the right back was Rafinha. The defensive midfielder was Sun Jihai and the attacking midfielder was van der Vaart. The left midfielder was Ribéry and the right midfielder was David Beckham. The strikers were van Nistelrooy and Eastwood.</p>
<p>The center back, Pepe has been sidelined due to a minor injury because Twain wanted to be careful. Even though George Wood did not have any injuries, Twain put him on the bench. In fact, Twain had his own plans for this arrangement …</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the same time, in the China Olympic team’s locker room, Xie Guanlong had just guest performed as a manager and arranged the tactics for the China Olympic players. Truthfully, his tactics were very simple, nothing but some terms which a fake fan would know—“Must have a solid defense and quick counterattack. The front field will then begin to force an interception, attack from the both sides. The ball is heavier on a rainy day, so strengthen the long shots …”</p>
<p>After he gave these seemingly professional instructions which in fact amounted to perfunctory nonsense, he began his favorite ideological mobilization which was the motivation of the players before a game.</p>
<p>“Players! It’s a rare opportunity to be able to play against the UEFA Champions League champion. The Chinese Football Association has worked hard to obtain this opportunity for everyone, so I hope you all will cherish it.” He put one hand on the hip and the other hand with his five fingers slightly spread as he brandished his hand, looking every inch like a leader. He said, “We’re definitely not as good as our opponents in this game, but I hope you don’t give up. You’re going to play your own style! Firstly, we must have momentum! Our strength is weaker than the opponent, but if our momentum is worse than the opponent, then we cannot play this game! We have to scare them! We must show a tenacious fighting spirit, ferociously tackle and have bigger movements. As long as the opponent is afraid, the situation of the game will be to our advantage!”</p>
<p>He spoke energetically here while the manager, Dujković sat in the corner, looking indifferent. It was as if everything that happened here had nothing to do with him. In effect, it did not really matter. He was just a figurehead and could not do anything since he had no power. To put it nicely, he was just a spectator who was able to sit in the technical area.</p>
<p>“Secondly, we must not give up! Don’t give up the game under any circumstances! The style of Chinese football is we never give up till the last second!” Xie Guanlong was high-spirited, as if his team had won the game. However, did he not blush when he said those words? … “If the other side scores a goal, we will try our best to grab and mess up their rhythm! Then we strive to equalize the score sooner. You must be fierce during the defense. We use our fighting spirit and tenacity as well as proactivity to make up for our technical disadvantage!”</p>
<p>“Finally, I hope you can give the fans in the entire country a wonderful game and let the fans see the spirit shown in you! The Party and the people are watching you and hope you can deliver a satisfactory result!”</p>
<p>After he irresponsibly threw the heavy burden of 1.3 billion people’s expectations on the shoulders of these regular players, Xie Guanlong left the locker room accompanied by the other officials with ease and confidence. He felt extremely good just thinking about that result and the impassioned speech he gave before the game.</p>
<p>Back on the podium, after he shook hands with the Nottingham Forest’s chairman, Evan Doughty and Marketing Manager, Allan Adams, he sat next to the two men and got ready to watch the game.</p>
<p>In the stands opposite the podium, there were fans who displayed a banner “Xie * Long should be fired!” Give Dujković back!”. However, he swept his gaze across and pretended not to see it.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The players from both sides came out in a file and the atmosphere at the stadium began to heat up. The live broadcast announced the players from both sides one by one. All the China Olympic team and the Nottingham Forest star players received the most enthusiastic applause and cheers from the spectators. Beckham was certainly the most popular.</p>
<p>Because George Wood was not here, it should have been the second captain, van der Sar who came up to pick for the coin toss. Since it was not an official game, but a commercial one, Twain gave Beckham the captain’s armband from a commercial point of view. This move proved to be welcomed. When Beckham with the captain’s armband was spotted in the center circle doing the coin toss with the China Olympic team captain, Li Weifeng, the fans in the stadium broke out with loud cheers.</p>
<p>Beckham lost to Li Weifeng during the coin toss and won the right to kick off.</p>
<p>After a group photo of the starting lineup, the players on both sides returned to their respective positions. The main referee from China whistled and the game officially began!</p>
<p>Once the game started, the fans in the stands really gave their energy to rally. The majority of them cheered on the China Olympic team. Because Twain heard clearly what they shouted, “China team, come on! China team, keep fighting!”</p>
<p>Any fan who often watched the Chinese team play live on the television would be familiar with this sound, and Twain was no exception. It looked like no matter how popular Nottingham Forest was in China, no matter how big Beckham’s appeal was, as long as the opponent was the China Olympic team, then it would be almost impossible for the fans to cheer for the Forest team.</p>
<p>It was Twain had stated when the game started. The morale of the China Olympic team was very strong. Although they did not control the ball, they were aggressive with the tackles. Any successful defense would gain cheers from the stands. However, in Twain’s view, this performance was bold but not very astute. The “head coach” who made such an arrangement was very incompetent.</p>
<p>The China Olympic team would inevitably consume a lot of physical strength with such fierce interception. Moreover, they could not take care of every corner of the field, especially in the rear defensive line where a lot of gaps could be taken advantage of. The Nottingham Forest team was just waiting for a suitable opportunity to strike a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest did not have to wait long for this opportunity. Nottingham Forest, with most of its main force deployed, easily controlled the pace of the game. The China Olympic team began to follow the pace of the Forest team. They ran vigorously but also energetically used up a lot of physical strength, which actively opened up gaps for the Forest team.</p>
<p>In the sixth minute, Beckham spotted the right timing to suddenly kick off a cross pass to the penalty area. Van Nistelrooy and Eastwood attracted the attention of all the China Olympic team defenders. Van der Vaart, who was left unmarked, plugged into the penalty area from the back and volleyed a shot in the air without stopping the ball!</p>
<p>If it was a more important game, he might steady and stop the ball before he made a move. But in such a game, the China Olympic team did not give him any pressure, so he had the mind to execute a move with a high degree of difficulty which was not commonly used. And it worked very well…</p>
<p>“The ball’s in! Alas, a gap that shouldn’t have been there appeared in the defense of the China Olympic team…” The commentator of China’s national television station appeared frustrated. It was known that the strength of the two teams was not on the same level, but the China Olympic team represented China. It was really embarrassing for them to concede a goal so soon.</p>
<p>When they saw that the goal was in, the Forest players celebrated minimally. Twain and the others in the technical area did not even get up and clapped. For these people, it was normal to score a goal against the Chinese team. It was not worth celebrating at all.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After taking the lead, Nottingham Forest deliberately slowed down the pace and began to follow the guidelines that Twain had set up before the game. When there were opportunities to attack, they would attack in the middle without exception, even if the China Olympic team put all the defensive forces in the middle. Even if this led to a sharp decline in the success rate of the offense, they did not intend to try the flanks.</p>
<p>While the trailing China Olympic team strengthened its tackles amid the fans’ cheers. As they were over-excited, their movements got bigger and bigger, forcing the Nottingham Forest players to give up the ball several times to avoid the other side’s ferocious shovels.</p>
<p>This made the Forest players a little disgruntled. The commercial game was increasingly becoming explosive.</p>
<p>Finally, in the twenty-first minute, the China Olympic team’s striker, Gao Lin, received Zheng Zhi’s pass in the penalty area when he suddenly fell to the ground. The referee decided to award a penalty! The Nottingham Forest players felt very wronged. Even though Piqué and Gao Lin had physical contact, it was an exaggeration to rule it as a foul. He could not always whistled for a penalty as long as the opposing striker had physical contact with the defender in the penalty area and fell to the ground, could he?</p>
<p>The referee ignored the protests of the Forest players and insisted on the verdict.</p>
<p>Twain smiled when he saw this scene off the field. Did the Chinese Football Association also double up on the insurance?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Zheng Zhi scored with this penalty shot. The score became a tie at 1:1.</p>
<p>The gongs and drums thundered in the stands and the fans were extremely happy to be able to equalize the scores. The players of the China Olympic team were also affected by this, becoming more excited and aggressive with their actions.</p>
<p>The Forest players soon found a problem. The two teams fought hard and when the Chinese team players fell after any physical contact, the referee would penalize the Forest team for fouls most of the time. The China Olympic team led by a wide margin with the number of free kicks in the first half.</p>
<p>When Ayala skirted around from the back to defend and took the ball off the feet of Zheng Zhi who was glancing around, Zheng Zhi fell to the ground and the referee whistled that he fouled again. The Argentine veteran shook his head helplessly as he stood on the spot with his hands on his hips.</p>
<p>As a result, the Nottingham Forest players played more and more passively. When they attacked in the face of the Chinese team’s defense which bordered on fouling, they played nervously. During their defense, they dared not to make a move lightly because they were afraid of being penalized for a foul. In this way, the Chinese team regained the initiative on the field.</p>
<p>When the Forest team controlled the ball, they preferred to pass the ball back and forth in the center and back field, rather than pass the ball forward. Such a move upset the fans who came to watch the game. They wanted to see both sides pit themselves against each other in the attacks and not a passive game. As a result, the boos against Nottingham Forest began to emerge in the stands. As soon as they started passing the ball to each other laterally, the hissing would immediately erupt.</p>
<p>And the China Olympic team, who strove to compete, naturally got the one-sided enthusiastic support.</p>
<p>Everyone’s thinking was this—since Nottingham Forest is not willing to give their best and doesn’t want to play seriously with a team like us, then we will defeat and embarrass you!</p>
<p>In the second part of the first half, the China Olympic team began to gain the upper hand. There was even a siege on the Forest goal, leading to a dangerous situation in the goal guarded by van der Sar. Seeing such a scene, the grandstand naturally broke out in thunderous cheers. In the podium, Xie Guanlong was also full of smiles.</p>
<p>In the technical area, Kerslake could not sit still. It was strange that Twain, who was a fussy person, stayed calm in the tense situation, crossed his legs, and did not seem worried about the team’s plight.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest paid the price for their passive play before the end of the first half. Zheng Zhi unexpectedly did a long shot. The football hit Sun Jihai on the thigh, which deflected the shot and caused it to fly into the net. Van der Sar could only sigh as he watched the ball.</p>
<p>In this instant, the decibel at the Fubang Stadium reached the highest level since it was built.</p>
<p>Xie Guanlong even stood up and clapped. The players of the China Olympic team hugged excitedly. They completely suppressed Nottingham Forest in the second part of the first half. And now they were ahead of the European champions! It would be hard to tell these young people not to get excited.</p>
<p>As for Twain? He just turned his head to the restless Kerslake next to him and said, “You should be happy. The first half is about to end, and we don’t have anyone hurt.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>During the halftime interval, the China Olympic team players ran off the field with their heads held high and their chests puffed up as they received cheers from the fans along the way. While the Nottingham Forest players went off the field a little helplessly with their heads bowed. They would hear the boos from the stands occasionally.</p>
<p>It was no wonder the attitude of these fans who were still pursuing the Forest players before the game had turned one hundred and eighty degrees. People had high hopes for Nottingham Forest, which had the titles of the Champions League champion and Double Winner, in the first half, but did not play at the level which everyone wanted to see. How could this not be disappointing? Since they were disappointed, they naturally had to fully express for the English team to see.</p>
<p>The director of the television broadcast was clearly aware of Twain’s position. When the players came off the field, the camera turned to Twain, but was surprised to find that Twain was not dissatisfied with this result and the team’s performance at all, which was really puzzling. Was it not a rumor that he could accept a loss, but could not accept a loss that was cowardly and had no fighting spirit?</p>
<p>What about now…</p>
<p>How would these people know how Twain’s mind worked?</p>
<p>On the podium, Xie Guanlong left his seat with a smile on his face as he went to the locker room to inspect the team again. He was delighted by the team’s performance in the first half and the reaction of the fans in the stadium made him even happier.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Everyone was already in the locker room when Twain came in and closed the door.</p>
<p>He did not criticize the players at all. Instead, he smiled and said, “You’ve done a good job, and no one was hurt. I’m relieved.”</p>
<p>But his players disagreed with his view. Eastwood stood up in frustration, “Chief, I can’t accept this result at all.”</p>
<p>His comments were quickly echoed and concurred by most of his teammates.</p>
<p>“Oh? Why?” Twain pretended to be surprised, “Not getting hurt in a friendly match is the most important. I think there is no reason to fight for such a game.”</p>
<p>“You’re right, Chief. But I just can’t accept this result and the awkward situation. Every time I heard the boos in the stands, I don’t feel good.” Eastwood, who was usually smiling, now looked serious. “We’re the European champions, aren’t we? We’re the Double Winner, right? If we played a little more seriously, the first half would be 3-0. To be honest…”</p>
<p>Eastwood hesitated slightly and decided to speak his mind, “… I don’t like this kind of competition. It’s like being on a show and giving the results the spectators want to see. I prefer the real Champions League final to this kind of commercial game!”</p>
<p>Having said that, he looked up and waited for the chief’s criticism. But Twain smiled and did not intend to scold him at all.</p>
<p>“But I think the outcome and situation of a commercial game is insignificant. As compared to that little bit of dignity, I value your health more. We can’t choose whether to play in this kind of competition. As our reputation grows, there will be more of such similar games. But we can choose the way we play…”</p>
<p>Eastwood was set to vent his frustrations suffered from the first half today. He knew the chief liked him, so he was a little unchecked. “I remember, Chief, that you said to us before that the way to finish the game early was to completely wipe out the opponent at the start of the game. Why can’t we be like that in this game? Anyway, I think this kind of game is an insult to my work ethic.”</p>
<p>He was a little heavy handed with his remarks, but Twain was still not angry. He looked at the players with a smile.</p>
<p>“I think, chief… I can guess what these Chinese newspapers will say about us the next day, and it will not be good, that’s for sure.” A second man stood up and it was Pepe, who did not play because of his injury. He shrugged his shoulders and grimaced, “I don’t want other people to look down on us.”</p>
<p>“Boss, we know what a commercial game is. But there is no rule in the commercial game that we have to lose to the hosts.”</p>
<p>“The referee of this game kept blowing the whistle and every situation was against us. I want to teach them a lesson!”</p>
<p>“It was hard to play in the first half. Football is not meant to be played like this!”</p>
<p>More and more people bravely stood up against their king, but the smile on Twain’s face widened.</p>
<p>“So, you don’t want to lose this game?”</p>
<p>“Who was the one who told us that Nottingham Forest’s football is to never say die and admit defeat. Chief?” Eastwood looked directly at Twain and asked.</p>
<p>Twain finally laughed, “I knew you people won’t take it lying down. Actually, I think… Of course, I don’t want to lose, but I don’t really want you to get hurt. You all saw the opponent’s actions. I do not want to wait for someone to get hurt before I start regretting. You must also think about your own bodies.”</p>
<p>“At the start of the second half, I’ll make big adjustments in the players. I will replace all eleven players. But!” He raised his voice, “You’re right, Nottingham Forest’s football is to never say die and admit defeat. I will never accept failure, let alone this kind of failure! We are clearly able to beat them, so let’s beat them!”</p>
<p>Among the crowd of excited people, Sun Jihai began to pray for his fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Twain bared his lips and grinned happily as he looked at the confidence and fighting spirit that everyone had to win the game.</p>
<p>The only regret was that he could not see the change of expression on the faces of those Chinese Football Association heads in the second half. You must have had a good laugh in the first half, didn’t you?</p>
<p>Allan, I have given you enough face. In the first half, they were one goal ahead of the main lineup. Such a good thing is not easy even for Manchester United, Real Madrid and other big teams to encounter.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 667 - Stupid and Awesome</p>
<p>As the players from both teams stood near the center circle waiting for the second half to begin, Twain changed four players in one go. Four players clad in Nottingham Forest’s yellow away jerseys stood on the sidelines, waiting in line to get on the field.</p>
<p>Kompany replaced the older Ayala, Akinfeev substituted van der Sar, Lennon swapped out David Beckham, and George Wood replaced Sun Jihai.</p>
<p>Beckham’s exit made the fans unhappy with Twain and they booed him constantly.</p>
<p>“They’re not booing at you, David.” When Beckham walked off to shake Twain’s hand, Twain laughed, “The boos are for me. They are complaining that I’ve brought you off too early.”</p>
<p>“I understand, boss.”</p>
<p>“Well, dry yourself.” He personally handed over a towel himself.</p>
<p>Wood took over the captain’s armband from Beckham. He tied it himself, and then ran onto the field. He did not give his opinion on how they should play in the first half during the halftime interval. But Twain knew this kid must have bottled up a lot of energy inside.</p>
<p>During the halftime interval, Twain instructed the team to step up their long shots and still play offense in the middle. Apart from the players’ fear of injury and the referee’s whistle, they were unable to break the goal in the first half partly due to Twain’s instruction to the team to attack from the middle. But he did not change that in the second half. In addition to this being a hard-to-get opportunity to train the players, Twain did not think that they could not breach the goal by attacking from the middle with Nottingham Forest’s ability.</p>
<p>In fact, even if the main players did not make noise during the halftime interval, Twain also had a way to reverse the situation in the second half. Hence, he specially kept the substitutes for the second half. These players usually played less, and very eager to prove themselves, which in some cases were more powerful than the main players. Twain had planned from the start to let them play in the second half to teach the heads of the Chinese Football Association a lesson.</p>
<p>That was right. He did not plan to listen to Allan in the first place and to give face to the Chinese Football Association. The Chinese Football Association’s reputation had nothing to do with him. At that time, he did not directly refuse Allan only because he did not want to quarrel with him. His hot-headedness and outspoken personality did not mean that he would not resort to petty tricks.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>While the China Olympic team’s players and most of the fans were still oblivious from the dream of the first half, van der Vaart’s long shot that struck the goal post had sounded the alarm.</p>
<p>In the fifth minute of the second half, less than a minute after van der Vaart’s long shot hit the post, Ribéry suddenly cut inside after he dribbled the ball in the wing. He kicked the ball in a straight line just before the China Olympic team thought he was going to do a long shot. Plugging in from the side, Eastwood turned to shoot at the goal after he received the ball, which rolled past the goalkeeper who was unable to react in time and hit the net.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest reversed the score.</p>
<p>So far, it was still in line with the result that Xie Yalong and Allan knew.</p>
<p>However, a bad feeling about this emerged in Allan’s mind.</p>
<p>In the eleventh minute, Li Weifeng whose defensive action was still rough, pushed down Lennon who had intended to break through in front of the penalty area, the referee blew the whistle and ruled that it was his foul, which gave the Forest team a free kick twenty-seven meters from the goal.</p>
<p>Gareth Bale stepped forward to execute this free kick and the football drew a beautiful arc to fly straight toward a dead corner!</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest completed the reversal of the game in six minutes.</p>
<p>After this goal, Twain substituted the players again. Bale, who scored the goal was replaced by Baines, van der Vaart was replaced by Petrov and Ribéry moved to the middle to be the playmaker in the midfield.</p>
<p>Following which, Petrov who just came on the field, brutally broke through the wing. After he relied on his speed to break past the China Olympic team’s defenders marking him, he sent out the ball. Van Nistelrooy suppressed Li Weifeng to head the football into the goal.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, the score had changed from 1:2 to 4:2.</p>
<p>While sitting on the podium, Xie Yalong’s smile on his face was long gone. His face was now infinitely close to Ningbo’s weather today.</p>
<p>Allan sat in next to Evan Doughty and was one person down from Xie Yalong. He could feel the emotional upheaval that took place in the Chinese Football Association President’s mind at this moment. Because he was also a little annoyed.</p>
<p>Tony Twain made a fool out of him!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it was acceptable for the hosts for this score to be kept until the end of the game. After all, they had scored two goals against the European Champion and the other party only scored four goals. But Twain had no intention of giving up. He continued to bring on the driven players to attack the already battered and disheartened China Olympic team.</p>
<p>Bendtner came onto replace van Nistelrooy and Arshavin replaced Eastwood. Rafinha was replaced by Chimbonda and Wes Morgan replaced Piqué. The China Olympic team simply could not threaten Nottingham Forest’s defense now. Most of their faltering attacks were stopped by George Wood, who defended against them with ease.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest scored two more goals in the final minutes of the game. Bendtner grabbed the ball in the penalty area to score a goal. Then he used his strong physique and followed up with a header shot to the goal.</p>
<p>By the time the Forest team scored their fifth goal, half of the fans had already started cheering and applauding the Forest players for each performance.</p>
<p>In contrast to this situation, Xie Yalong’s face was gloomy with tightly pursed lips, looking as ugly as could be.</p>
<p>The players of the China Olympic team still strove at the beginning. But toward the end, they realized that the difference in the strength between the two sides was just too big, so they just gave up trying. Their attacks were completely disorganized, and they struggled with the defense.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, Twain shook his head and said, “This is all they’ve got, and the FA actually gave them the goal to reach the final four of the Olympic men’s soccer…”</p>
<p>“Are they crazy?” Dunn asked.</p>
<p>“Not crazy, this is their usual stance. If you were to hear the FA say we have to keep our feet on the ground and do something practical for Chinese football one day, you can call the mental hospital and ask them to send a car to the FA to get those people.”</p>
<p>Dunn was amused by Twain’s words.</p>
<p>But Twain glanced at him and said, “Is that funny? Don’t you think it’s sad and indignant to have encountered such a thing? But the Chinese fans have lost their energy for anger and swearing. They can only express their emotions in a sarcastic manner. You see…” He pointed to the stands and muttered, “how almost all of them are starting to boo the China Olympic team now. That’s how they express their emotions. They are forced to the extent that they see no hope at all. Who would want to use this extreme way to vent? To boo the team that wears their own country flag on the chest… It’s sad and pathetic.”</p>
<p>Dunn stopped laughing and was silent. His understanding and feelings about Chinese football were lagged behind this “British man” next to him. But he could imagine what Twain’s former attitude towards Chinese football was. Perhaps he cried, laughed, cursed and hoped too. But now, he coolly recounted other people’s own affairs here.</p>
<p>It was so sad and pathetic.</p>
<p>And so lamentable!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The commercial match ended with Nottingham Forest’s 6:2 victory over the China Olympic team. After the game, all the Forest players walked hand in hand toward the stands to thank the fans, which was their tradition and what Twain asked them to do.</p>
<p>Initially, these players thought that since they had slaughtered the home team without giving any face, those who booed them in the first half would boo at them even louder. But to their surprise and what touched them was the Chinese fans stood up in the stands to applaud the Nottingham Forest players who had played to their best during the match.</p>
<p>“To be honest, they understand the game very well…” Sun Jihai muttered when he thanked the fans with his teammates.</p>
<p>The people on the other team felt bad. Xie Yalong stood on the podium and clapped out of courtesy. Some eager fans already rushed out a new placard and raised it up in the stands below the podium to show to the officials on the podium.</p>
<p>“Xie Yalong is a stupid c**t! The FA is a stupid c**t!”</p>
<p>This slogan captured what all the fans in the stadium wanted to say.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The post-match press conference was lively. Because Nottingham Forest was the first team to beat the host team to a pulp since China had commercial football matches, this game set the records for the highest score for a single game and net goal difference for a foreign team over a Chinese team.</p>
<p>In accordance with the traditional thinking of the Chinese people, guests who came to visit the host, must pay mind to the host’s face. It was okay to win but it looked better for everyone to score less goals…</p>
<p>But Tony Twain and his Nottingham Forest team did not believe in this.</p>
<p>Twain’s first remark astonished the Chinese reporters present, “I was not satisfied with the team’s performance in the first half. We should have scored a few more goals. But I’m fairly satisfied with the current overall score. We showed the strength of a European champion in the second half.”</p>
<p>Twain knew some of the Chinese media would feel displeased, but he had his own way to shut them up.</p>
<p>“Before the game, there were some media which were concerned that the Forest team would not give its best to play in the commercial game, making the game less thrilling to watch. But now I think everyone can put their minds at ease. We’re a professional team and we upheld our work ethic. I’m very happy to give the Chinese fans such a wonderful game!” He smiled and opened his arms, looking very proud. “After the game, the Chinese fans gave my team a standing ovation and I was deeply moved by that. It also showed that we have won the recognition and appreciation of the fans with practical actions! The Chinese fans are…” He gave a thumbs-up and spoke in authentic Mandarin, “Awesome!”</p>
<p>His words and conduct rendered the media which were ready to make trouble, completely speechless.</p>
<p>Only Tang Jing was laughing below. That’s Tony Twain for you. You don’t know if you should love him or hate him… But whether you like him or not, he’s true to himself in front of you. Those whose hearts can’t take it; he may just be the death of you.</p>
<p>I would have fought him before when I was younger. But now when I see him, I can only smile when I see him. I really don’t get worked up by him anymore because he’s not directing it at me at all… Maybe he’s directing it at the world?</p>
<p>The puppet, Mr. Dujković had nothing to say as this match had nothing to do with him. But he had to stepped out after the game to accept everyone’s rebuke. The salary given by the Chinese Football Association was really not easy to earn. . . . . . “They played very well, and we tried our best. But the difference in the strength is too wide and we are powerless…” He rubbed his temples as he feebly answered the reporters’ questions, as if he was muttering to himself.</p>
<p>Twain glanced at him and did not think that this old man was pathetic.</p>
<p>If I were him, how could I endure such humiliation? I would have yelled at the Football Association long ago, and then got up to walk away. You can go find whoever is willing to play along. I’m not going to do as you say!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the end of their last assignment in China, the players were given a break that night. They were free to go out and do what they like before 11:30 P.M..</p>
<p>While Tony Twain was invited by Allan to his room once again. There were some things that they had to make clear.</p>
<p>Unlike the last time, the club chairman, Evan Doughty was present in the room this time.</p>
<p>“The atmosphere doesn’t feel quite right.” He did not rush in. Instead, he clung to the door frame, looked inside at the two men and asked tentatively.</p>
<p>“Ah, Tony, Tony. What should I say about you?” Allan shook his head and sighed. There were times when he really could not get angry with this manager. During the game, he was so angry that he could not wait to look for Twain to question him in person what he was doing. But seeing him like this now, all the yelling he was prepared to do had vanished.</p>
<p>Twain quickly laughed, “It’s ok. I know why you’re looking for me. Actually, Allan, don’t blame me for lying to you. If I had refused in the first place, then the itinerary and various activities you had arranged these days would be affected. Isn’t that the case when you calmly think about it?”</p>
<p>Allan did not need to think calmly to know for sure that it would be like this. When the team’s most important two departments had a conflict face-to-face, it was inevitable that it would affect things. If everyone was fighting, perhaps many of the scheduled activities would have to be cancelled.</p>
<p>In order to come to China, he studied the many examples of European teams which came to China to make money these last few years. For example, in the summer of 2005, Real Madrid visited China for the second time. Originally, all the players were scheduled to go on China’s national television to record a program with the Real Madrid fans selected from all over the country. But due to a direct clash between Real Madrid’s commercial and athletics departments, this trip was forced to be canceled because the athletics department strongly objected to the exhausted team participating in the television show. The end result was Real Madrid missed the live recording of the show, leaving a very bad image in the minds of the fans across China.</p>
<p>With Real Madrid’s deep-rooted position in football and vast wealth, they did not take this little effect to heart. But Nottingham Forest, which had just stepped into the Chinese market, could not be careless.</p>
<p>“I’m not an impulsive person. I had thought about it. So, I promised you at that time because I did not want to influence your other plans. But I really couldn’t promise this matter. It offended my bottom line. I don’t know what your thoughts are, Allan. But for someone like me who cares about honor, a matter like this is like asking me to sell out the team. I couldn’t do that, and my players could not agree. You weren’t in the locker room at halftime. Everyone thought we played badly in the first half and they did not want to end the game like that…” He gave a shrug and did not continue to speak.</p>
<p>Allan stood there and did not know what to say.</p>
<p>When he saw that he did not speak, Twain continued, “Allan, you know this team. The whole world probably knows what kind of team Nottingham Forest is. I don’t blame you at all and I did not mean to deliberately go against you. But the Chinese Football Association’s request was too much. I could not accept. It’s their fault. None of us did anything wrong. They didn’t follow the rules of football. So, they had to pay the price and lie in the bed they made. I know better than you do about an organization like the Chinese Football Association. They have become accustomed to manipulating the games and leagues domestically. And now they think they can manipulate us?”</p>
<p>“But Tony. We are going to open a football school in China. This definitely can’t get around the Chinese Football Association. You’re now…” Allan finally had the ability to think, and he spoke harshly.</p>
<p>Twain smiled very happily, “Are you worried that by doing this, I have angered the FA? No, it won’t. Allan. You don’t know enough about this organization. The only person who was enraged by me was the president. Rest assured, his term is ending soon. By the end of this year… it’s not yet known what will happen when the next one comes along. It’s too early to say what’s going to happen.” He winked and added, “The presidents of the Chinese Football Association are transferred from the other institutions to dredge up enough achievements for a few years before they are promoted. They don’t care about how Chinese football is.”</p>
<p>Evan clicked his tongue in astonishment at the side. This kind of thing was really new to him.</p>
<p>Hearing Twain say so, Allan slightly softened his tone. “This is unbelievable.”</p>
<p>“Ha, if you dig deeper into this organization, you’ll find more incredible things. Some things will make you feel like it shouldn’t happen on Earth at all.”</p>
<p>But Allan soon discovered a new problem, “Wait a minute. If they change another leader, does it mean that all my previous efforts have gone to waste?”</p>
<p>“The bigger picture of the agreement negotiated with the organization should not be affected. As long as the relationship is not at an impasse, it will not block the other minor areas for us.” Twain thought about it before saying.</p>
<p>Evan, who had been watching, put his hands together and smiled, “Okay, Allan, this matter has been settled. I did say that Tony must have his thoughts. To tell you the truth, I think the suggestion put forth by the Chinese Football Association is silly, but fortunately Tony did not follow suit.”</p>
<p>Allan feigned anger, “So after all this and it’s my own issue?”</p>
<p>“Ahem…” Evan hurriedly coughed to cover, “This trip to China was perfect, Allan. There were some people who thought the Chinese commercial football games were over, but we have hyped it up this time. I’ve heard that Chelsea is already considering a formal visit to China… These are the best affirmations for you.”</p>
<p>Twain chimed in next to him, “Yes, that’s right. You’re the best I’ve ever seen with this area.”</p>
<p>“You only deal with the managers, Tony.” Allan was not angry. He said to Twain, “Anyway, what you did today made me lose ‘mianzi.’ Yes, ‘mianzi.’”</p>
<p>After spending some time in China, he could understand what “face” meant.</p>
<p>Twain pretended not to understand even though he could, “What’s that?” Noodles?”</p>
<p>“Don’t act silly, Tony.”</p>
<p>“Well, ok, to make up for your ‘mianzi’, I’ve decided to treat you to noodles.” Twain raised his hands in surrender.</p>
<p>“Spaghetti? I’m so sick of it…”</p>
<p>“No, Japanese ramen!”</p>
<p>The second stop of the Nottingham Forest’s East Asia gold rush project was Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 668 - Money Versus No Money</p>
<p>In fact, after the Nottingham Forest team had Beckham, the best money-making place to go was not China, a vast country with a large number of people and seemingly limitless market, but rather a small and narrow country like Japan.</p>
<p>The Japanese’s love and worship of Beckham had already reached the point of no reason. They would crazily pursued anything related to Beckham, and their pursuits were measured by real money. Although China’s market was vast, not many people would really pay for authentic goods due to the impact from the developed piracy industry. There was no such problem in Japan. If they liked Beckham, they would go to a regular store to buy authentic goods. In this way, the economic benefits that Nottingham Forest wanted to see were generated.</p>
<p>Saying this might the Chinese people uncomfortable, but it was indeed like this—Japan was an important money-making destination that many European clubs valued. There was so much money to be made that many people rushed to get there.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s trip to Japan was no different from that in China, with the players as tired as ever. They were only a little more relaxed when they went shopping in Ginza, Tokyo, at night. But to Twain’s delight, there was no such silly organization like the Chinese Football Association here. He did not have to worry about how to play the game.</p>
<p>From their arrival in Tokyo till their departure from Tokyo, Nottingham Forest set off a red Forest craze in Japan for four days. The fans could be seen wearing the red Nottingham Forest jerseys on the streets everywhere.</p>
<p>Evan saw this scene and had to exclaim, “I’m afraid even if Chelsea were here, it would not be able to have that effect.”</p>
<p>“It’s all to David Beckham’s credit.” Allan was aware who the key figure was. He said, “His influence in Japan can only be described as ‘frightening.’”</p>
<p>Allan was right. In Tokyo, Japan, wherever Beckham appeared, the traffic would be jammed. Giant billboards with his head shots were erected at the top of tall buildings, and the goods associated with him were certain to be popular. Businesses did not need to advertise at all. The name “Beckham” was the best publicity.</p>
<p>In China, George Wood’s popularity could still match Beckham’s. However, even if the entire Nottingham Forest team combined, they were still not as popular as Beckham in Japan. Allan was well aware of this, so it was Beckham’s one-man show most of the time in Japan, while Nottingham Forest served as his background.</p>
<p>Here, Tony Twain had become a completely unknown staff member.</p>
<p>Twain would take this situation and joked with George Wood, “Go back and complain to your agent. He has made too little effort in Japan. Look at David!”</p>
<p>George Wood declined to comment on Twain’s joke.</p>
<p>On the last night, Nottingham Forest played against the local J1 League team, FC Tokyo at the Tokyo National Stadium. With two sets of lineups deployed, Nottingham Forest scored two goals in the first and second halves respectively to win 4:1 against FC Tokyo, which was currently ranked eighth in the J1 League.</p>
<p>After the game, the players did not get a good night’s sleep back at the hotel. They had to rush to Narita International Airport to fly directly to Hong Kong that night. Time was so tight that even an extra night of rest could not be squeezed out. They could only nap on the flight to make up for it.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest was also warmly welcomed upon arrival in Hong Kong. As it was once a British colony, the English Premier League had a very solid base of masses in Hong Kong. Influenced by Hong Kong, the whole of Guangdong was also a loyal fan base of the Premier League. So, when Nottingham Forest was in Ningbo, the Guangdong fans who could not get there due to the distance, flocked to Hong Kong this time to catch a glimpse of the Double Winner.</p>
<p>For three days, not only did they play, Nottingham Forest also had a party with the stars of Hong Kong’s entertainment industry. The stars whom Twain could only previously see on the television were now Beckham’s or Forest fans. This sense of accomplishment made him feel very good.</p>
<p>At that party, he even played a prank on Andy Lau as he held his hand and said, “I like to listen to your songs. I can even sing Forget Love Potion!”</p>
<p>Then he laughed happily inside as he looked at Andy Lau’s intermingled stunned look and happy expression.</p>
<p>At the end of the party, the Hong Kong stars wore Nottingham Forest’s red jerseys and posed for photos with the players. This event not only appeared in the sports media but was also widely watched by the entertainment media. Allan Adams’ global outreach program was perfectly executed here in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Nottingham Forest team was known to anyone who loved football or did not care about it at all overnight in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A game was certainly not forgotten. Nottingham Forest and Hong Kong Football Club played a friendly match in Hong Kong. Two sets of lineups were deployed to satisfy the audience and also to allow as many players as possible to get the opportunity to exercise. The only regret was that the Forest team’s performance in this game was clearly not as good as the first two games. The main lineup looked a little tired and out of form. The two sides ended up with a 3:3 draw, which the media promoted as a happy result.</p>
<p>But was that true?</p>
<p>On the flight to Thailand, Twain’s eyebrows were knitted. The adverse effects of commercial competitions and frequent commercial activities finally emerged. The fitness of the players had reached its limits. Whatever the parties on the Thailand and Malaysia sides had in mind, he had made up his mind to play the next two games with the reserves team and substitutes. His own players must be fully rested. Originally this year, the team’s training time was reduced due to UEFA European Championship. However, they had to travel to East Asia to make money now and the whole team together did not have a systematic physical training. Their performance simply maintained from last season, which was just a continued state. At the end of the day, the Nottingham Forest team’s condition continued from last season and were not in the new season yet.</p>
<p>This worried him a little.</p>
<p>The history and lessons of the predecessors told himself that such commercial games would inevitably affect the team’s performance in the new season. How could he minimize this effect? Twain had a severe headache.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest was still warmly sought after in Southeast Asia, but there was less commercial activity here and the team could finally train systematically. But the whole summer had been disrupted by the European Championship, commercial games and Olympic Games. What was the use of this small amount of systematic training?</p>
<p>After their narrow victories against the local teams in Thailand and Malaysia, the team finally got on a flight back to the United Kingdom, ending a busy and arduous trip to Asia.</p>
<p>It was busy and hard for the team. But for Allan Adams, it was a very productive summer. Just from five games alone, the Forest team’s income was five million euros, an average of one million euros per game. One must know that when Real Madrid started a new wave of commercial competition spree in Asia since 2003, the appearance fee per game was two million euros. In addition to the “hidden income” from those direct income plus the free accommodation and food transportation provided by the organizers, Nottingham Forest made thirteen million euros in one summer. These thirteen million euros did not include a package of commercial partnerships that, if successful, were expected to generate at least thirty million euros for the Nottingham Forest Football Club over the next six years.</p>
<p>There were also some very long-term investments, such as the proposed construction of a Nottingham Forest football training base in Ningbo, dedicated to recruiting young players from China and nearby countries. The school would use the training materials, standards and programs of the English Professional Football Club to discover and nurture Asian talent. Like the University of Nottingham in Ningbo, the school was completely independent of the Chinese football environment and was closely linked to Nottingham Forest, sharing all the resources of Nottingham Forest. The outstanding young players would have the opportunity to go straight to England for more advanced training and were likely to sign with the Forest team. Then they would be on loan to train in the Forest team’s satellite clubs which certainly included the Chinese clubs.</p>
<p>Ningbo was chosen because of the strong support from the Ningbo municipal government. The city government’s leadership wanted to get rid of the long-standing image of Ningbo as an “economically strong but a weak football city”, so they hit it off with Allan Adams. Building a school here, Nottingham Forest could enjoy a number of preferential policies.</p>
<p>In addition to the new football school, Nottingham Forest planned to try to enter the property sector through building a new stadium in Nottingham. Allan saw China’s vast real estate market and decided to invest in China by starting a real estate company which was sole responsible for investing in the real estate business here.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s licensing rights was also signed after a consultation with Nike. The Wenzhou-based factory had started producing a variety of souvenirs, jerseys, backpacks, scarves, water glasses, lighters, key chains, cup holders, cutlery, tents… Covering almost every aspect of life. The first specialty store would open for business in Shanghai and the second branch would open in Beijing after April. The goods sold here would be much cheaper than the other teams’ souvenir franchises. The Chinese fans did not need to spend half a month’s salary to buy an authentic jersey. Those small items were cheaper and well-made. Even those people who were not Forest fans, could also purchase and used them at home as they were also very practical and looked good. They could also be used as gifts for friends who were fans.</p>
<p>Not only that, Allan Adams was ambitious. The plan he gave Evan Doughty was not as simple as selling a few commemorative items. He wanted to sell more than just the Nottingham Forest brand. He wanted to sell a way of life and culture. From the most authentic English pub, the most quintessential English style, the most laid-back English country atmosphere, to the noble and elegant authentic English afternoon tea, he wanted the name of Nottingham Forest to appear in the lives of any ordinary Chinese.</p>
<p>This was all that he planned, and it sounded incredible. But maybe this was one of the factors of Allan Adams’s success. He always dared to come up with things that ordinary people dared not think of. No European professional football club had ever wanted to develop the Chinese and Asian markets like this…</p>
<p>“The Nottingham Forest team is not the sum of my business plan. It’s just a knock on the door and a key. After opening the door to this market, we can develop in whichever way we want. The team will not need to play in such an important role. In my view, this market is simply a virgin land without any trace of development. There are countless possibilities. It’s simply fantastic…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>If anyone thought that in two and a half weeks in Asia, besides training the team, Twain’s days were spent participating in commercial activities everywhere and allowing people to take photos with him like a lifelike wax figurine, he would be wrong.</p>
<p>Even in as far afield as Asia, Twain was still keeping an eye on every move in the transfer market. Two players had left the Forest team so far in the new season, but no one had been signed yet. This was clearly not in line with Twain’s plans at the end of last season.</p>
<p>Although Kompany was training to a part-time defensive midfielder, Twain could not guarantee the result since he switched to a position he was not trained for. Therefore, there was still a need to keep looking for George Wood’s replacement—not as a substitute, but the replacement. After he met with several rebuffs in a row, he was interested in Tiago Mendes who was unhappy at Juventus.</p>
<p>Tiago moved to Chelsea from the Portuguese team, Benfica in 2004 and became part of Mourinho’s “Portuguese gang.” He won the Premier League title as a Chelsea player in the 04-05 season. But after only one season, he had to clear his position for Essien’s arrival. He transferred to Lyon in the summer of 2005 for a fee of 6.5 million pounds and helped Lyon win two France Ligue 1 titles in the following two seasons. He then transferred to Serie A’s Juventus.</p>
<p>Judging from this achievement, his career had been brilliant. But his experience at Juventus was a failure. Juventus spent and brought in Tiago for thirteen million euros, making him the chief transfer target for Juventus that summer. But just four months later, the Italian media gave him the title of “the top failed transfer of the season.” Ranieri who was originally bullish on him, also gave him a death sentence.</p>
<p>It was not that Tiago’s strength was not good. It was that he could not adapt to the pace of the Serie A competition and Ranieri’s tactics.</p>
<p>Tiago was an excellent defensive midfielder, but he was better suited to play his part in the triangular pass in the 4-3-3 formation, which meant he should play as a defensive midfielder alone rather than as a center forward parallel in the 4-4-2 formation, as Ranieri did. This could only make him lose his way and lose his position.</p>
<p>Tiago himself said that he always tried to intercept the ball during the games and then handed the football to his teammates. A defensive midfielder’s position leaning to the back was more suitable for him.</p>
<p>Ranieri certainly would not change his overall tactics and formation for Tiago alone. But Tiago’s characteristic was well suited to Twain’s requirements.</p>
<p>In January, there was news of Tiago’s desire for a transfer, but it never came to fruition. Tiago was reluctant to move to a second-tier league. The only option before him now seemed to be to return to Portugal, to Benfica or Porto, so he would be at the heart of European football…and Nottingham Forest came forward in time to save his career.</p>
<p>While Tony Twain’s team was still having a good time in Hong Kong, the people from the Forest team was already in contact with Tiago’s agent. Would Tiago have any objections to joining the UEFA Champions League and Premier League champions? The only problem was that Tiago knew George Wood. He was afraid that he would only sit on the bench with George Wood around. Twain immediately called to personally assure him that in the new season, the Forest team would carry out a large-scale rotation. George Wood was definitely not the immoveable main force in this position. As the Forest team would play more games and the summer preparations were not finished yet, the players’ fitness would certainly not be as vigorous as they were in the previous two seasons.</p>
<p>The manager’s personal assurance dispelled the one last doubt in Tiago’s mind, and he agreed to join Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Juventus could not wait to get rid of this useless baggage. With this link, Nottingham Forest could beat down the transfer price. After several rounds of negotiations, Tiago, whom Juventus had originally spent thirteen million euros on, eventually joined Nottingham Forest for six million euros and became the first player to join the Forest team this summer.</p>
<p>In this regard, the player who could jointly serve as the defensive midfielder as George Wood, had been finalized. Kompany certainly would not suspend his training as a defensive midfielder. Every player must know that it was ideal to be able to adapt to multiple positions at the same time to have enough opportunities to play at Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>This season, Evan had given Twain a transfer budget of thirty million euros and asked him to save as much as possible, with the best result being there would be money left from the twenty-five million euros. A portion of the revenue from the sale of the players would be added to the transfer budget, while the other portion would go directly into the club’s accounts.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest had now sold Grosso and Sidwell for 15.2 million euros. Adding five million to the transfer budget, six million had been used out of the thirty-five million, and twenty-nine million euros were left. Twain also needed to go after at least one attacking midfielder and two defenders in the transfer market. This amount of money would not accomplish much, so he had to give up the talented players who had been snapped up by the powerhouse teams or the long-time star players and instead poached those “low-profile players” who appeared unknown but had good abilities.</p>
<p>It was tough to be poor. When could Tony Twain realize his dream of snapping up players all over the world by brandishing a checkbook?</p>
<p>When we have the money, we will buy four Kakas! One for the game, one on the bench, one in the stands, one in the stands, and one on loan to a Premier League team to exercise!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 669 - A Former Genius’s New Life</p>
<p>For a mid to lower level team or a team that simply aimed to make it to the European arena next season, the transfer budget of twenty-nine million euros was not considered low. But for a team that aspired to defend multiple titles and aimed to make a historic breakthrough in the English FA Cup, twenty-nine million might just be enough to buy one player.</p>
<p>Twain must plan meticulously and calculate carefully. The day when he could sign a check as long as he liked it was destined to be a dream.</p>
<p>Perhaps this had to do with Twain being a Chinese man. He was not particularly extravagant when it came to the transfer fees. It was evidenced by the fact that the transfer budget given by the team last summer had not run out and the club made money from the sale of Anelka and Ashley Young.</p>
<p>As long as he carefully planned and determined his targets, with some good luck, it was not impossible to buy good and cheap players with twenty-nine million.</p>
<p>In fact, most positions in the Forest team had at least one dedicated substitute player. Only one position had always been one player supporting it. This position was not the defensive midfielder which people thought, but the defensive midfielder’s partner, the attacking midfielder.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart was the absolute playmaker of the team. He was better at organizing the offense than Ribéry, and he was also capable in long shots and positional play to score goals. But van der Vaart was not an iron man like George Wood after all. Although he did not suffer any major injuries after he transferred to Nottingham Forest, he still occasionally had minor injuries, which was a worry. Generally, if he could not play, Twain would let Ribéry guest played as the attacking midfielder. But this was not a long-term solution. In the previous world that Twain knew, van der Vaart frequently had injuries. It could be said that Twain was lucky that he did not have any major injuries here. The other reason as that George Wood helped share some of the pressure with him.</p>
<p>In any case, a dedicated midfielder in the middle was needed to rotate with van der Vaart. Even without injury, van der Vaart’s fitness did not guarantee that he would be able to play a full season.</p>
<p>After George Wood’s rotation partner was settled, Twain started to fret about van der Vaart’s replacement.</p>
<p>There was no shortage of good and well-known attacking midfielders in the world, such as Brazil’s Kaka, who was currently the world’s number one attacking midfielder, and Ronaldinho, who was eliminated by Barcelona. Kaka was the type of player Twain longed for. However, Nottingham Forest was not likely to get the Brazilian crown jewel, either in terms of the team’s appeal or financial ability. As for Ronaldinho… Twain did not like this kind of disorganized and undisciplined player. He did not want him even if he had the talent.</p>
<p>Basically, Twain could set his target on those players who were marginally famous, but not a world-class star player yet with a relatively simple life off-field and would not require high salaries… And there was another important point in that if the player’s owner did not want this guy, it was even better.</p>
<p>But where could he find such a good deal?</p>
<p>During the UEFA European Championship, Twain became interested in the Croatian midfielder, Luka Modrić. But Dinamo Zagreb Lions demanded an exorbitant price and wanted at least twenty million euros to let him go. While Modrić himself was keen to join the UEFA Champions League winner, Nottingham Forest, Twain was not willing to come up with two-thirds of his transfer budget to rotate the attacking midfielder position. The Forest Team could only abandon plans to bring in Modrić and find a new target.</p>
<p>Modrić himself eventually achieved his goal of landing in the top league in Europe—he joined Tottenham Hotspur for a transfer fee of up to 16.6 million pounds, or 20.88 million euros.</p>
<p>The real billionaires in the Premier League this summer were not Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool or Chelsea, but the mid-stream team, Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
<p>While he could only envy the other people for having the money to spend, Twain continued to search for the targets he admired in the transfer market.</p>
<p>Deco, who had the strength and reputation, was cheap due to Barcelona’s initiative to clean house. But he did not want to come to the Forest team. He chose Chelsea, coached by his national team manager. As a result of this relationship, Chelsea only spent eight million pounds.</p>
<p>Nasri was also a young attacking midfielder whom Twain was interested in. He was known in the French media as “the second Zidane.” But his price was not cheap, and Nasri himself wanted to join Arsenal, coached by the French professor, Arsène Wenger. In the end, Arsenal paid twelve million pounds to bring him to the Emirates Stadium.</p>
<p>Dos Santos was also good, showing enough ability in the Barcelona First Team but he lacked the opportunity and experience. Nottingham Forest began an intense contest against Tottenham Hotspur for him. Eventually, dos Santos’s personal will played a key role. He believed that life at Nottingham Forest would be no different from life at Barcelona, while Tottenham Hotspur promised him the main position. In this way, Tottenham Hotspur bought dos Santos, known as the “Mexican Ronaldinho” for seven million pounds.</p>
<p>Twain was left angry with the series of setbacks suffered in the transfer market. Time was running out every day. As August was drawing closer and closer, the new season was about to begin, and the team had not made any progress in the transfer market. Some media had already taunted that even though Nottingham Forest had won the UEFA Champions League and Premier League titles, its appeal had declined instead. Such a comical thing could only happen with Tony Twain’s team.</p>
<p>Therefore, he prayed to God every day before going to bed at night, hoping to wake up the next day to find an attacking midfielder in an intoxicated state sleeping next to him.</p>
<p>Although such a nonsensical event was unlikely to happen, Twain finally found a candidate for the attacking midfielder position, who met the current constraints and had the ability and potential recognized by Twain.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the 04-05 season, a young talent with dual German and Turkish citizenship made his mark in the Bundesliga. It might be an exaggeration to use a bolt from the blue, but he was indeed a talented teenager from Turkish football.</p>
<p>He made his debut in Dortmund’s game against VfL Wolfsburg at the time and played the entire time. This Turkish teenager who was not even seventeen at that time, became the youngest player to make an appearance in Bundesliga history. Following which, it did not take him long to become the youngest goalscorer in Bundesliga history and also became one of the world’s top hundred hopeful stars.</p>
<p>But his fame at a young age left him prematurely burdened. On top of that, Dortmund was in deep financial trouble and there were chaos within the team. Consequently, he also sunk into obscurity.</p>
<p>Just last season, Dortmund, which had too many midfielders, loaned him out to the Eredivisie strong team, Feyenoord in the hope that he would get plenty of practice. Coincidentally, Feyenoord’s manager was his mentor, van Marwijk at Dortmund in the first place.</p>
<p>Initially, he could have received a very good training in the Netherlands in this way, which was the only way for a rising midfield star. Van Marwijk was very bullish on the future of the disciple whom he was proud of originally.</p>
<p>His debut in the Netherlands was a great success. He scored a goal in his first game and had an assist.</p>
<p>But bad luck soon descended. In the third game which he played for Feyenoord; he was viciously attacked by his opponent. He fell to the ground and could not get up. He was taken away by an ambulance from the stadium at that time. His face was covered with tears when he left the field, because only he knew how serious the injury was. At the time, he felt he had completely lost the use of his left leg and had no sensation in it at all.</p>
<p>The results from the hospital check-up made everyone gasped.</p>
<p>His left knee cartilage was crushed and suffered a fracture. His meniscus was torn, and cruciate ligament was lacerated.</p>
<p>Any one of those injuries alone was a major enemy of a footballer’s career. And now what did it mean to have all three concentrated on the player’s left knee?</p>
<p>Feyenoord later announced that he would miss all the remaining games of the season, and the chief surgeon for the operation said in an interview after the surgery that he was not sure if this Turkish talent would be able to return to the field because…even normal walking might be affected.</p>
<p>At the time, in addition to condemning the culprits, the Dutch, Turkish and German media, bemoaned that “the premature fall of a very talented player!”</p>
<p>Did this statement sound sensational? But it was a true reflection of his situation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this strong Turkish youngster did not give up his football dream and actively cooperated with the rehabilitation to successfully returned to the field at the end of the season. At the time, the Dutch media exclaimed that he had created a sports medicine miracle.</p>
<p>But when he returned to the field, his performance could not be compared to before his injury. The shadow of the serious injury lingered in his heart and he simply dared not do some movements. He appeared to be afraid of the slightest thing on the field. The media’s assessment of him was that it was “as if he had lost his original spirit overnight.”</p>
<p>It was a fitting metaphor. That player who had set a number of records, led Turkey to win the 2005 UEFA European Under-17 Championship title and was the youngest goalscorer in the history of the Turkey national team, had now become completely ordinary.</p>
<p>This was a fact that made Dortmund and Turkey extremely sad, but they had to accept the reality. Having been badly wounded, he was far from how he was in many ways.</p>
<p>Van Marwijk was also sorry. He had initially hoped to develop him into a world-famous star player, and now it was all over.</p>
<p>At the end of the season, he returned to Dortmund. If he had not been injured, his future would have been bright. He was only nineteen years old and had plenty of time to create a future that belonged to him. But now, Dortmund did not have a place for him. He had lost his talent and physique. He did not know where his future laid.</p>
<p>This once-talented teenager’s family was poor. His father was a Turkish laborer in Germany and his mother was a housewife. The family of three lived in a small village in Dortmund with more than thirty relatives. If he had not been injured and become the core of Dortmund’s squad as he wished, then the family’s financial difficulties were nothing. He could get a lucrative contract, buy a house in Dortmund, have a car and live like a rich man.</p>
<p>But now, it was all over.</p>
<p>Dortmund intended to offer him a contract, but it was a far cry from the original one they had promised. After all, the treatment for a substitute player could not be the same as it was for the core of the main force and the hopeful star player.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to bow to his fate and sign this contract with Dortmund, someone knocked on his house door.</p>
<p>“We want Nuri Şahin. Let’s give a price.” The man from Nottingham Forest said to Dortmund.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“You must be crazy, Tony. This Turkish boy is not worth buying at all. You can’t just give vent like that just because you are unable to buy your targets in the transfer market, can you?” Kerslake was shocked to learn that Twain was going to bring in the Turkish kid, who had just been forced to retire. His mouth was opened so wide that a hard-boiled egg could be stuffed directly into it.</p>
<p>“You’re like a woman who has lost her head from anger!”</p>
<p>“It hurts me so much that you would say that, David.” Twain covered his heart and explained, “I know he was badly hurt. But I think the fact that he’s not doing as well as he used to be, is not due to his body, but because of his psychological state. Unfortunately, neither Feyenoord nor Dortmund care about this. They habitually believe that the biggest cause of this situation and the most fundamental reason is the regression of his physical function.”</p>
<p>“Psychological state?”</p>
<p>“In reality, his mental qualities are still very good. Otherwise he would have to announce his retirement right after the injury. Because that kind of serious injury was not something a nineteen-year-old kid can take on alone. It is only at such times that he needs others’ guidance more. By saying so, it may not be fair to Şahin. But I do think his injury is a good opportunity for us. When Arsenal bought Rosický two years ago, they planned to bid three million euros to take Şahin away. But Dortmund was adamant not to let go. They wanted to develop Şahin as the new core of Westfalenstadion. If he had not been injured, we would not even have a chance to sit down with Dortmund and talk about the price. Now the other side has happily agree to our offer…”</p>
<p>“Of course, they can’t wait to get rid of a burden.”</p>
<p>“Actually, this matter with Şahin reminds me of another thing … I think our club should hire a few psychologists to come on board.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Kerslake seemed like he was listening to a fantasy story.</p>
<p>“Frequent injuries and sitting on the bench long-term can lead to depression, ups and downs in the form, the strikers missing goals, the goalkeepers dropping goals in succession, the minutiae in life affecting the performance on the field … None of these can be solved by training. Our players need psychologists to comfort them, guide them and keep them happy and healthy mentally.” Twain stroked his chin and nodded, “I think it’s necessary and pressing. I’m going to talk to Mr. Chairman now.”</p>
<p>With that, he got up.</p>
<p>“Hey, Tony. About that Turkish kid…” Kerslake stopped him.</p>
<p>“Any other issues? Dortmund has agreed to our two million euro offer. All that’s left is to sign the individual contract with him.” Twain looked back at his assistant manager and said, “Ah, I forgot to say just now another reason why his injury was good for us. We can take the opportunity to lower his package… Of course, it will be more than what he would get at Dortmund, but it can only be ranked in the lower tier within the team. He himself can’t get a better deal than with us and now he’s been given a chance to play for the European champion. He should thank us. Buying someone like that is better than buying someone like Ronaldinho to balance our weekly salary budget.”</p>
<p>Having said that, Twain went out to talk to Evan in detail about his suggestion to hire a psychologist.</p>
<p>Kerslake and Dunn were left in the office. Kerslake turned to look at Dunn and said, “Dunn, you’re neighbors with him. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“In terms of the players and team, this is the best solution.” Dunn replied expressionlessly.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Two days later, Nottingham Forest and Dortmund announced at the same time that the nineteen-year-old Turkish young player had moved from Westfalenstadion to the City Ground stadium for a fee of two million euros.</p>
<p>As soon as this news came out, the English media blew it up. The introduction of Şahin by the Forest team two years ago would have been widely praised, but now endless taunts and sneers were directed at Tony Twain.</p>
<p>Everyone knew what happened to this Turkish kid last season. To be honest, his once-bright future needed not be mentioned but now very few people in the world would believe that he could get back to his pre-injury level. Maybe the Turkish national coach Terim was one and Tony Twain was the second.</p>
<p>[Two million euros to buy a child who’s almost retired?]</p>
<p>[Tony Twain always amuses us]</p>
<p>[Only a fool believes that Şahin can recover]</p>
<p>“I don’t understand at all Tony Twain’s move in the transfer market … First, Tiago, the sub-par import whom Juventus doesn’t want, then Şahin, who broke his leg in the Netherlands. A Double Winner of the Champions League and Premier League acts as if it’s picking up the scraps…”</p>
<p>“I can personally guarantee that Nuri Şahin will be the most disastrous acquisition in Tony Twain’s tenure!”</p>
<p>“Tony Twain had used his actions to tell us that this world is full of extraordinary things.”</p>
<p>For the English media, which liked to nitpick and make cutting remarks the most, it was delightful for them to be able to find an opportunity to mock Twain. Certainly, their suspicions about Şahin’s ability were not related to Twain. The sarcasm might have been motivated by a private grievance, but Şahin’s ability was indeed not recognized by these people at all.</p>
<p>“…He had suffered such a serious injury in the Eredivisie. Don’t tell me that the defenders in the English leagues would be nice gentlemen? I really don’t know what Tony Twain is thinking. Maybe his brain structure is different from us ordinary people?”</p>
<p>Words like these flew everywhere. Everyone criticized and questioned Twain’s transfer decision. Some people even questioned whether he received any kickbacks. Twain could not be bothered to quarrel with them, and he thought these flies actually gave him a big help.</p>
<p>When Şahin came to Nottingham, Twain welcomed the unhappy Turkish “former” genius with a pile of newspapers that admonished the two of them.</p>
<p>“Do you understand English?” Twain asked through the interpreter.</p>
<p>“Just a little…”Şahin spoke softly as he was first new to the environment and the confusion about the future made his mood very low.</p>
<p>Seeing him like this, Twain was more convinced that Şahin’s problem was psychological. He smiled and handed the newspapers to Şahin. Then he informed him through the interpreter, “All the newspapers are scolding me and saying that I spent two million dollars on someone who couldn’t play football at all. Ah, they also questioned your ability by the way.”</p>
<p>The interpreter stared at Twain, wondering why he made these remarks. Twain just glanced at him and let him translate as it was.</p>
<p>By this time, Şahin had already turned his attention to the brightly colored newspapers. His photographs appeared in the sports headlines. They were mostly photographs from during his injury in the Netherlands. Without knowing much English, he knew nothing good was written just by looking at these pictures. Consequently, he was even more depressed.</p>
<p>After hearing the translation, he looked up strangely at Twain.</p>
<p>This man laughed instead and completely ignored the media’s rebuke. “You may not understand now, but when you stay in this team a little longer and when your English level has improved, you’ll know—me.” He said, pointing to himself and then the newspapers. “My reputation here is not good. It’s better to use ‘infamous’ to describe. Now that I insist on bringing you to Nottingham Forest, this gives them a reason to attack me. But I don’t care. They can scold all they want. I’ll just do my bit. And I’m not like those idiots. I believe you have a bright future ahead of you!”</p>
<p>Since his injury, all Şahin had heard had been laments and everyone bemoaned the injustice of fate, which led to the death of a genius who could have become a star but was now a shooting star. He no longer wanted to listen to such morale-busting words. He did not expect that the manager of this team would say to him “I believe you have a bright future ahead of you!” when he got to Nottingham.</p>
<p>Looking up at this man’s smile, he suddenly felt that he might have been lucky to leave Dortmund.</p>
<p>“Now all of England is not optimistic about your new life. Do you want to give them a good show in the near future? Let them know how outrageously wrong they are?” Twain winked at Şahin. His hoarse voice seemed to contain a magical power, and Şahin could not help but nod after listening.</p>
<p>Twain laughed and patted him hard on the back, “Then drum up your fighting spirit! Don’t look so sad. I promise you that when you give them a good slap, you’ll feel damn good. Haha!”</p>
<p>The next day, at a press conference, Şahin showed off his skills in front of hundreds of Forest fans and dozens of media reporters. Twain watched him perform with a smile on his face, just as he did before he was injured. He showed his creative flair and skill as a midfield playmaker in the seldom seen bright sunshine.</p>
<p>Then he raised the red Nottingham Forest jersey with his name and number on it along with Twain.</p>
<p>Number 16 was his number in the new team.</p>
<p>A whole new life began just like the new number.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 670: Goodbye, Gerard</p>
<p>Şahin displayed his skills in a meeting with the fans and media, showing that his injuries did not really defeat his body. But the voices of doubt about him still lingered. Fortunately, he came to England and did not understand English. There were less worries since he could not read or hear how the media evaluate him. Furthermore, Twain told him that, as a professional player, the best way to counter doubts was not to argue with the other parties in the media, but to use his performance on the field to give them a slap on the face.</p>
<p>At the same time, Twain’s suggestion to Evan about the psychiatrists was also in place. Four female physicians, from young to old, had a wealth of clinical experience in mental therapy at the football clubs. Their first “patient” was the former Turkish genius, Nuri Şahin.</p>
<p>Dunn teased Twain, “You don’t really need to hire them. You are the best psychiatrist for these players.”</p>
<p>Twain made a face and said, “I’m not the key to everything. I can’t do every job.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Barcelona’s newly appointed manager, Guardiola, stood on the sidelines of the grassy training ground and was being interviewed on a television station. He talked a lot about the outlook for the new season and was now talking about the transformation of the rear defensive line. He said, “Gabriel is adapting and doing a good job. I don’t think it’s a good idea for Carles (Puyol) to always play as the center back… I know where Barcelona’s weakness in the rear is and we need a center back who is outstanding at headers, tall, strong, great at jumping to make up for this weak spot…”</p>
<p>“It is rumored that Barcelona has contacted with Nottingham Forest’s Piqué. Is this true?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to deceive you. The truth is that our people have made an offer to Nottingham Forest. But so far we have not received a response.” Guardiola shook his head.</p>
<p>They certainly had not received a response from Nottingham Forest because Nottingham Forest is struggling internally with this offer.</p>
<p>Barcelona had made a bid of ten million pounds for Piqué. This price was not low for a center back. The crux was Twain did not want to let Piqué go. For three seasons, his partnership with Pepe had long been the main stay at Nottingham Forest. Both of them were tall, excellent at aerial defense and physically strong. They played expertly in the Premier League which paid particular attention to physical strength. With his outstanding performance at the Forest team, Piqué was also selected for the Spain national team and also won the UEFA European Championship with the team this summer. As a player, he had already won the Premier League, the Champions League and the UEFA European Championship titles at the age of twenty-one.</p>
<p>What Twain was afraid of now was that he did not have any extravagant demands. Because that meant the reason he was best at using to appeal to people now lacked persuasion.</p>
<p>He held the Barcelona’s offer for two days, and Piqué finally found him today.</p>
<p>“Boss, can I talk to you after the training?” In between practices, he walked up to Twain on the sidelines of the training ground and said in a low voice.</p>
<p>Twain, who was discussing plans for the new season with the other coaches, glanced at everyone. Then he turned to Piqué and said with a smile, “That’s strange. You never ask to speak to me on your own.”</p>
<p>Piqué was a little embarrassed. He scratched his head and said, “It’s good to have the first time, then there will be a second time…”</p>
<p>Twain laughed when he heard him say so. But he said nothing, and just nodded his head.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the same time, in another crowd of people.</p>
<p>“I bet that guy, Gerard wants to leave.” The man who said this was the other center back, Pepe.</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. What surprised them was not the fact that Piqué wanted to leave, but that this remark was uttered by his center back partner. They should have a good relationship with each other. Should he not express some unwillingness in his partner’s departure?</p>
<p>Pepe found everyone looking at him and knew what these people thought. His straightforward face smiled, “What? I’m not the one who’s going to let him go.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any reason to go. It’s good here. Why does he have to go?” As a member of the rear defensive line, Bale naturally hoped that everyone would still be together next season. Stability was the first requirement of the rear defensive line.</p>
<p>“Little monkey, he came from Barcelona, and now Barcelona beckons him. Do you think he can resist?” Pepe was very clear-eyed about this.</p>
<p>“I still can’t understand…” Bale muttered.</p>
<p>“Some people are crazy about money…” At this, Pepe glanced at Ribéry, sitting outside the crowd, “Some people care more about fame; some people are loyal; and some people dream of playing for their hometown teams…It’s all quite normal.” With these words everyone regarded Pepe differently, as if he were a profound philosopher.</p>
<p>“If he must leave, no one can stop him. I think the boss knows this too…”</p>
<p>Pepe stopped talking because Piqué had ended his conversation with Twain and was walking this way.</p>
<p>Sitting outside, Ribéry looked at Piqué walking over and fell into a contemplation.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Seeing Piqué go, the coaches came over again.</p>
<p>“It must be because of Barcelona, right?” Someone asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely.” Twain shrugged. “We beat them twice on the field and now they’ve got a chance to get one back at us…”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Piqué’s back and did not know what to say for a while.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After the training, everyone showered in the locker room and went home. Piqué knocked on the door of Twain’s office.</p>
<p>Twain sat alone in front of the computer and played Minesweeper out of boredom. When he saw Piqué opened the door and walked in, he stood up and shut down the Minesweeper game.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re here to talk to me about.” Although he stood up, he did not step out to greet him. He just pointed to the couch next to him and motioned for Piqué to sit with him.</p>
<p>“The matter with Barcelona is probably…” He meant to say, “troubling you.” But he felt it sounded wrong when the words were about to come out of his mouth. The matter was not so simple because Twain had no idea whether this “troubled” Piqué. So, he coughed, “What do you think?”</p>
<p>“I…” Piqué was quiet for a moment and finally made up his mind. He lifted his head and said, “I don’t want to lie to you, boss. Barça’s invitation is very attractive for me.”</p>
<p>“Bigger than staying at Nottingham Forest to continue winning the championship titles?” Twain asked in return.</p>
<p>Piqué was silent again. He knew what the temperament of the manager of this team. It was not okay to lie. If he were to tell the truth… he did not know if the boss would be angrier?</p>
<p>In the end, he decided to tell the truth. After all, the boss might get angry if he told the truth but if he lied to him, the boss would definitely be angry—as to why he knew Piqué was telling a lie, it was because the media had already disclosed the truth… Damn the media!</p>
<p>“Honestly, boss. It’s hard for me to turn down Barcelona’s invitation.”</p>
<p>Twain nodded. That was what the media said. Piqué still had a lot of affection for Barcelona. After he made his name at the Forest team in the first place, Real Madrid spread the news that they wanted to buy him. At that time, he expressed his loyalty to the team. He said, “I’m not leaving Nottingham Forest. I’m doing well here.” Finally, when the media relentlessly asked him hypothetical questions, he said, “If I have to go, I will only go back to Barcelona.”</p>
<p>Those words came true today.</p>
<p>“Go on.” When Piqué became quiet after he said this, Twain could only indicate for him to go on. He said, “Tell me all your thoughts, I’m not an unreasonable person.”</p>
<p>Therefore, Piqué spoke his mind. The general idea was that he was cultivated by La Masia even though Barcelona did not give him a chance at that time. Hence he was forced to leave for England. But his heart would always belong to Catalonia. As long as Barcelona needed him, he would toss everything aside to step across all trials and tribulations and not be afraid of any difficulty to risk everything to help out—well, though he did not say that, Twain felt that this was what he meant—Moreover, he had already obtained his personal honors. He was still young and wanted to meet new challenges in Barcelona. In addition, the familial pressure was also great. His relatives were loyal Barcelona fans. His maternal grandfather was once the vice-president of the Barcelona Football Club. How could they not be loyal? His entire family wanted Piqué back in his hometown.</p>
<p>“So, in other words… Your dream is to play for Barcelona and play there until you retire?” Twain asked.</p>
<p>“If possible, yes, it looks that way.”</p>
<p>Twain sighed, “So, that means I have helped Barcelona develop a good center back and solve the problems in their defensive line at a critical moment?”</p>
<p>Piqué did not know what to say. He felt that the boss was angry.</p>
<p>Twain was certainly angry. This was a player whom he developed after much efforts. With one sentence of “need to strengthen our defense” from his former owner, this hopeful star player immediately “answered their summon” … He would not be normal if he was not a little angry. He was not so generous that he could wave and said, “Piqué, my brother, please feel free to go pursue your dream.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to go, Gerard. You’re very important in our team. You play well with Pepe in your partnership. Do you know what defense means to me?”</p>
<p>“Championship title, boss.” Piqué’s reaction was quick.</p>
<p>“So, I hope you can stay here.” Twain sat in the boss’s chair with both hands covering his lower abdomen as he crossed his legs.</p>
<p>Piqué was silent for a moment and then shook his head, “Boss, this is hard.”</p>
<p>Twain did not rail at him. Instead, Twain just looked at him wordlessly.</p>
<p>In fact, Twain knew in his heart that he could not make Piqué stay. Piqué and Ribéry were completely different. Ribéry was purely about the money. It was easy to achieve this goal. While what Piqué pursued was ten million times more illusory than money—loyalty. It was not loyalty to Nottingham Forest, but loyalty to Barcelona.</p>
<p>He graduated from La Masia, trained in La Masia from an early age, and his family members were Barcelona’s most loyal fans for generations. He had received this education since he was aware: Barcelona was the best club in the world. Barcelona was the only team he loved and followed. It was a great honor to play for such a great team. Even if he did not win a championship title, there would be no complaints. Even if Barcelona was relegated one day and on the verge of bankruptcy, he would not change his love for this team…</p>
<p>This was what gave Twain the biggest headache. He could still use the carrot and stick to deal with Ribéry, increased his salary, and inspired him with a sense of honor and loyalty. These were totally useless to deal with Piqué. His loyalty was dedicated to Barcelona, for which he could even accept a reduction in his annual salary. If this was a different situation, people might say he was doing something demeaning despite knowing so. But in the football world, this was loyalty and rallying to a worthy cause!</p>
<p>Twain frowned. He did not want to let Piqué go—not because the team must have Piqué. The La Masia kid’s position was different from Ribéry’s position—the reason was this: which manager would not want to have more and more capable players under their command and not fewer and fewer?</p>
<p>To be honest, there was one player in the team who could replace Piqué now. It was Belgium’s hopeful star, Vincent Kompany. But Twain felt sore to just let Piqué go in vain.</p>
<p>After considering it for a long time, Twain chose to resign to fate. He had urged him to stay and did all he could. He could only surrender to fate. Some things could not be settled with hard work. In Piqué’s case, “destiny” obviously surpassed the “facts of life” with overwhelming advantage.</p>
<p>Twain finally nodded his head slowly and imperceptibly. “Well, I understand what you’re thinking. I don’t think it’s appropriate to force you to stay, and I don’t want to destroy my relationship with you. So… that’s it.” He spread his hands a little helplessly.</p>
<p>Piqué did not smile. He straightened his back and said to Twain as he sat on the soft couch, “Boss, I like you and my teammates. I also love this team and the fans. Although I’m a player who graduated from La Masia, I’m equally aware that without you and Nottingham Forest, there would be the Gerard Piqué of today.”</p>
<p>Twain was stunned by his inexplicable words. He froze where he was and did not know what had happened. Could it be that Piqué suddenly had “a prickling of his conscience” and changed his mind about leaving? What was going on?</p>
<p>“I know the club’s financial situation is not good at the moment … In fact, I like to play here under you, boss. I do not know why, but I feel very relaxed. I want to give you a farewell gift. You won’t refuse, right?”</p>
<p>Twain opened his mouth as he became more and more confused.</p>
<p>“With my cooperation, Barcelona may need to raise the offer again.” At this point, Piqué finally smiled. But he smiled deviously and somewhat embarrassed too.</p>
<p>Twain did not smiled. He looked straight in the eyes at this center back who would soon no longer be his player and could no longer call him “boss.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>A day later, Nottingham Forest officially responded to Barcelona’s ten million offer–they refused!</p>
<p>“With two Champions Leagues titles, one Premier League victory, the absolute main stay and core defender in my team, how can he be only worth ten million?” Twain said angrily in an interview, “I don’t believe Barcelona can’t show enough good faith.” Everyone in the industry knew that Twain was used to refer to “money” as “good faith.””You know, they’ve spent almost one hundred million euros this summer.” In fact, it was not quite one hundred million. Barcelona had spent seventy-three million euros so far.</p>
<p>Then it was not known how Piqué asked his agent to talk Barcelona. In fact, the general meaning could be guessed—it was certain that Piqué wanted to go back to Barcelona! But! Nottingham Forest would never let go of their main center back so easily. Furthermore, everyone knew what kind of man Tony Twain was in European football. All the negative words created by all mankind were not enough to be used to describe him… And analyzing this rationally, this was not about his reluctance to let go of the main center back. It was clear that Nottingham Forest thought the money was too little. Did they not heard that they were building a new stadium now? The supposedly sixty thousand-seater stadium must cost a lot of money…</p>
<p>Barcelona’s second offer soon came, which was sixteen million pounds! About twenty million euros!</p>
<p>To offer such a bid for a center back, one of the important reasons was because Piqué was a Catalan in addition to the fact that he was a defender who had proven himself. Guardiola was an authentic product of Barcelona. He cared more about keeping the purity of the pedigree more than his predecessor, Rijkaard. As a result, he cleaned up a large number of players from the former dynasty. One of the reasons was because he believed that as long as the player was not a real Catalan and Barcelona person, he could not really give one hundred percent of his effort and loyalty to this team. This group of people could not be relied upon. Look at what Ronaldinho, Deco and Eto’o had done in the past two seasons…</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest did not care what Guardiola thought since they felt good about this price anyway and nodded their agreement.</p>
<p>And so, the young Gerard Piqué who was made off with by Tony Twain from La Masia, went through the trials and finally made his mark. When he was tired, he wanted to go back to his roots, so he returned to his original hometown of Barcelona. It was a touching development.</p>
<p>A cheesy inspirational story of adventure…</p>
<p>There was no ceremony during the farewell. The Nottingham Forest team were in training at Wilford. For these professional players, it was simply a person leaving. Such a scene would be repeated every summer. At first there would be people who felt sad, and now after their experience in professional football, they were used to it.</p>
<p>Piqué packed up his things he had put in his locker in the locker room and carried his bags to the training ground to say goodbye to Twain.</p>
<p>“I did not think you’d come specifically…” Twain was a little surprised.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to take another look, boss.” Piqué stood by his side and looked at the grassy training ground. His former teammates were training hard on it. The assistant manager, David Kerslake’s ever-vibrant voice rang out constantly to remindi these people not to be lazy.</p>
<p>“When I came here from La Masia, I never thought there would be today. I thought I wouldn’t have that kind of feeling about another training ground except for La Masia and Barcelona. Thank you, boss.”</p>
<p>“I’m not your coach anymore. We will be enemies the next time we meet and these people here are…” Twain pointed to the training ground and said, “You know, how Nottingham Forest has always been to the enemies…”</p>
<p>“No mercy.” Piqué helped him finish the sentence.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you know.”</p>
<p>“So, I’m leaving, boss.”</p>
<p>Only then Twain turned to look at him. He opened his mouth, “I mean in the event that, if, just in case, if, perhaps … if it turns out that you might not be able to stay in Barcelona, you can come here.”</p>
<p>“Then I must be too old to play football at that time.”</p>
<p>“Did not you hear what was said outside? ‘Nottingham Forest is a nursing home!'” Twain laughed.</p>
<p>“I’m a Catalan.”</p>
<p>“This fact really annoys me.”</p>
<p>“If I wasn’t a Catalan, I’d be in the Forest team playing out my remaining years, boss.”</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as ‘if’ in reality…” This fact made him feel helpless. Demetrio had also said a similar thing to him in the same tone.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Gerard. I wish you all the best.” He turned his face back and continued to look at the field.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, boss.” Piqué turned and strode away from the sunny Wilford. His agent was already waiting for him in the parking lot, from which they would go straight to Heathrow and then fly back home.</p>
<p>The wandering son had finally returned home, like a falling leaf returning to its roots. In this dense Nottingham Forest, after more than a hundred years of precipitation and accumulation where the soil below had long been covered, the ground was covered with layers of thick leaves, but not one leaf was called “Gerard Piqué.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 671: Double “Wood” Is “Woods”, And Triple “Wood” Can Be Counted As “Forest”</p>
<p>Piqué’s departure gave Twain a clear look at the current situation—he thought the team was weak in the areas of the left and right backs, but now he suddenly discovered that his center back area was already a bit stretched. The team’s original main partnership was Pepe and Piqué, with Kompany and Ayala for the second set. Now, Piqué was gone, and Ayala was old. The real players who could play were Pepe and Piqué, while Morgan could only get a chance to play in the tournaments such as EFL Cup and English FA Cup. He could not be expected to play in the important tournaments.</p>
<p>In that case, he had to put aside the search for a full back and prioritize to solve the center back issue. The full back could be a little weak, but the center back could not be weak.</p>
<p>It was already August, less than half a month before the start of the new season. It was less than ten days from the FA Community Shield.</p>
<p>This summer, the team’s signing of new players had been slow. This was due to a number of reasons. First of all, because of their successes these two seasons, Twain believed that the structure of the team was very sound and did not want to adjust too much. So, he had decided not to buy a large number of new players. Secondly, most of the players whom Twain was interested were “already taken” and they were reluctant to leave their new clubs. Thirdly, the Nottingham Forest Football Club could not afford to take out too much to support Twain’s moves in the transfer market. Not only that, they also needed Twain to cough up with the money he earned from the sale of the players to “make up for the household expenses.”</p>
<p>For a UEFA Champions League winner to live like this, Nottingham Forest could be alone in that.</p>
<p>As for the full back position, Twain had drooled with desire for a player four years ago. He thought it would be a good time to make his move this summer, only to have another door shut in his face.</p>
<p>It was Manchester City’s Micah Richards. The tall player could play both center back and right back, which was very much in line with Twain’s desire for the players to be versatile.</p>
<p>When he had approached Stuart Pearce with an offer to buy him a few years ago, he was flatly turned down. Helplessly, he had to buy Sun Jihai. Now that Pearce had left Manchester City, the Manchester City club was in another different crisis. Twain thought this was a good time to buy Richards. With Nottingham Forest’s reputation as a Double Winner, would it not be easy to beckon Richards?</p>
<p>He was wrong.</p>
<p>The Manchester City club did have some difficulties at the moment. The Thai government had issued a notice to freeze Mr. Thaksin’s assets. It would be difficult for Thaksin, who had lost most of his fortune, to try to keep the Manchester City club running. With so much trouble around, who could care about a small football club? There were many rumors that a certain consortium was interested in Manchester City and wanted to buy it. But Mr. Thaksin himself denied it. He admitted that things were not going well, but the Manchester City club was still in his name and everything was under control.</p>
<p>Twain did not believe this Thai man’s words. The Manchester City club must be in trouble. He might be able to pry the players, such as Richards who usually could not be moved, at this time.</p>
<p>He jubilantly made an offer, but the Manchester City club directly rejected it without even hearing it—“Richards is not for sale.”</p>
<p>He raised the offer again only to hear that same answer—“Micah . . .Richards is not for sale.”</p>
<p>He tried again for the third time and this time it was slightly different. “We don’t want to sell Richards to a direct competitor.”</p>
<p>That infuriated Twain. How dare Manchester City label my team as “a direct competitor?” That’s an overestimation of themselves?! My team is a Double Winner which had won the UEFA Champions League title for two years in a row. Where does your Manchester City team rank? I’m the only tough one here who reject other people’s offers. How dare that Mark Hughes act so arrogantly in front of me! (He had long since forgotten the fact that Hughes was older and more experienced than him…))</p>
<p>He did not make a fourth offer, as it would have made Nottingham Forest lowly in front of the pompous Manchester City. Twain did not want to bow to anyone. Sell to whomever you want to sell to! Even if it rots in your own mouth, it’s none of my business!</p>
<p>In this way, a seed of hatred against Manchester City was planted Twain’s heart. The friendly relationship between the two clubs during Pearce’s time remained in name but was lost in reality due to Richards.</p>
<p>As a result, the saying among the media that Twain was a narrow-minded person, was right…</p>
<p>With the deal and relationship gone, Twain could only continue to look for other candidates.</p>
<p>He wanted to buy Carvalho but Scolari would not let him go. His reason was the same as Manchester City—“We don’t sell our important players to our direct competitors.” Twain was not angry that Chelsea said that, because Chelsea was indeed Nottingham Forest’s rival.</p>
<p>The Argentine, Garay was signed by Real Madrid; A. S. Roma would not let Juan go; Ronaldo was unwilling to leave Werder Bremen…</p>
<p>In the end, Twain could only cast his search back to England.</p>
<p>This time, Twain was not going to buy a young center back anymore. What mattered in the rear defensive line was experience, which was often proportional to age. Therefore, Twain plan to have a slightly younger center back.</p>
<p>He set his sights on Jonathan Woodgate who was still at Middlesbrough.</p>
<p>He played only nine games in the two years for Real Madrid due to frequent injuries and was called an “English patient” by the Spanish media. He even became an example of an injury-prone player in the football world. But he had done well at Middlesbrough in recent years, with his injuries seemingly long gone. Under the instruction of Southgate, the former well-known England defender, he had improved considerably and become the captain of Middlesbrough. With at least two chances to play against each other each season, Twain naturally paid attention to this former Real Madrid player. After he observed him for a few seasons, Twain discovered that Woodgate was the man the team needed. He decided to make a move.</p>
<p>Originally, Ramos was due to take this former England center back to White Hart Lane in January, but Tottenham Hotspur and Middlesbrough had not agreed on a transfer fee. Both parties officially announced the collapse of this transfer deal before the winter transfer window closed. Hence, Woodgate stayed at Middlesbrough.</p>
<p>The “English patient” who emerged from Real Madrid’s shadow regained his confidence at Middlesbrough and now was the time to look forward to a new future. The failure to join Tottenham Hotspur, which was eligible for the Champions League, frustrated Woodgate a little. However, it did not matter. He would soon know what the meaning of the Chinese idiom “to lose at sunrise but gain at sunset.”</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest made an eight million pounds offer to Middlesbrough in the hope of taking Woodgate away. Anyway, the money not spent also had to be returned to the club. Twain did not care about one or two million less at this point—Tottenham Hotspur’s offer to Middlesbrough was 6.5 million, which they finally increased to seven million and refused to increase further.</p>
<p>Eight million was the price that Middlesbrough wanted. And Southgate was already clear on one thing and that was—Woodgate’s heart was no longer at the Riverside Stadium. He was so happy when Tottenham Hotspur wanted to buy him. How could the twenty-eight-year-old center back not be tempted now that it was the higher-level Nottingham Forest?</p>
<p>Soon the Middlesbrough manager saw Woodgate’s statement in an interview with the local media in Nottingham in the newspapers: “I think it’s time to go to a bigger stage to pursue my dreams…”</p>
<p>Even though he hated to let him go, Southgate knew the limits of the club, and Middlesbrough would never be able to keep the players whom the big clubs were interested in.</p>
<p>In the end, Woodgate joined Nottingham Forest for eight million pounds and signed a three-year contract. The details were not disclosed to public, but it was said to be definitely higher than when he was at Middlesbrough.</p>
<p>His signing was dubbed by the English media as “Nottingham Forest has become a veritable forest, with a pile of wood in the team.” It referred to George Wood, Freddy Eastwood and the just joined Jonathan Woodgate. Moreover, it was a coincidence that these three “woods” formed the team’s central axis in terms of their positions—striker, midfielder and center back.</p>
<p>The Chinese media used their style to explain this interesting coincidence: “The two Woods make up the (Sher)wood and the three Woods now make up the Forest. They have the Woods and Forest. Nottingham Forest finally proves itself to be “The Forest.”</p>
<p>The Chinese media used their style to explain this interesting coincidence: “The double Woods make up ‘林’ and the three Woods now make up ‘森’. They have the ‘森’ and ‘林’. Nottingham Forest finally proves itself to be the ‘森林.'”</p>
<p>Twain was in a good mood after he solved the center back problem. At the press conference for the signing and to welcome Woodgate, he joked with the reporters, “If a player has ‘Wood’ in his name, congratulations to that guy. He’ll have a good chance of joining us at Nottingham Forest!”</p>
<p>Woodgate also said, “I am very happy to join Nottingham Forest. I don’t mind people making fun of my name. This means I have a connection with Nottingham Forest. Coming here, I want to help the team win more championships. Injuries? That’s a thing of the past…”</p>
<p>These words were still ringing in everyone’s ears when Woodgate left training with an injury the next day…</p>
<p>It was a good thing that it was only a minor injury in a check-up after the game and would not affect the new season. It was just that a lot of injuries made Woodgate a little sensitive.</p>
<p>Twain could breathe sigh of relief, “Luckily it was nothing. Otherwise I’m going to be the laughingstock of the whole of England.”</p>
<p>“This was supposed to be a gamble. Woodgate was never a strong center back.” Dunn said, “Since you decide to buy him, you have to be able to withstand the psychological pressure he will bring you since his injury.”</p>
<p>“We rotate anyway.” Twain shrugged.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Four days after Woodgate arrived at Nottingham Forest, the team had their first game of the new season—the FA Community Shield held at the new Wembley Stadium against the English FA Cup winner, Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Although this was the first time that Twain and his team had played in the FA Community Shield, they displayed the strength of the Double Winner of Premier League and Champions League. Portsmouth simply could not withstand.</p>
<p>And the rotation for the new season had been put in place since the start of this game.</p>
<p>The newly joined Tiago replaced George Wood and appeared in the team’s starting lineup. Woodgate and Şahin sat in the stands and were not in the squad list.</p>
<p>Şahin was still undergoing psychological treatment, while Woodgate was injured the following day he joined the team.</p>
<p>Petrov replaced Ribéry’s position in the starting lineup. Van der Vaart was still the attacking midfielder while young Lennon was on the right. The strikers were Bendtner and Arshavin. Starting this season, Twain would continue to increase Bendtner’s chances for appearances, gradually making him the team’s leading striker.</p>
<p>The center back was a partnership between Ayala and Kompany, with Pepe on the bench after losing his regular partner. The left back was Bale and the right back was Sun Jihai. The goalkeeper was changed to Akinfeev.</p>
<p>Since the start of this season, the EFL Cup had made a major change. For many years, the EFL Cup’s substitutes’ bench was limited to five players, leaving many players without the chance to make it to the squad list. To some extent, this rule was not suitable for the development of English football, because the absence of two positions was equivalent to the lack of two opportunities to train players. Ferguson’s suggestion to the Football Association last season to add the substitutes’ positions to the international standard of seven players was echoed by seven clubs immediately. And Tony Twain was the first manager to come forward to show his approval and support. Even Ferguson’s nemesis, Arsène Wenger, was on the same side as Ferguson this time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the English Football Association readily accepted the suggestion and increased the number of bench places from five to seven at the start of the new season.</p>
<p>Now on the substitutes’ bench for Nottingham Forest were van der Sar, Pepe, Baines, George Wood, Ribéry, van Nistelrooy and Beckham. This was the absolute mainstay of the team last season.</p>
<p>More than half a season ago, when Twain challenged Portsmouth with a lineup that was similar to the current starting lineup, the Portsmouth people thought they had been insulted and that Nottingham Forest was too arrogant. Now, they would never thought so again because they had learned a very deep lesson…</p>
<p>Consequently, in this game, Portsmouth’s new manager, Tony Adams adopted the stance to cling fast to defense in an attempt to pull Nottingham Forest into a bitter fight.</p>
<p>This summer, Tony Twain had instructed the team to practice how to deal with the enemy’s intense defensive attack, especially the attacks from the middle. He was not surprised by Portsmouth’s approach. Today’s Nottingham Forest was attacked on all sides. Any team which played against them would not be foolish enough to rush up to attack. That would only cause their own demise faster.</p>
<p>Steady counterattack was the way. Just like how Nottingham Forest won…</p>
<p>However, they picked the wrong opponent.</p>
<p>Twain asked the team to strengthen the long shot and coordination in the middle to continue to attack in the middle. They might not be able to score immediately, but it could give the opponent a huge psychological pressure, while messing up their play at the same time. His arrangement paid off in the 21st minute when Nottingham Forest’s high pressing tactic left Portsmouth dizzy. The French defender, Distin did an own goal and Nottingham Forest took the lead with 1-0.</p>
<p>For Nottingham Forest, the game was easier to play after the lead. The other side must press out to play so that the Forest could retreat to hit the opponent’s counterattack. That was the biggest headache for their opponent…</p>
<p>Trailing behind, Portsmouth was at its wit’s end as it faced Nottingham Forest which retreated to defend as it waited to strike their counterattack—they certainly could not put too much forces into the attack because they had to be wary of Forest’s counterattacks. But if they did not increase their attack, it would be a bit difficult to break through the Forest team’s iron wall with Portsmouth’s current strength… This became a paradox. If they did not attack, they could not score and equalize the score. If they could not equalize the score, they would lose the game; But if they attacked, they could continue to lose the ball which would still cause them to lose. If they dared not invest more players in the attack for fear of continuing to concede the goal, then they would still lose when they put in the forces for the offense …</p>
<p>Unlike the paradoxical Portsmouth, it was much easier for Nottingham Forest to pull the game into their familiar orbit after they got ahead. Portsmouth did not come out of this paradox until the end of the first half. Therefore, Nottingham Forest ended the first half with a 1-0 lead.</p>
<p>During the halftime interval, Manager Adams asked the team to show courage in the locker room and not to worry about this or that. They should equalize the score first. Furthermore, Tiago had just joined the Forest team not for long, so the team’s cooperation still had problems. Ayala was getting old and his reaction was not as good as before. His physical quality had also declined… As long as the Portsmouth players were willing to rush, they could certainly find a breakthrough from these two people!</p>
<p>With their fighting spirit and confidence restored, Portsmouth returned to the field with a spirited attempt to equalize the score. This time they found that the people standing in front of them had changed. Tiago, who still did not have a rapport with the team, was replaced by the captain, George Wood. The older Ayala who could not keep up with the pace, was replaced by the strong Pepe…</p>
<p>When George Wood stared at the Portsmouth players with a cold expression in his eyes, it sent shivers down the Pompey’s backs.</p>
<p>In the final stage of the game, Portsmouth launched a suicide attack. It was heroic and sad at the same time. Nottingham Forest, which had waited for the entire game, finally got their best chance to fight back. George Wood did a long pass from the backfield, and Bendtner leaned his body against the only center back to stop the ball and broke into the penalty area to volley a shot. After it was pounced on by the goalkeeper, Arshavin followed up with a shot. 2:0! Nottingham Forest locked in the victory to win their first title of the new season.</p>
<p>“It looks like Nottingham Forest continued the good form from last season. Nottingham Forest controlled the pace of the game the entire time. Poor Portsmouth, the gap in their strength and experience caused them to lose the game…”</p>
<p>The television commentator summed up the game in this way.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>This championship title had another meaning in addition to another new trophy that Twain had won. He had let the new players got the first taste of Nottingham Forest’s style and tradition—defensive counterattacks and the championship trophies.</p>
<p>This would help them integrate quickly into the team and play their parts earlier.</p>
<p>In fact, the FA Community Shield Cup was not a big deal. In the early years, it was considered a terrible “curse” —whichever team that won this season’s FA Community Shield Cup, would surely lose the Premier League title. Now that the spell was broken, no one took this championship too seriously.</p>
<p>It was like how Tony Twain acted in this game—he rotated half of the main force and half of the substitutes which hinted strongly that he was training the players, as if it was still a summer friendly match. Only Portsmouth, lacking in honors, would take it seriously and really treat this game as a final to play. Unfortunately, they were somewhat inferior in strength and could only nurse their grievance as they returned.</p>
<p>For the Nottingham Forest fans who had experience the victories of major titles in two years, the FA Community Shield was only a minor victory. But it gave them a good reason to get together for a celebration.</p>
<p>No matter how lowly the title was, they still lifted their glasses and roared:</p>
<p>“To the endless championship titles! To the insufferable Tony! To our dearest Nottingham Forest… Cheers!!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 672: New Capital, New Season</p>
<p>After they won the FA Community Shield and with only five days to go until the start of the new season, something shocking happened in the English football world.</p>
<p>When this shocking incident first occurred, it was only a minor shock, and not many people took it seriously. But its impact gradually spread over time, and everyone suddenly woke up overnight—this could perhaps be a shock that would change the Premier League structure!</p>
<p>On August 11th, United Arab Emirates’ Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment announced that it had formally acquired Thaksin’s Manchester City Football Club under his name. Thaksin Shinawatra, the former club chairman would become the honorary president and did not have any real power. Like Abramovich’s acquisition of Chelsea, Bates continued to act as the chairman of the club for some time before his departure.</p>
<p>This piece of news came so suddenly that many people had not yet reacted.</p>
<p>While everyone knew that the Manchester City boss, Thaksin Shinawatra had a difficult time in the recent months and that his fortune had plummeted as a result of the investigations in Thailand, no one thought he would really just sell the club he held for a year!</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, when he took ownership of the Manchester City Football Club, the Manchester City fans did not express much dissatisfaction because they were eager for championship titles—Chelsea’s success had made many other English teams’ fans aware that a huge influx of foreign assets was the new impetus for a team’s redevelopment. Thaksin had injected more than half a billion pounds into his new team. Manchester City was even at the top of the league table at one point in the first part of the season. Therefore, the local media exclaimed: Manchester City is about to usher in “Thaksin’s Era!”</p>
<p>While these words still rang in one’s ears, the Manchester City boss had changed.</p>
<p>The Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment was headquartered in Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, which was a city made up of more than a dozen islands. It was now the richest place in the United Arab Emirates and the world, with a per capita wealth of up to seventeen million US dollars. Their investments abroad reached almost one trillion US dollars!</p>
<p>The secret to their success laid with the fact that a quarter of the world’s oil was at their feet, and the Abu Dhabi United Group for Development and Investment dealt in oil explorations and investments. On top of that, Abu Dhabi’s behind the scenes supporter was the United Arab Emirates’ royal family.</p>
<p>The British tabloids immediately dug up the news behind the club’s change of hands. They claimed that after their investigations, the Abu Dhabi consortium, led by the oil trader, Al-Fahim, had ten times as much wealth as Abramovich. This news shocked the whole of England.</p>
<p>Abramovich was scary enough when he first came to England. Over the past two years Abramovich’s investments gradually leaned toward rational, but everyone still remembered the storm he set off when he first arrived in 2003 and the impact could still be felt till now… Now that there was the richer Abu Dhabi consortium, all the clubs had to be careful that the core players of their teams being poached.</p>
<p>The statement did not indicate how much money was involved in the deal, with the number coming out of the tabloids listing it at two hundred million pounds. Thaksin made a small profit, and it could be seen from this that the reason he fled Manchester City was simply he was disappointed that Manchester City did not win the title, or because he now had no money and needed to sell the club to cash in.</p>
<p>Some media said that August 11th, 2008 would be the most memorable day for this 130-year-old club since its birth. It was enough to be compared to the birth of the team. The subtext was that the Manchester City Football Club could take advantage of this opportunity to be reborn. Chelsea’s yesterday was their present and Chelsea’s today would be their tomorrow. The todays of Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona, AC Milan, Inter Milan and other powerhouse clubs would be their tomorrow. However, in fact, their nearest goal that should be the goal most likely to achieve would be to become the next Nottingham Forest …</p>
<p>As the team’s manager, Mark Hughes indicated his welcome of the arrival of the new boss on behalf of his team.</p>
<p>“… I know that money is not everything, but this is still something we can look forward to—we now have enough money to be used in the transfer market to find the players we need… You know, what that’s like. I mean, I feel good now that we have the prerequisites to be a successful team. Maybe I should set a target for my team to enter next season’s Champions League?”</p>
<p>Look, Mark Hughes, who had never been so rich, was so happy that he talked without rhyme or reason…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain only learned the news when he read the newspaper at breakfast. Although it was not new news that foreign investment had been flowing into the English Premier League since a few years ago, perhaps the combined assets of those foreign bosses together could not be compared to the Abu Dhabi consortium…</p>
<p>He held the fork in his mouth as he stared in a daze at the picture of Al-Fahim in the newspaper.</p>
<p>He wondered what kind of impact the arrival of the new boss would have on Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>He first thought of Ribéry. He was never at ease with the player with a rotten agent. With the transfer deal to Real Madrid fallen through, would this agent, who was unwilling to be left out of the action, pull another stunt again and flirt with the wealthy Manchester City club? And encouraged Ribéry to move to Manchester City?</p>
<p>Thinking about it, Twain rejected this hypothesis. Even if Manchester City were able to offer a salary of five million pounds a week, Ribéry would not have gone to a team which could not even win an honor. He wanted to go to Real Madrid because on the one hand, Real Madrid could meet his salary requirements while on the other hand, Real Madrid itself was a world-renowned powerhouse club, where it was very likely for him to obtain the honors and received the world’s attention. But what would he accomplish if he went to Manchester City? No matter how rich this team was, could it become the champion of the Premier League and UEFA Champions League overnight?</p>
<p>Twain gave a derisive snort.</p>
<p>He did not make this judgment because he had a bad impression of Manchester City from the incident with Richards a while ago. It was because he really despised the strength of the Manchester City team. Mark Hughes was not a successful manager. Twain did not think he could lead Manchester City to achieve any accomplishments.</p>
<p>You think you can be arrogant just because you have money? Can you buy all the world’s heroes with money?</p>
<p>Dream on, Mark Hughes.</p>
<p>You may be able to afford the money, but it doesn’t mean my players will want to go!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the days that followed, while nervously preparing for the new season and watching the oil daddy-backed Manchester City club made waves in the transfer market, and constantly hit the wall, all these became Twain’s life.</p>
<p>The whole world knew that Manchester United was in pursuit of Berbatov, and the world knew that Berbatov had long “given his heart” to Ferguson. And now the world was waiting for the Tottenham Hotspur boss Levy to nod his assent after he raised the price high enough.</p>
<p>If it was not for Twain’s satisfaction with his forward deployment, perhaps he would have gotten involved in Berbatov’s transfer.</p>
<p>Now his secret idea had been realized by Manchester City. The new owner announced the bid for Berbatov on the first day of his arrival.</p>
<p>As a pair of mortal enemies in the same city, Manchester City was happy to do whatever it took to make Manchester United uncomfortable. They might not really need Berbatov, but they definitely wanted to oppose Manchester United.</p>
<p>This infuriated Ferguson. He was just about to succeed when Manchester City’s bid raised Berbatov’s worth to twenty-nine million pounds. Levy, the sly and greedy fox, thought about it and rejected Manchester United’s offer. He pretended to hesitate whether to accept Manchester City’s offer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just as AC Milan and Barcelona were chasing after Adebayor, Manchester City made its move.</p>
<p>Despite knowing that Wenger would not agree to Adebayor’s departure, Manchester City still offered a high price of twenty-eight million pounds. Wenger took this opportunity to reject offers from AC Milan and Barcelona, while he offered Adebayor a new contract for a weekly fee of eighty thousand pounds which waited for his signature to take effect.</p>
<p>Mourinho finally ended his reclusive life at home and returned to his post. This time he landed at the Serie A powerhouse club, Inter Milan. Having just arrived at Inter Milan, there was news that he wanted to take Lampard and Drogba. On the other hand, Real Madrid also wanted to bring in a good center forward and was also keen on Drogba. This time it was Manchester City again who disrupted things and turned a transfer deal into a mess.</p>
<p>It was only the first day that Manchester City had given the whole of European football a glimpse of their style… which was annoying.</p>
<p>Twain did not know what Manchester City’s purpose was in doing so. Was it fun to antagonize everyone? Could it be they were putting on a performance art? Or was Abu Dhabi really an idiot who knew nothing about football and thought that anyone could be bought with money?</p>
<p>The results of these three transfer deals showed them.</p>
<p>When Berbatov saw that the despicable Levy wanted to go back on his word, he immediately came forward for an interview and publicly stated that “he must have Manchester United and no other team.” Manchester City wanted to buy him? Let them wait for the next life!</p>
<p>Manchester City’s offer scared away AC Milan and Barcelona. Adebayor was annoyed, and he would never condescend to go to a small place like Manchester City, even if he had to stay at Arsenal! Consequently, he signed a new contract with Wenger.</p>
<p>As for Drogba? He did not even glance at Manchester City. Inter Milan and Real Madrid had an ambiguous attitude and eventually he stayed at Chelsea.</p>
<p>This bitter fact proved Twain’s previous assumption that having money did not guarantee that a desired player could be bought. The world of football was not a world that money was invincible. A second-tier team like Manchester City had a long way to go to become a god.</p>
<p>Out of a mentality that hated the rich, Twain took delight in Manchester City’s encounter. He liked to see the rich people deflated because he was not rich…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Unable to purchase the players he was keen on in the transfer market for a while, Twain intended to take his energy back and focus on the league tournament which was about to start. Anyway, it was still half a month away from the close of the summer transfer window. He would play while he searched.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest took on West Ham United in the first round of the new season. The opening game was Arsenal’s home game against West Bromwich Albion.</p>
<p>West Ham United was not a powerful opponent, but Twain attached importance to it because this was the first game of the new season after all.</p>
<p>The Chinese people paid particular attention to “The first step is always the hardest.” If the opening game was not good, Twain would think that it would bring negative impact to the whole season. From a superstitious point of view, a bad beginning was really a little unlucky …</p>
<p>Accordingly, the entire main force was deployed to play.</p>
<p>Van der Sar, Pepe, Kompany, Gareth Bale, Rafinha, George Wood, Van der Vaart, Ribéry, Beckham, van Nistelrooy and Eastwood played.</p>
<p>Such a lineup was at the championship level. Twain believed that this should fine for the away game.</p>
<p>As a result, the word “unlucky” came to his mind at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart was brutally shoveled to the ground by the West Ham United midfielder, Lee Bowyer after he took the ball in the midfield. When Bowyer shoveled van der Vaart down, he also made a “scissor legs” move and knocked van der Vaart’s left foot away. At the time, van der Vaart even made a gesture to request for a replacement as he laid on the ground. Only ten minutes had passed since the start of the game…</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Twain jumped out of his seat and swore. It was not only van der Vaart’s injury that angered him, but more so because Bowyer, the culprit, only received a verbal warning from the referee and did not even get a yellow card. He simply patted his buttocks and got up from the ground, pretending to come forward to comfort van der Vaart, but was pushed away by George Wood.</p>
<p>Bowyer covered his face and fell, sparking a clash between the players on both sides.</p>
<p>In the end, the referee gave George Wood a yellow card and also gave a yellow card to Behrami, who was active in the conflict, punishing both players before the two teams were separated.</p>
<p>“This asshole…” Twain certainly was not cursing George Wood. In actual fact, he was supportive of George Wood’s action. He was scolding Bowyer. After all these years, this scumbag still showed no sign of improvement. It did not look like this game at the JJB Stadium would be easy.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart was carried off on a stretcher and the team doctor, Fleming told Twain that he was absolutely not be able to play again in this game and had to be replaced. Şahin, who was still undergoing psychotherapy, did not come to London with the team. Twain had to bring on Petrov and let Ribéry go to the middle.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart’s injury disrupted the tactics and rhythm of Nottingham Forest. For some time, West Ham United dominated with its home advantage and bombarded Nottingham Forest’s penalty area.</p>
<p>Fortunately, George Wood was as consistent as ever and organized the defenders to put up two defensive areas in front of the goal. The West Ham United team had no better way to break through the Forest’s goal for a while.</p>
<p>But a good defense could still collapse in the face of an endless attack. At the end of the first half, the Welsh bad boy Bellamy forced his way through Rafinha using his speed and plugged into the penalty area from the side. He lifted his leg for a shot at a very narrow angle!</p>
<p>The football was pounced on by van der Sar for a bit before it hit the inside of the goalpost and bounced into the net…</p>
<p>“The defending champions entered a bitter fight in the away game! The West Ham United team informs the defending champion that the new season is definitely not going to be easy!”</p>
<p>Twain replaced Beckham with Lennon in the second half. With his excellent speed and breakthrough ability, Lennon did cause West Ham United a lot of trouble. His attack on the right flank was more penetrating than Beckham’s.</p>
<p>With this substitution adjustment, Nottingham Forest swept away the first-half slump. The score was equalized seventeen minutes into the second half. The goalscorer was van Nistelrooy. Lennon’s breakthrough resulted in a weak defense in the middle of the penalty area. The keen senses of the King of the Six-Yard Box helped him locate West Ham United’s fatal spot at the most crucial time.</p>
<p>Following which towards the end of the game, Nottingham Forest, which had not given up on the offense, scored another goal, which was scored by Ribéry. With a breakthrough from the middle and a long shot from top of the arc, the football shot into the West Ham United team’s goal like a shell. The commentator shouted “world-class ball” continuously.</p>
<p>Twain also excitedly jumped from his seat. The last-minute reversal killed West Ham United!</p>
<p>Despite winning the game, Twain did not mean to let go of anyone in the post-match press conference. He lashed out at Lee Bowyer for his lack of sportsmanship and then “questioned” the referee’s decision on the foul. His doubts were certainly more bluntly put than what was generally said.</p>
<p>“I can’t figure out why Bowyer did not even get a yellow card with this foul. It was only a verbal warning for such a bad foul. Could it be that someone did not want us to win? I’m sorry, but we still won in the end.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 673: Wealth of An Entire Nation</p>
<p>“Gabriel Agbonlahor! Agbonlahor! This is his third goal in this game! Agbonlahor scored a hat trick in less than eight minutes! Oh, ho ho—poor Manchester City!” “The cheers at Villa Park stadium were thunderous cheers as if there had been an earthquake here. The vigor stunned the visiting Manchester City fans, who sat dazedly in their seats as they watched that kid darted along the sidelines.</p>
<p>His name was Gabriel Agbonlahor and had been Aston Villa’s rising new star for the last two seasons. Now he was the absolute leading player in this game.</p>
<p>The Manchester City manager, Mark Hughes stood on the sidelines with his arms across his chest as he looked on helplessly at the celebratory crowd around him.</p>
<p>Just eight minutes earlier, his own team had just turned the score to 1:1 thanks to Elano’s penalty shot. He was still plotting how to take three points from this away game to give the new boss a perfect gift for their first meeting when over here, Aston Villa’s number 11 had already scored three goals in a row and completed a hat trick…</p>
<p>After the game, the away Manchester City team lost 1:4 and became the laughingstock of the media. Having just became a billionaire, they were crushed on the field which made people gleeful. It looked like there were a lot of people who hated the rich in England…</p>
<p>Once they returned to Manchester from Birmingham, the first thing that Mark Hughes did was to go to the club’s owner and tell him that the summer would be over soon if he still did not make a move—Manchester City were slow to make a move in the transfer market due to Thaksin’s problems earlier. Except to buy back Shaun Wright-Phillips, there was no other move to be commended about.</p>
<p>Before he could leave to look for his boss, an Arab man in a white headscarf found him.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Mr. Mark Hughes.” That man was very polite.</p>
<p>Hughes did not know him, but he was not surprised. Since the club changed its owner overnight, the number of unfamiliar faces had increased.</p>
<p>“I’m Mr. Fahim’s assistant, Osamu.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Mr. Osamu, good morning. What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>In fact, it could probably be estimated that Osamu looking for him was equivalent to Fahim looking for him.</p>
<p>“Mr. Fahim thinks the team should make some big changes. He wants Mr. Hughes to come up with a list and give it to him.”</p>
<p>In the face of such a good thing, Hughes shook his head and said, “Mr. Osamu, I have no doubt that Mr. Fahim wants the team to be stronger. But now that the new season has already begun, implementing big changes in the lineup will only bring about worse results. Of course, we need to adjust the current squad, but not now.”</p>
<p>“In that case, can you tell me which areas the team needs players the most at the moment?”</p>
<p>This time Hughes immediately blurted out, “Strikers.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Manchester City’s forward line was terrible.</p>
<p>The game against Aston Villa looked like something was wrong with the rear defensive line, but in fact the root cause was in the forward line. When the striker could not pose a threat to the enemy’s goal, the other side’s offensive would be unbridled.</p>
<p>After Thaksin took ownership of the team last season, he brought in a lot of new people to the team, but the quality was really underwhelming …</p>
<p>The first thing that Mark Hughes did since he took over this summer, was to clean up the players he did not need in the team. He drove away five strikers in one go on the forward line.</p>
<p>Corradi was sold to Reggina Calcio, Bianchi was sold to Turin, Samaras sold to Celtic, while the contracts of Dickov and Mpenza were terminated by the club.</p>
<p>The only strikers left in the team that could be used were Vassell, Benjamin Mwaruwari, Bojinov and Sturridge. Sturridge was the team’s future star, but he was still a little young.</p>
<p>Looking at this lineup, there was hardly a goalscorer among them. Moreover, looking at the top five teams in the Premier League, every single one of them had a leading goalscorer. Manchester United had Rooney, Ronaldo and Tevez, Liverpool had Torres, Arsenal had Adebayor and Eduardo da Silva, Chelsea had Drogba, and Nottingham Forest had van Nistelrooy.</p>
<p>The Manchester City new boss’s bold and visionary words held a prominent position in the media. As a team that had always wanted to win all the championship titles and reach the Champions League, it was wretched not to have a striker who was of a good enough level….</p>
<p>The position suggested by Mark Hughes also received Osamu’s approval. He nodded and said, “It won’t be long before you, Mr. Mark Hughes, can have a lot of world-class strikers.”</p>
<p>Mark Hughes was alarmed instead. He feared the club would waste time on the players who would not come at all. He hurriedly said, “I hope it’s as soon as possible. We don’t have much time, Mr. Osamu. The summer transfer window only had half a month left. If we can’t find anyone, we have to wait until January…”</p>
<p>“Please rest assured on this, Mr. Hughes. We have a big plan, but it will take time. Don’t worry. The striker position will be fulfilled at the first instance.”</p>
<p>With that, Osamu turned and left. He was now a busy man. Although the Manchester City club had a general manager, this personal assistant was better to employ in front of Fahim…</p>
<p>Mark Hughes shook his head as he looked at this Arab man’s back. It had only been a week from the initial excitement over a huge influx of capital pouring into the club to the current calmness. Because he had seen first-hand how the star players simply rejected Manchester City.</p>
<p>Manchester City was not Chelsea in those years. For most of the players, it lacked appeal. Some things could not be achieved simply by having money.</p>
<p>Abramovich’s money was only one reason Chelsea was so attractive during that time. The most important reason was that, with the foreshadowing of Hoddle, Gullit, Vialli and Ranieri, Chelsea was already an emerging power outside the Premier League’s traditional top three at the time. In addition to being in the top four in the league for a long time, they were basically considered certain to be a powerhouse for winning the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup. Under such circumstances, they could immediately take on a new lease of life with the capital injection.</p>
<p>Manchester City was different. Although they represented Manchester longer than Manchester United which was an outsider, their results were really a tragic sight. Their best results were four FA Cups and one UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup which happened a long time ago, which held no appeal to the players today. More people just thought of them as a traditional Premier League mid-stream team.</p>
<p>How many world-class players would condescend to join this team that might not even be able to play in next season’s UEFA Europa League just for the money?</p>
<p>According to Hughes’ train of thought, Manchester City’s rebuilding required at least three to four years, through small victories and trophies to re-establish their foundation and change Manchester City’s image as a low-level team in everyone’s mind. Then it would be the road to becoming a powerhouse…</p>
<p>However, his new boss was impatient and obviously could not wait that long. Furthermore, he had a lot of inestimable pounds. He admitted himself that he was buying time with money. He wanted Manchester City to become the world’s number one team that all the world-class star players scrambled to join overnight. He was serious about the team becoming the new Manchester United and new Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Mark Hughes now felt that sitting in the Manchester City manager’s position was not an enviable job. With such an ambitious club owner who knew nothing about football and a second-rate team… the harsh reality made him feel like he was sitting on the edge of a volcanic crater. If he did not produce the results, the boss would dismiss him and not reflect on what went wrong with his strategy. The most commonly seen and simplest way was usually to change the managers. Therefore, the poor manager became a scapegoat. He not only lost his job, but also had a stain on his coaching career.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After the first round of the league tournament ended, Tony Twain once again made the headlines in the sports pages of various media outlets. His words in his post-match press conference that “someone doesn’t want us to win” offended the English Football Association and the Referees’ Association, and for which he received a fine of fifteen thousand pounds as well as a one-match ban from the Football Association.</p>
<p>[The Sun] mocked that Tony Twain was probably the manager with the greatest number of bans in modern football history. They unceremoniously pointed out that Twain was a “moron who speaks from his ass instead of using his head.”</p>
<p>This time Twain did not fight back because he was “muffled” by the club. Evan Doughty barred Twain from shooting his mouth off and cause trouble for himself and the club again. Thanks to Twain’s big mouth, Nottingham Forest had become the most difficult “thorn on the side” in the eyes of the English Football Association, the Referees’ Association and the Englsih Premier League committee. No matter the occasion, they would always receive some “special treatment” that no one else enjoyed.</p>
<p>As a result, Twain was very quiet. He sullenly looked on as the media taunted and sneered.</p>
<p>At this point, another incident happened which distracted the media’s attention. No one laughed at him anymore, but this situation made him even more annoyed.</p>
<p>Manchester City had announced that they had already issued a blank cheque to Nottingham Forest for their leading striker, van Nistelrooy!</p>
<p>If it were successful, it could be the significant transfer in the world. Never before had a club been so contemptuous of the rules of the world like Manchester City. The other clubs would plan and calculate meticulously with the sale or purchase of players and try to maximize the benefits. There would be a lot of behind-the-scene stories every year at the negotiating table during the transfer window. The team managers, professional agents, players and managers together were scenes right out of a movie.</p>
<p>But Manchester City’s emergence broke the traditional transfer rules. First, it provoked Manchester United, Real Madrid and the other big clubs. Then it tried to seduce the star players of other teams. Now they made an even more amazing move—they threw money which the other teams saw as a lifeline, around like it was dirt. That way, they acted as if they looked on high over all living things, and then used a cold and conceited voice to inform the others, “How much is your player worth? Name your price, there is no one in the world that we can’t buy. Don’t think small and drag your feet. Give a number and write however much you want. If you write too low, I may say you are not sincere.”</p>
<p>Twain was furious.</p>
<p>He found Evan and Allan and said, “Did the Manchester City club really issue a blank cheque?”</p>
<p>Evan pulled a check out of a folder and handed it to Twain. He said, “They really give it.” His smile was a little odd, maybe he felt awkward. Allan sat on the side and was silent.</p>
<p>Twain saw that it was really blank on the check. Not a number was on it. It was just waiting for him to play the numbers game. “Are these idiots putting on a show? Are they sincerely coming to us to buy or to show off to us that they have the wealth of an entire nation?”</p>
<p>In fact, Manchester City’s owners did have the wealth of an entire nation—because they were basically the country, the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Despite this fact, Twain would never allow them to show off on purpose, especially in front of him.</p>
<p>Damn, I have to count my pennies this summer while you’re living large. With a flick of your hand, here comes a blank check. Are you mocking me?</p>
<p>Hearing Twain’s complaint, the odd smile on Evan’s face deepened. Twain could be sure his smiled was an awkward one while Allan continued to remain silent.</p>
<p>“What do you think?” Twain had not lost his head to anger yet. He knew the both of them needed to be consulted.</p>
<p>“Tony, we’ve got to listen to you with regards to any deals with the players.” Evan said.</p>
<p>Twain looked at Allan again.</p>
<p>Allan spread his hands and said, “Evan is right. The team is your area of command, Tony.”</p>
<p>“That is to say, I am full responsible for this matter, and you won’t get involved?” Feeling uneasy, Twain asked again.</p>
<p>Evan just laughed and did not reply. Allan raised both his hands and replied, “If you’re worried, we can sign an agreement in black and white…”</p>
<p>Twain interrupted his words and said, “I didn’t mean that, Allan.”</p>
<p>“I mean we really won’t interfere with your work. We all respect every decision you make. After all, you led the team to where it is today.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.” Twain gravely nodded his thanks and said to Allan, “Please help me call the media to Wilford. I’m going to have a press conference… All the media.”</p>
<p>Allan nodded and didn’t ask him what he was going to do at the press conference—any fool would know what he was going to do.</p>
<p>“You can’t let a seemingly thirsty person wait too long. We’ll give them an answer this afternoon.” Twain snickered.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>There was one more thing Twain must do before the press conference. Out of respect for the player’s personal will, he must go and talk to van Nistelrooy to hear his thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy knew of the matter before Twain, who did not believe for a second that Manchester City did not contact him and his agent in private.</p>
<p>The Dutchman’s answer was rather straightforward, which touched Twain. He said, “I did not want to leave here, boss. I hope to retire here if possible.”</p>
<p>“But the Arab’s offer is very tempting, isn’t it?” Twain was not entirely convinced. He was afraid that these were just pretty words for show.</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy laughed, “Actually they also gave me a blank check and said to my agent to fill out whatever amount I want.”</p>
<p>Twain cursed the Arabs for being ruthless in his mind. Imagine how many players could withstand such temptation of any amount of pay package…</p>
<p>F**k you Arab show-offs! So, what if you have oil? Excavate all you want. In a few decades the oil will be finished. I want to see what you can use to act so arrogantly at that time!</p>
<p>Tony Twain from a poor family abused roundly inside. He felt extreme and unbalanced.</p>
<p>“Then you…” Bracing himself, Twain was really worried about van Nistelrooy’s defection.</p>
<p>“I gave it back.” The Dutch striker shrugged.</p>
<p>Twain almost went straight up for a hug.</p>
<p>“I don’t play football to make a lot of money. I’ve made enough money. Right now, … I just want to enjoy football. I like playing here.”</p>
<p>“You’re a good brother and really loyal!” Twain blurted this sentence in Mandarin. Not caring that van Nistelrooy did not understand, he patted the other man hard on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy did not know what the boss had said. He just looked at him laugh and let him pat him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Now that he knew van Nistelrooy’s thoughts on this, Twain had no qualms about what he was about to do—he was not worried about what would happen with Manchester City, but about this affecting his relationship with his player.</p>
<p>After the afternoon training, all the reporters did not go outside the training ground to stop the star players. Instead, they all rushed to the press conference hall of the Wilford training base.</p>
<p>While the leading character had not yet come, there were reporters who speculated as to the purpose behind Twain suddenly taking the initiative to gather everyone to hold a press conference.</p>
<p>There were actually two incidents involving him recently. One matter was his provocation of the Football Association and made them fly into a rage. The other was the “blank check gate” that only recently occurred.</p>
<p>Majority of the reporters chose that it had something to do with the “blank check” because they felt that Twain was not one who would step out for a press conference to do with a ban and a fifteen thousand pounds. Otherwise he would have done so once every few days.</p>
<p>When Twain and Allan Adams appeared at the press conference together, the room gradually quieted down.</p>
<p>Allan sat next to Twain, who stood in front of a pile of microphones. He made a “stop” gesture and said, “I’m not going to take any questions about the situation and will not take too much of everyone’s time.”</p>
<p>He then took a folded piece of paper out of his pocket and unfolded it to show the reporters below the stage.</p>
<p>“This is the blank check that the Manchester City Football Club gave us.” He said, pointing to the piece of paper.</p>
<p>The reporters with good eyesight could see that Twain did not lie to them.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it had something to do with Manchester City, who had been in the limelight lately.</p>
<p>Manchester City used its wealth and offended a number of clubs recently. There were also many people in the media industry who did not like them. Now Manchester City had finally came to Nottingham Forest. One team became arrogant because it suddenly became rich while the other was naturally arrogant… This group decided to watch the show.</p>
<p>“They asked us for van Nistelrooy this morning and gave a completely blank check for us to fill in the numbers. I would like to thank them for their generosity, and I decided to give them an answer in front of all the media as a mark of respect. My reporter friends are my witnesses.”</p>
<p>With that, he took a pen out of his pocket and swept the pile of microphones, cell phones, and recording pens on the table. He leaned down and started to fill in the numbers on the check.</p>
<p>After he lifted the pen and put it down, the whole room suddenly became quiet. The reporters who sat closer, craned their necks to see the numbers Twain had put down.</p>
<p>They only saw Twain’s wrists going in a circle, another circle and yet another circle…</p>
<p>After about thirty seconds, his hand still had not stopped and the room remained silent.</p>
<p>In fact, before coming, Allan did not know what kind of answer Twain would give Manchester City. He was as curious as the reporters below. So, he glanced from the side…</p>
<p>That was when Twain screwed on the pen cap and picked up the check—he was finished.</p>
<p>Following which, he waved to the cameramen at the back and said, “You can come up and shoot. You can’t shoot anything from there, can you?”</p>
<p>A group of reporters carried their equipment and rushed up. They aimed the cameras in their hands and the camera lens at Twain.</p>
<p>Seeing that everyone had come, Twain was satisfied and unveiled the check again to show it to the camera.</p>
<p>“That’s my answer.” He had a brilliant smile on his face.</p>
<p>It was not just the photojournalists who rushed. The other reporters also came up with their notebooks. They were all shocked when they saw the numbers on that check…</p>
<p>9999999999999999999999999999999.</p>
<p>No one could immediately figure out how much this was. To be honest, they might perhaps not be able to calculate how much money this was even if they were give more time. The densely packed Arabic numeral “9” completely filled the blank part and was dizzy to look at, not to mention counting.</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, how … how much is this?” A reporter stammered and asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Twain smiled.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I simply filled it out.” Twain’s smile remained unchanged on his face. “I only stopped when it was all filled up.”</p>
<p>In this way, Twain held his casually filled-in check as he stood in front of the reporters. The flashes were going off like crazy and the room momentarily went bright white. Twain’s eyes could see nothing but white light. However, he kept smiling and held the check.</p>
<p>Sitting next to him, Allan Adams rubbed his temples. He thought he was going crazy, looking at this scene in front of him.</p>
<p>Mark Hughes was in desperate need of a world-class striker to help his new boss achieve his goals. Al Fahim also showed the generosity of being a boss. With the wealth of an entire nation, the rich and overbearing Manchester City Football Club tried to bring in Nottingham Forest’s leading striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy and gave him a blank check. The transfer deal would be a success as long as the Forest team filled in van Nistelrooy’s value on top. Whereas Nottingham Forest had filled in the offer as they had wished but…</p>
<p>If truth be told, the Manchester City Football Club, with its wealth of an entire nation, probably could not afford this sum of money.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 674: Chaos</p>
<p>That evening, the photograph of Twain smiling with the check in his hand appeared on the various major television stations’ sports news and football programs. Even the entertainment talk shows, which had nothing to do with football, excitedly discussed this affair—because this matter was really hilarious.</p>
<p>Most of England was on Twain’s side in this rare instance.</p>
<p>The influx of foreign capital had caused a lot of panic among those who feared the erosion of English football. At this time, it was a coincidence that Tony Twain came out with “Tony Twain’s style” of rejecting Manchester City’s monetary offensive. Although he himself only wanted to protect his players, he could almost be equated as a “national hero” in the eyes of many outsiders…</p>
<p>“… To be honest, I think they (the Arabs) should know what kind of opponent they’ve encountered. It’s not easy to poach a player from Tony Twain.” In the Sky TV’s football news, the news anchor smiled as he critiqued after he reported the news.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The BBC television station conducted street interviews. A bald man clenched his fists and shouted excitedly, “Although I’m not a Nottingham Forest fan, this time I support Tony Twain and his team! Can’t allow the Arabs to think that they can act without the slightest scruple because they have money! Keep fighting, Forest! Oh yeah!”</p>
<p>After the excited fan left, the reporter spoke to the microphone and said to the camera, “Obviously, he is not a Manchester City fan.”</p>
<p>“Well, thank you, Vincent. Maybe he’s a Manchester United fan.” The host said after the footage cut back live to the studio.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>On a late-night talk show, the invited female star thrusted up her generous bosom and said to the host with a laugh, “Ah, I think I’m a little obsessed with the lovely Tony. He’s so manly! I don’t mind having a one-night stand with him… I hear he doesn’t have a girlfriend?”</p>
<p>The host pretended to make a face and said, “Aren’t you afraid that he’s gay?”</p>
<p>The female star’s eyes sparkled, and she smiled happily, “I don’t mind at all! And I think it’s going to be more thrilling!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The BBC 5’s correspondent and the reporter, Spicer from The Daily Telegraph was producing a book called [The mysterious aura of Tony Twain—the man he is]. He said through the telephone on the live show to everyone who followed this incident closely, “This is not just a football event. I’d rather call it a social phenomenon! My [The mysterious aura of Tony Twain—the man he is] is about to be finished! At that time, I believe you can learn some of the reasons. Frankly speaking he is such a person!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The Sky TV’s website message board was even livelier. There was less constraint here than on the television media, so it seemed a little confusing. Those people who supported Tony Twain were in the majority, and the opposition party was almost all Manchester City fans.</p>
<p>“Let him die! Who does he think he is? This clown, Tony Twain is the bastard resulting from me screwing around with his mother. Wah haha haha—”</p>
<p>“Poor man, another idiot driven mad by Tony…”</p>
<p>“You damn moron, why did your father not flush you down the toilet when you were born?”</p>
<p>“Don’t mind him. Leave him be.”</p>
<p>“Tony Twain keep fighting! We are all your supporters!”</p>
<p>“Why should we support an upstart like Nottingham Forest? A hooligan has become your idol. I really feel sad for the British people!”</p>
<p>“You’re not qualified to say that, you Manchester City upstart asshole!”</p>
<p>“You Manchester City idiot, who are you calling an upstart? Come to Stamford Bridge if you dare. I’ll show you a thing or two!”</p>
<p>“We, Manchester United fans have announced that there is only one team in Manchester, and that is Manchester United! Oh yeah, oh yeah—Oh yeah!”</p>
<p>“Get out of the way, you red devils! Don’t you know who the first owner in Manchester was! Blue is the main color of English football!”</p>
<p>“F**K! Are you completely ignoring the existence of Liverpool? I tell you; we’ve won the most championship titles in England! Blue is shit!”</p>
<p>“Anfield bastards, don’t think that just because we Everton fans are away, you can be full of shit!”</p>
<p>“Manchester City are stupid c**ts, can’t even be compared to Arsenal…”</p>
<p>“White Hart Lane bastards don’t lump the Gunners together with idiots like Manchester City. We’re better than them!”</p>
<p>“Damn it, we’ll show you Gunners in the next North London derby!”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>It was really chaotic and indeed the first mess in history.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>And the main character who caused this chaos was at home, with his legs crossed and holding a cup of tea, talking to Shania on the phone.</p>
<p>“Uncle Tony, you’re making headlines again!”</p>
<p>“How so? Does the American side cares about the Premier League too? They all don’t watch soccer, do they?”</p>
<p>“I checked online!”</p>
<p>“The Internet is so annoying. Can’t even pretend to be a good guy…” Twain did not even watch his mouth and teased Shania who could not see him. He found that during this time, as long as it was a phone call with Shania, he could not act serious. He initially wanted to seriously ask her about her study and career, but all he could say became jokes. Perhaps it was because they had not seen each other for too long. He really miss her…</p>
<p>Sure enough, Shania giggled and said, “But I like to see you pretend to be a good guy, Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>“Why?” Twain did not understand. There was nothing to like about pretending to be a good guy.</p>
<p>“Because it’s cute!”</p>
<p>A huge bead of sweat dripped from Twain’s forehead. Was an uncle who was close to fort years old in biological age, still cute? He thought about it and felt a chill down his spine.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shania. Don’t use the word ‘cute’ to describe an old man in the future. I’m covered in goosebumps.”</p>
<p>Shania chuckled even more happily.</p>
<p>But he really felt good to be able to cheer up Shania who was alone in the United States. Not to mention that he would be a cute middle-aged uncle, even if he were to be a clown, Twain would do so too.</p>
<p>There was a strange feeling growing in Twain’s heart. He liked to hear Shania silvery bell-like laughter. He felt that if he could make Shania happy every day, it would be a great achievement. He would never forgive whoever made Shania unhappy. And whoever get any ideas about this lovely fairy, he would also never … he did not seem to have any right. She was not even his own daughter… But I can keep her safe. Those guys whom I don’t think are good enough for her cannot approach Shania within five square miles!</p>
<p>After laughing happily, the two people then fell in a silence.</p>
<p>Twain could even clearly hear her gasps coming from the other end of the phone. Perhaps she had laughed too long. He could even imagine that Shania must be red in her face with a fine bead of sweat on her forehead. The gasps continued, and it became clearer, as if Shania herself had put her lips next to Twain’s ear.</p>
<p>Twain felt a little itchy in his ear…</p>
<p>“Is your work difficult, Shania?” In order to get out of this awkward situation, he spoked first and asked.</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s hard. Sometimes I feel like I’m too busy.” Shania pursed her lips and said. “I feel like giving myself a year off!” She stretched her back and said loudly.</p>
<p>As she grew more famous and had made more new friends in Hollywood, her career gradually expanded. It was normal to be busy.</p>
<p>Twain smiled and thought that even though Shania was eighteen years old, she was still like a child psychologically. “If you want to take a year off, would Mr. Fasal cry?”</p>
<p>“Hee-hee. I can only tell you this. Mr. Fasal is getting stricter.” Shania stuck out her tongue.</p>
<p>Twain suddenly thought of something. “How about your parents? Did you stay in contact?” When he found that they were together, Shania rarely took the initiative to mention her family. Even if her concept of family was indifferent, she should not be like this. Not to mention he heard that Brazilians were not like the British, their sense of family was actually very strong.</p>
<p>“Yes, they came to L.A. some time ago to spend a few days with me. But they’re all busy. I’m been used to it since as long as I can remember. By the way, they asked about you.”</p>
<p>“Asked about me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, they heard you went to China and Japan, and asked by the way, seeing that you are also busy …”</p>
<p>Twain scratched his head and said, “If I can, I really want to put myself on leave for a year too…”</p>
<p>He finished his sentence only to find that he and Shania had said the same thing and heard Shani’s delighted laughter in amazement.</p>
<p>“If you take a year off, it would not be one person who would be crying, would it? Well, Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>“Well, can’t always fulfill beautiful wishes. Ah, the reality is so cruel, and society is so harsh…”</p>
<p>After he chatted with Shania for a while more, he eventually hung up. Both of them were a little tired from working every day. They were tense from being public figures all day long and could only be themselves for so little time at night at home.</p>
<p>Lying in bed and staring at the ceiling, his eyes gradually adapted to the darkness in the bedroom. He was not thinking about how to deal with more reporters coming in tomorrow, or what would happen after his fight to death with Manchester City. He suddenly recalled Shania’s gasps over the phone.</p>
<p>In addition to the clear gasps in his mind, there was only the slightly open and moist red lips. The small and lovely tongue hidden behind the pearl white teeth gently poked its tip out, as if a budding lotus had just exposed its sharp tips.</p>
<p>Uncle Tony….</p>
<p>Twain suddenly sat up from the bed. He got off the bed, bent his waist and ran into the bathroom. He remembered that he had cared about talking to Shania over the phone just now and forgot to empty his bladder for his survival… Soon, the sound of peeing into the toilet could be heard.</p>
<p>Once he came out of the bathroom, he passed by Shania’s room, stood at the door and looked inside for a moment. The décor was exactly the same as when Shania was there. The family of Totoro soft toys sat on Shania’s bed and became temporary tenants.</p>
<p>Looking at these charmingly naïve and furry soft toys with their different expressions, Twain laughed as he leaned against the door frame.</p>
<p>The eighteen-year-old supermodel and Hollywood’s new star with countless fans around the world, Judy Shania Jordana was considered the star with a boundless future but she was still a little girl who could not sleep at night without holding anything.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The next day, outside the gates of Wilford, Twain and Dunn came together. They could see the crowd of people swarming around there. They knew who those people were and why they were here.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I’m not surprised at all.” Twain raised his head and said off-handedly.</p>
<p>“Truthfully, I will be shocked if you’re surprised.” Dunn deadpanned and make sarcastic remark next to him.</p>
<p>“Hanging out with the beautiful female reporter has made you more eloquent, Dunn…” Twain gave his partner a sideways glance.</p>
<p>An occasional glib repartee was good for the physical and mental health.</p>
<p>“Hi, good morning…Yo, Mr. 007, how early did you come here? There’s dew on your hair…” Twain skillfully greeted the reporters and did not forget to make a joke or two with the people he had a better relationship with.</p>
<p>“That’s perspiration, Tony…” Pierce Brosnan smiled awkwardly, and reached up to wipe the sweat on his forehead.</p>
<p>Twain signaled for Dunn to enter first. Then he stood at the gate and turned to ask, “What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>He did not want to bring this mess to the training ground. He wanted to settle it here, and not let a single reporter enter.</p>
<p>“Do you know the the Manchester City club’s latest response?” Someone asked aloud among the reporters.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Manchester City’s chief operating officer, Paul Aldridge has made a statement to hit back at your performance at yesterday’s press conference. He thinks you’re a circus clown, putting on a show.”</p>
<p>“He’s not the first person to say that about me. Doesn’t matter. They wanted to buy our player and we sincerely gave a price. If they can’t afford to pay, just come out and say they can’t afford to pay. We can also announce the end of the transfer deal. I don’t know how this personal attack came about.” Twain spread his hands with an innocent face. But the reporters knew that if he were really innocent, there would be no bad guys in the world.</p>
<p>If they were aware of such a Chinese saying— lead the life of a whore and expect a monument built for one’s chastity, and understood what it meant, they would have given it to Tony Twain. Because in their view, Twain was the kind of person who was like a whore that wanted a chastity monument…</p>
<p>“But, Mr. Twain. You don’t think this offer is a little like…”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s not enough?” Twain asked which shocked the reporter to quickly wave his hands. Who would dare to think it was not enough with so many “9s”? They could not even count the figure!</p>
<p>“I mean to say…a little like daylight robbery.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.” The expression on Twain’s face looked even more innocent. “The Manchester City owner told us very sincerely to fill in the check as we like. He didn’t state the amount that we couldn’t fill in, nor did he set a limit for the lowest or highest. Hence I sincerely met the other party’s sincere request. I don’t think we’ve done anything wrong on both sides. So, I don’t understand what the chief operating officer is angry about… Don’t tell me the money is coming out of his own pocket? Oh, then he’s such a poor thing in that case…” Twain raised his eyebrows and sighed.</p>
<p>Some of the reporters laughed.</p>
<p>This time, most of the media stood on the side of Tony Twain. Many of the actions of the Manchester City club since the change of ownership had angered many in this circle, but they had not had the opportunity or excuse to express their dissatisfaction. If they deliberately picked fault with them, it might give the other party information that could be used against them. Now that Manchester City had provoked Nottingham Forest, there would be a good show.</p>
<p>“If the Manchester City club makes a public statement that they have never sent us a blank check and have never said those words ‘fill in the figure you want’, then everything was hyped up by me using the name of the new Manchester City boss. In that case, I can hold another press conference and publicly apologize to the Manchester City Football club as a whole. The sincerest apology and no objections from me!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Manchester City certainly could not lick back its sprayed spittle. That would be too disgusting…</p>
<p>The real reason was that the pervasive news media had already brought to live the description they wrote about their image as obscenely wealthy and squandering money around—furthermore, it was what they wanted to see most initially. They hoped to attract the world’s top players to play for them in this way.</p>
<p>As a result, now that they were checkmated by Twain, they had no way to refute.</p>
<p>Twain won in another clash between Nottingham Forest and Manchester City. He finally got his dignity back that he had lost on Richards.</p>
<p>Manchester City suffered a loss and had to suffer in silence. But did that mean they had no way of dealing with Tony Twain?</p>
<p>No, they had many ways.</p>
<p>Today’s Nottingham Forest might be a delicious cheesecake, 82 Lafite, scrumptious French banquet, scantily clad beautiful woman in the eyes of these big shots … The more resistance they put up, the more it aroused the desire of the strong party to conquer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 675: The Imposing Manner of The Strong</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy was also harassed. As he was surrounded by many reporters running after him, he repeatedly voiced his stance. “I’m not leaving Nottingham Forest. I’m very happy with everything here, and I want to play here until I retire if possible.”</p>
<p>The owner refused to sell and the player refused to come. What else was there to talk about?</p>
<p>The Manchester City club subsequently announced that they were no longer interested in van Nistelrooy.</p>
<p>Twain was able to take delight in fighting Manchester City after clarifying another matter — van der Vaart was fine.</p>
<p>In the first round of the league tournament, van der Vaart left the game with an injury in the opening ten minutes. Twain was very worried. After the game ended, the results of the hospital examination allowed him to breathe a sigh of relief. He would recover after a two-week rest since he did not injure any muscles or bones. Twain originally thought he needed at least four months to recover.</p>
<p>If that had not happened, Twain might not be in the mood to play with Manchester City. He would have rejected the offer.</p>
<p>The media and spectators in England would not have enjoyed such a good show the past two days.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>A lot of interesting things happened. The English fans found that as long as Tony Twain was around, they would never feel that time was slow. Everyone relished watching him shooting off his big mouth at the post-match press conference, and the head-on clash with Manchester City and the United Arab Emirates consortium behind it.</p>
<p>Just before the dust settled on those stories, the second round of the Premier League began.</p>
<p>In the second round of the league tournament, Nottingham Forest continued their away trip and headed to Kingston upon Hull in Yorkshire, where they would meet a new rival, Hull City.</p>
<p>The 104-year-old team was competing in England’s top tier football League for the first time. Before, they were more famous for their rugby. The team’s home stadium, KCOM Stadium, was both a football pitch and an international rugby stadium.</p>
<p>Since Twain was banned by the English Football Association for one match, he was only allowed to watch the game from the stands, the command handed over to his two assistant managers, who would be in charge of the on-field adjustments. The Football Association was also aware that Tony Twain was not someone who would just sit quietly, so they sent security to flank Twain. They would sit beside him during the game to prevent him from using advanced communication tools to contact the coaches.</p>
<p>When Twain gave the team the specific tactics in the locker room, he was delighted to see the two black-clad men waiting at the door. “It’s been a long time, you two.”</p>
<p>The two people had overseen him during the time he was banned from the English Football League Championship.</p>
<p>They were familiar as well. The two smiled. “We often see you, Mr. Twain.”</p>
<p>Although they were no strangers, they were not friends who would chat together, so Twain did not talk nonsense and just pointed to the grandstand to say, “let’s go.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the stands, Twain was a lot more honest than their first encounter. He did not get any devious ideas and did not ask to change seats. He did not have any intention of contacting below. He was like an ordinary fan as he held a cup of beer and sat in the stands to watch the game. If the Forest team did well, he would clap and cheer like any other Forest fans. If Hull City had the upper hand, he would scold and boo as well.</p>
<p>As the two men watched his behavior, they did not know whether to cry or laugh.</p>
<p>Were there any managers who were like him?</p>
<p>Twain’s thinking was very simple. Since he obviously could not direct the game in the stands, he would watch the game like a fan. The experience was invaluable to him.</p>
<p>Hull City was a newly promoted team and they were considered to be the top promoted favorite of the season. It took only five years for the team to move from the lowest level in the English professional league to the top. They ranked third in England. They could not be underestimated.</p>
<p>In the first round of the league tournament, Hull City won 2:1 against Fulham, and the entire city was jubilant. They were equally in high spirits for this game. If they did not handle them carefully, the UEFA Champions League winner and last season’s Double Winner would suffer a defeat.</p>
<p>Hull City’s manager was Phil Brown. Twain was a little unfamiliar with Hull City, but he was not unfamiliar with Brown. The man, who was once Allardyce’s assistant manager, had spent seven years at Bolton Wanderers, from which his tactical preferences were evident.</p>
<p>The Bolton Wanderers achieved success in the Premier League by relying on strength to compete, which Brown was well-versed in. According to the team’s new player George Boateng, the team began a lot of physical training before the season and would be pitting strength against the Premier League strong teams. And Boateng happened to be such a player. The team captain, Ashbee was even more loved by the fans for being aggressive on the pitch. In addition, the game’s starting center-back, Turner was more than 1.90 meters tall, and Gardner, on loan, was equally strong.</p>
<p>Judging from the lineup, it was clear what tactics Hull City would use in this game:high balls and aerial shots in English traditional football and physical confrontational style of competition.</p>
<p>The natural enemy of a technical team was such a team. Remember the “Crazy Gang” Wimbledon that was brilliant for a while in the 1980s? The European champion, Liverpool had to bow before them at home.</p>
<p>Sadly for them, Nottingham Forest was not Liverpool, and they had never based their pride on their skills. In terms of strength, fighting spirit, and drive, Nottingham Forest would not lose to this newly promoted team.</p>
<p>Before the game, to counter the characteristics of the opponent, Twain’s arranged tactics in the midfield to meet force with force, and then rely on incisive attacks from the sides to gain the key.</p>
<p>And, like most newly promoted teams, Hull City’s focus in the summer transfer window had been on their offense rather than defense. Not because their defense was strong enough, but because their offense was worse. Consequently, most of the people brought in during the transfer window were attacking players. As for their defense, they still played the old set of coordination from the English Football League Championship.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, in the manager’s opinion, offense could be adjusted at will, but the defense had to be steady. Unless they had to, they would rather trust old players who already understand than new players who might be capable.</p>
<p>Twain seized on that and gave up the defensive counterattack routine. Nottingham Forest launched a full-scale attack at the start of the away game, putting a lot of pressure on Hull City both on the sides and in the middle.</p>
<p>He did not believe that an English Football League Championship level of defense could withstand the attacking line of a Champions League level team.</p>
<p>The facts were as he thought. Hull City wanted to compete against the Forest team at home, using physical strength but lost four minutes later. Van Nistelrooy, who was in the spotlight because of the clash between Manchester City and Forest, was onside and successfully scored the opening goal. The KCOM Stadium was silent. The physically strong defenders were still a little tender when they came up against the experienced striker.</p>
<p>The goal that was scored so early in the game completely interrupted Phil Brown’s deployment and upset the mood of Hull City players.</p>
<p>They beat Fulham in the first round and thought they could make a good start in the Premier League, so they arrogantly wanted to defeat Nottingham Forest at home — Manager Brown’s reason was that the strong Nottingham Forest team would underestimate a newly promoted team.</p>
<p>But he did not know that Twain paid more attention to a newly promoted team. It was related to his own experience, and he never let go of a great opportunity to earn points and gain on the goal difference from a newly promoted team.</p>
<p>The poor Hull City rushed to organize a counterattack, but when they faced the two defensive lines led by George Wood, they could not gain an upper hand physically and they lacked skills and experience. Their circumstances immediately declined.</p>
<p>Eight minutes after the last goal, Nottingham Forest scored another goal. The goal was scored by Eastwood, whose sudden long shot at the top of the penalty area arc was perfectly aligned with his style. The football ball arced straight into the far corner of the goal. And it was 2:0!</p>
<p>The Forest team slowed down its pace a little after the two-goal lead. Hull City gradually strengthened and began to try to fight back.</p>
<p>The two sides were entangled on the pitch. Hull City had two excellent chances, but one was timely pounced on by van der Sar while Pepe lifted the siege for the other when he went head to head with the opposing striker.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest also had a sure-shot chance. Ribéry’s shot bounced off the post and Lennon, who followed up, tried to make up for it but it was kicked away by the opposing captain, Ashbee.</p>
<p>As van der Vaart could not play due to his injury, Twain put Beckham in the middle to partner with George Wood. The focus is on the sides with the middle as support. Because Beckham had some defensive ability, George Wood was instructed to plug in and actively participate in the offense to try to put more pressure on the opponent.</p>
<p>After scoring two goals in the first half, neither side scored again. The score was 2:0, with Nottingham Forest in the lead.</p>
<p>During halftime, Twain got up and smiled at the two men. “Did the FA say not to let me go into the locker room at halftime?”</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other, and one of them said alertly, “you can’t go into the home team’s locker room.”</p>
<p>Twain laughed happily. “I’m not that stupid.”</p>
<p>Then he turned his head around and walked down.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At halftime, Twain instructed the team not to be satisfied with the two-goal lead. He found the Forest team a little too relaxed in the second part of the first half and Hull City’s threatening shots against the goal happened during that period. If he were on the sidelines to direct the game, he would have roared to call them to attention using his loud voice.</p>
<p>“It’s right to adjust your rhythm, but you can’t relax all the way. If we face Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea, or Liverpool, I can’t say if we will still have the two-goal advantage. In the second half, if there’s a chance to score, don’t let it go. Remember you’ll be judged if you waste an opportunity!”</p>
<p>“What is the judgement?” someone on the team asked.</p>
<p>“It’s punishment.” Twain answered his question with a grim expression.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The Forest team picked up its pace in the second half. Hull City, who had wanted to use the time to counterattack, was pressed within its own half of the pitch. They were so pathetic that they could not even make a shot.</p>
<p>In the 62nd and 67th minutes, van Nistelrooy completed his first hat-trick of the season. Nottingham Forest’s top scorer scored two goals within five minutes to turn the score into 4:0.</p>
<p>Hull City, nicknamed the “Tigers,” completely lost their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Facing the Nottingham Forest team, whose strength surpassed theirs in more ways than one and treated the game more seriously, Phil Brown could only stand helplessly on the sidelines, unable to turn around a hopeless situation — he did not think that Tony Twain’s hunger for victory was so ravenous that he would not even let go of a newly promoted team… That was incorrect. No one wanted to lose. But the competitive attitude, which still relentlessly pursued goals despite the two-goal lead, gave Brown the chills on the sidelines. Nottingham Forest was now four goals ahead, but Brown saw that they had no intention of giving up and still relentlessly sought every chance to score a goal.</p>
<p>Brown felt as if a boulder was pressing down on him, making him breathless.</p>
<p>Was this the true face of Nottingham Forest, the miraculous team that swept through Europe in the last three seasons…</p>
<p>The obsessive pursuit of goals, victories, championship titles had created this invincible steely force.</p>
<p>He routinely glanced at the away team’s technical area, wanting to get a closer look at the manager, who had a great deal of rumors around him. However, looking at the empty seat in the technical area, he froze momentarily before reacting — Tony Twain was banned again.</p>
<p>What an elusive opponent…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the 88th minute, everyone thought the game would end with this score, but Nottingham Forest scored again as Hull City struggled in the final moments to score a goal to save face.</p>
<p>It was Beckham with his iconic free kick. Hull City’s contributor to its promotion and last season’s English Football League Championship’s top goalkeeper, Boaz Myhill, stood in place and did not move when the football spun into the goal.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest swept Hull City by 5:0 to win two games in a row in the new season!</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest decisively won 5-0 in the away game.</p>
<p>After the last round of the league tournament ended, some columnists still criticized Nottingham Forest’s performance and thought the start of their league tournament would be very difficult. Twain’s team gave them a hard slap in the face with their actions in this round of the league tournament.</p>
<p>After the game, Phil Brown lamented that it was the gap in ability — “We did our best, but unfortunately Nottingham Forest did its best.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Two rounds later, Nottingham Forest was at the top of the league with two straight wins. They relied on their advantage in the goal difference to surpass Chelsea and Liverpool, which had also had two straight wins.</p>
<p>What interested Twain was Chelsea’s performance after the arrival of its new manager, Scolari. It looked like despite Mourinho’s departure, Chelsea would continue to be his best rival.</p>
<p>The day after they returned to Nottingham Forest, Twain received a fax. As the Double Winner last season, it was normal for the players on the team to receive interest from the other teams. He had received countless similar faxes this summer.</p>
<p>But it was different.</p>
<p>This fax was from the Manchester City Football Club.</p>
<p>They were not going to keep pestering van Nistelrooy.</p>
<p>This time, they changed their target.</p>
<p>That player was… Nicklas Bendtner.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 676 - Bendtner’s Ambition</p>
<p>The outside news media heard about Manchester City’s desire to acquire Nottingham Forest’s number two center forward, Nicklas Bendtner, almost exactly at the same time Twain saw the piece of news on his desk. It was clear that the Manchester City club deliberately revealed it to the outside world.</p>
<p>Just like how Tony Twain was close to [Nottingham Evening Post], the Manchester City club must have been on close terms with one or two media, which could speak up on their behalf during key moments. Their reward would be to know “the insider story” earlier than any other media.</p>
<p>Twain was in a daze as he held the Manchester City club’s offer.</p>
<p>There had been news of some clubs interested in Bendtner in previous seasons, but none had come true. On the one hand, Twain would not sell his team’s future number one center forward; on the other, Bendtner’s father, who was also his spokesman, had announced more than once that his son would not leave the Forest team.</p>
<p>In that case, would it still be the same result this time?</p>
<p>He decided to wait a day and see.</p>
<p>One day should be enough for Thomas Bendtner to response?</p>
<p>Hence he stuffed the fax from Manchester City under a pile of folders.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>A day later, there was more and more news in the media about Manchester City’s desire to bring in Bendtner, which was reprinted by the local media in Nottingham.</p>
<p>Bendtner’s father, Thomas Bendtner, was still unresponsive.</p>
<p>That was when Twain sensed danger in the air.</p>
<p>The reporters flocked to the Wilford training base, wanting to hear what Bendtner himself thought of the “rumors.”</p>
<p>But Bendtner remained silent and did not answer any questions from any reporter.</p>
<p>Bendtner was a slightly uncommunicative young man in the team, unlike Eastwood and Ribéry. Even so, his popularity was good. His silence was different from that of Anelka’s. Anelka was a loner, while the Danish handsome guy was just a little introverted.</p>
<p>But not saying a word was a problem.</p>
<p>Twain felt he should call Bendtner’s agent. He did not believe the Manchester City club would follow the rules, which were to approach the club first before they made contact with the player. The other side must have contacted the player’s agent before they made an offer to the Forest team. They learned their lesson from their experience with van Nistelrooy. At that time, Manchester City failed because they did not made clear inquiries about van Nistelrooy’s wishes.</p>
<p>Bendtner had two agents. One was his father, Thomas Bendtner, who was more like a spokesman. Bendtner conveyed any ideas he had through his father. He was not involved in the contract negotiations with the team and other work. But he was indeed the most important figure who could not be ignored, because his son depended on him to make decisions.</p>
<p>The other agent was Nicola Juric. He was a regular broker with a FIFA issued license. He carried out all the contact with the team.</p>
<p>Twain decided to call Juric first because the two of them dealt with each other more often than he did with Bendtner’s father.</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, I know you called me for.” Juric spoke right to the point as he was a smart man. He did not waste time with Twain. He did not even wait for Twain to ask him. He revealed everything, “The Manchester City people came to me, hoping to know the possibility of Bendtner’s transfer. I told them it was very difficult, because Mr. Twain certainly wouldn’t let him go. But they said it didn’t matter. They just wanted to know what Bendtner himself thought. As long as he wants to, then…”</p>
<p>“Very good.” Twain nodded. The problem was simple. “What does Bendtner think?”</p>
<p>Juric smiled over the phone, “You can’t ask me this, Mr. Twain.”</p>
<p>Twain paused for a second before he reacted—if he wanted to know what Bendtner thought, he had to ask his father. Bendtner’s thoughts were conveyed through his father’s mouth to others.</p>
<p>Hanging up, Twain did not hurry to call Thomas. He wanted to straighten things out first.</p>
<p>It was clear that Manchester City lacked strikers. They were short since the start of last season to this season. Last season, Manchester City had so many strikers but not one of them score double-digit goals during the season! It could even be said to be an extraordinary shame and humiliation for a team’s forwards. In other words, after the new boss came to power, they tried to plunder strikers worldwide and messed up other teams’ transfer deals was not because they wanted to make enemies everywhere and definitely not to put on a show. It was because they were compelled by circumstances… As a result, Berbatov, Adebayor, Drogba and van Nistelrooy did not take up Manchester City’s offers at all and did not even consider this upstart at all.</p>
<p>Since the world’s top strikers were unwilling to “condescend”, then it made sense for Manchester City to have no choice but to…</p>
<p>The problem is, this is the second time they are at my, Tony Twain’s door again!</p>
<p>Nicklas Bendtner is my anointed future number one center forward. Manchester City, you have a big appetite…</p>
<p>After thinking things through, Twain then realized that he had been at loggerheads with Manchester City this summer.</p>
<p>First, they parted on bad terms due to Richards. Following which, because of van Nistelrooy, Twain aggravated the situation and caused a din, which put Manchester City in an awkward situation. Now the other side specifically came for Bendtner. What did that mean? Did they want to get back at me?</p>
<p>No way!</p>
<p>Twain picked up his cell phone to find the number for Bendtner’s father, Thomas, and dialed it.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The Forest players came to the training base in succession to get ready for the day’s training.</p>
<p>Every summer, the “transfer rumors” would be discussed in the locker room. Outside, the reporters and fans racked their brains to find out the story behind every transfer rumor and the related inside story. But in here, these could be used as jokes in discussion.</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy was the focus of much debate and butt of jokes some time ago. The boss’s actions at the press conference also made everyone happy for a long time. Now it was Bendtner’s turn.</p>
<p>“Hey, do you want to guess how the boss will reject Manchester City again?” Wes Morgan, who was naked, bounced around in the locker room while changing his clothes.</p>
<p>Everyone turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“Burn the check?” Bale said.</p>
<p>“I heard there was no blank check this time.” It was Baines who answered him.</p>
<p>“Well…” Eastwood knitted his brows and said, “A direct rejection is not fun…”</p>
<p>Bendtner listened to people talking about things related to him, but he quietly changed clothes at the side. When Wes Morgan was still swinging his dick around in the locker room, he began to sit down and tie his shoelaces.</p>
<p>At last someone remembered that the person involved was by his side. Lennon’s locker was on Bendtner’s right, and the two were next to each other. He patted the back of Bendtner who bent over to tie his shoelaces and asked, “Nick, did they look for you?</p>
<p>Bendtner did not look up and continued to tie his shoelaces as he said, “No.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Mr. Tony Twain, I don’t want to lie to you. Actually, they did look for me.” Thomas Bendtner answered Twain’s question on the phone.</p>
<p>It was not unexpected at all. Twain’s expression did not even change. He continued to ask, “I’m not going to ask you exactly what you discussed about. I just want to know what Bendtner’s thoughts are on this.”</p>
<p>To fight back against Manchester City, he naturally had to know what Bendtner himself thought. In this way, he would have his targeted countermeasure to deal with the situation like how he dealt with van Nistelrooy.</p>
<p>Twain thought he’d hear things like “He doesn’t want to leave”, like what his father had said in response to the previous rumors. He did not expect this time he would hear Thomas said clearly, “He wants to leave.”</p>
<p>“That’s good…” Twain’s brain had not register for a while and just reflexively spoke before he realized something was amiss. He hurriedly corrected himself, “No, I mean … What? Leave?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Twain. I don’t want to lie to you, so I have to tell the truth. My son, Nicklas Bendtner, wants to leave Nottingham Forest.”</p>
<p>Twain froze for a while and found that his brain was a little out of order. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“My son often complains that he cannot obtain an important position in the team, Mr. Twain. He wants to go to a team that can give him a main core position. As luck would have it, Manchester City have agreed to all his terms.”</p>
<p>Twain felt cold all over. He never thought it would be like this. The future main center forward whom he always regarded highly, placed unlimited hopes on, spent several years of hard work on, actually felt he was not put in an important position in the team, and wanted to leave!</p>
<p>I’m hearing things, right?</p>
<p>Or I haven’t woken up yet?</p>
<p>Or has Thomas the old man not woken up yet, and his mind was confused from a fever yesterday?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The locker room was very lively since the boss had not appeared on the training ground anyway. There was still time before the training would start. Everyone did not mind staying here to talk about private topics. For example, they continued to guess what their boss would do to Manchester City.</p>
<p>Lennon was still chatting with Bendtner. This time, he half-jokingly asked, “You’re not leaving, are you Nick? I heard that Manchester City is very rich and can give you a very high salary.”</p>
<p>Bendtner shook his head and said, “I don’t care how high the salary is.”</p>
<p>Lennon smiled.</p>
<p>“I just want to play the main position.” Having said that, he got up and went straight out of the noisy locker room.</p>
<p>Lennon watched his back disappear behind the door in puzzlement.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“How can he not be put in an important position? He played twenty-seven games last season! Almost half the number of games. He’s my second center forward. Doesn’t that clarify the issue?” Twain was a little agitated because he felt that Thomas’s reason was bullshit and insufficient. He had a lot of data to overturn this “not been put in an important position” excuse. “He scored ten goals and had eight assists! With such excellent data, if he were to be at Arsenal, perhaps he might not get it at all!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, that’s the problem. You say he is the second center forward. My son, he wants to be the number one center forward. And I too think he has the ability.”</p>
<p>It turned out that he was not willing to be van Nistelrooy’s substitute. “Van Nistelrooy has more experience than he has. Moreover, according to my plan, he will officially replace the Dutchman as the number one center forward, come one more season!” That being the case, Twain was confident of making Bendtner stay.</p>
<p>“No. My son is too impatient to wait. Mr. Twain, do you still remember what you said to him when you first met Nicklas?”</p>
<p>That remark stopped Twain. How could he remember so clearly what happened four years ago?</p>
<p>Seeing that Twain did not answer, Thomas chuckled. This sound made Twain frown, and he suddenly felt incensed.</p>
<p>“You see, you don’t remember, Mr. Twain. In order to have my son refused to go to Arsenal at that time and come to your team, you promised that he would be the main player and the core of the forward line. Am I wrong in saying that? Or maybe you were just casually saying it. I can understand. After all, in order to attract players to play for the team now, you managers always have to write blank checks and make promises that are impossible to fulfill. But my son always remembers these words. He came to the Forest team and trained hard to compete, working towards that goal…”</p>
<p>“Mr. Thomas Bendtner…”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that four years on, after Viduka had gone, came van Nistelrooy. You said next season belongs to Nicklas? To be honest, I’m doubtful. My son is a nice young man who always trusts others easily. But I’m not a twenty-year-old kid. I’m older than you, Mr. Twain. I know this is just an excuse for you to buy time. When the Dutchman can’t play, you’re going to find another center forward from the transfer market, right? With so many good center forwards now, I don’t want my son to be a lifelong substitute. I never doubted my son’s ability, but I doubt you can give him the chance to play to his full potential. Nicklas can be the best striker in the world, provided he doesn’t play as a substitute for someone else at Forest. You want to keep him; I would never agree.”</p>
<p>With the other man said so much in one breath, Twain’s brain gradually calmed down. He asked, “Have you finished? Mr. Thomas Bendtner?”</p>
<p>“I have said all there are to say, Mr. Twain. I know you like people to be honest with you, so I’m being frank.”</p>
<p>Twain took a deep breath, and then slowly spoke the words, “Thank you for your honesty. I think I need to consider everything you said.”</p>
<p>“When you’ve thought about it, you’re welcome to give me a call.”</p>
<p>This time Twain did not throw the phone. He hung up and sat alone on the chair in a daze.</p>
<p>He knew that he sometimes deliberately suppressed Bendtner’s desire, but that was due to his worry that he would become too proud. He was aware of what kind of person Bendtner was. This talented young man was proud and arrogant. Sometimes he had his eyes above his head. He did not want a genius with talent and a great future to end up average due to some psychological and character issues. So, he tried to create a less-than-smooth environment for Bendtner and never told him what he really thought. He wanted Bendtner to be able to experience it for himself.</p>
<p>The Chinese’s reservation and the English’s reservation were all embodied within the fake Caucasian body of Tony Twain.</p>
<p>He did not want to lay it all bare because he felt that would lose the meaning of experience and growth. Now it seemed that he was wrong.</p>
<p>Bendtner was not the kind of patient person who was willing to experience growth. His thinking was typically Western—since I have such a great foundation, environment and conditions, why do I have to go through some shitty growth? Why can’t I be the main core right away? I have the ability, so I want it!</p>
<p>Twain felt like it was all wishful thinking on his part before…</p>
<p>I’ve spent so much efforts and hard work to focus on the development of this striker only to have him think that he has not been put to an important use.</p>
<p>It was a great irony for Twain, who liked to control everything with his own hands.</p>
<p>He leaned back on the back of his chair and looked out of the window at the sunny training ground, where Bendtner and his teammates appeared on the field one by one.</p>
<p>He really wanted to know what Bendtner was feeling at the moment.</p>
<p>You think you’ve been deceived?</p>
<p>I feel cheated instead!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 677: To Part on Bad Terms</p>
<p>Twain felt that he had been deceived, not that he had been deceived by others, but by his own wishful thinking. He had actually thought that all his players were obedient and well-behaved kids like the data in the FM game, which had no meaning other than a name.</p>
<p>It seemed that the impact of the transmigration had not completely disappeared…</p>
<p>Sometimes he really took this as a Football Manager game and play.</p>
<p>But Bendtner gave him a hard slap, which told him that this was the real world, so realistic that anyone in the team could break away from his control and pursue the future he wanted. Ribéry was a wake-up call, and Bendtner was soon to be a reality.</p>
<p>But Twain did not plan to let Bendtner go like that.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was to sell to Manchester City.</p>
<p>The day after that phone call with Bendtner’s father, Twain turned down Manchester City’s offer of eighteen million pounds during an interview.</p>
<p>“Bendtner is the future of our team and we won’t be foolish enough to give him to other clubs.” His tone was tough as if there was no room for discussion.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The car park in Wilford was getting crowded, with the various latest models of cars filling up the lots—the Nottingham Forest star players came for training in succession.</p>
<p>Bendtner sat in his black Volkswagen and was not in a hurry to get out of the car. Empty cars parked around him as their owners were already in the locker room.</p>
<p>With the car windows closed up, Bendtner called his father.</p>
<p>Although he had been in England for four years, his family was still in Denmark and he lived alone in Nottingham. He first lived in a hostel provided by the team and then moved out to rent a house. Unlike his other teammates, he had not bought a house in the city till now.</p>
<p>“Dad, he refused.”</p>
<p>“I know. It’s all over the media.”</p>
<p>“How did you talk to him yesterday?”</p>
<p>Thomas heard some concern in his son’s voice, and he smiled to comfort his son, “Don’t worry. I put all my responsibility on myself, and it has nothing to do with you. We’re going to prepare for the worst. Even if you don’t end up leaving, he won’t make things difficult for you.”</p>
<p>Bendtner was slightly relieved to hear his father say so. He was only “slightly.” These days, Bendtner was under immense psychological pressure as he trained every day. As soon as he saw the boss wearing sunglasses on the sidelines, he would feel a pair of eyes staring at himself.</p>
<p>As a determined “traitor” who wanted to escape the kingdom, while meticulously plotting the escape plan, he needed to be wary of the king. If the plan fell through and was exposed, a very harsh and cruel punishment would be waiting for him… This was no exaggeration. Bendtner and Anelka were not the same.</p>
<p>The Frenchman wanted to go, and Twain also wanted to drive him away. He only wanted to punish him before he left</p>
<p>On the other hand, Bendtner wanted to go, but Twain did not want him to go. Then the matter was not so simple as to discipline him before letting him go. This was a “revolt” to oppose the king’s will.</p>
<p>How could there not be any psychological pressure in doing such a thing?</p>
<p>“Train with a peace of mind and don’t think about anything else. I’ll take care of everything.” The father comforted his son, “If any reporter asks the question, just maintain silent and don’t accept any interviews…”</p>
<p>“But Dad, how can I put pressure on him if I don’t take a stand?”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to deal with this. I’ll put the pressure on him. I don’t want you to get involved. I’ll be the bad guy…”</p>
<p>Just then, Bendtner was startled by a knocking sound on the glass next to his ear, which startled him.</p>
<p>He turned his head around to find that it was Lennon who had just arrived. He leaned forward to the window and gestured to him, asking him why he did not go to the locker room.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Dad, my teammate came to look for me…”</p>
<p>“Ah… All right, you go on. Oh! Remember, if Twain comes to you, find an excuse to put it off…”</p>
<p>Bendtner quickly hung up the phone and got out of the car.</p>
<p>Lennon smiled at him, “Who you calling for so long? A girlfriend?”</p>
<p>Bendtner was worried about not knowing how to answer when Lennon gave him a reason. He smiled a little stiffly, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Oh—how long have you known each other? Even we don’t know. Wow, you’re very secretive. Must be a beauty!”</p>
<p>“He he, I’ll call her out to meet everyone when there’s a chance the next time.”</p>
<p>Bendtner absentmindedly answered Lennon’s question on how beautiful his girlfriend was and left the parking lot side by side with him.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>During a break in the training, Twain did look for Bendtner, wanting to speak to him alone. Mindful of his father’s instructions, Bendtner declined the suggestion on the pretext that he had a date with his girlfriend. To prove that he must show up for the date, he even said it was his girlfriend’s birthday.</p>
<p>Twain cocked his head and looked at Bendtner for a while. His direct gaze scared him, and he almost came forth to confess. That was when Twain nodded and agreed. But before he left, he said, “I hope we both can have a good talk tomorrow.”</p>
<p>As soon as Twain turned around, Bendtner’s eyebrows drooped down—what reason he could find for tomorrow…</p>
<p>The training resumed. Twain stood on the side to watch when the cell phone in his pocket rang.</p>
<p>He knew there was only one person who would call him at this time because he had just rejected Manchester City’s offer earlier.</p>
<p>He pulled out his cell phone and stood by the training ground as he pressed the answer button.</p>
<p>“Hello, Mr. Thomas Bendtner.” He said in a cold voice.</p>
<p>“Hello, Mr. Tony Twain.” The voice over there carried a hint of smile.</p>
<p>“You must be annoyed that I turned down Manchester City’s offer, right?”</p>
<p>“No, how can I be? I understand that because their offer is too low. My son shouldn’t be worth only eighteen million pounds.”</p>
<p>“This is not a matter of price, Mr. Bendtner. Your son is not for sale by the club. He is the future of Nottingham Forest, and for the next ten years, he will be the team’s leading striker and the number one center forward!” Twain put weight to his tone in the hope that the old man would understand how important his son’s status was.</p>
<p>“As far as I know, a lot of clubs claim that certain players are not for sale, but they still change hands and sell them to the highest bidder.” Perhaps he sensed that Twain would be angry with this remark, so he hurriedly added, “I agree with your first remark, Mr. Twain. It’s really not about the price. It’s about the player’s will. As I said, it’s unsuitable for my son to continue to stay here because you simply can’t keep the promises you made to him… No, don’t talk about the future. I hope you respect the individual will of the player. Did not you just agree to let Piqué go back to Barcelona? Why can’t you respect my son’s idea the same way?”</p>
<p>“This is completely different!” Twain growled.</p>
<p>This was certainly different. He definitely did not spent as much efforts on Piqué like he did on Bendtner.</p>
<p>“I think it makes no difference. You have van Nistelrooy who can play as the center forward anyway.”</p>
<p>Twain felt that he had nothing to talk about with this stubborn old man who adamantly refused to believe him. He brusquely hung up the phone and stood there as he seethed.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Manchester City raised their offer again, which saw them made a twenty-million bid to purchase Bendtner.</p>
<p>After some secret warfare, the Manchester United Football Club bought Berbatov for 30.75 million pounds. The transfer market had fewer and fewer good center forwards. If Manchester City did not hurry up, the transfer window would be closed soon. Then even if Bendtner really wanted to go, he must wait until January. Half a year’s time was not long and not short either. Who knew what would happen between now and then?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manchester City finally managed to sign the deal with the Brazilian star, Robinho who was at odds with the top brass at Real Madrid, costing them a fee of forty million pounds after much hard work. Schuster was extremely unhappy with this deal, but what could he do? He was not a manager at an English club. In the Spanish clubs, the club’s sporting director had more authority than the head coach. He did not dare to do anything but complain about a summer wasted, the winger, Ronaldo that he had planned did come, the original winger, Robinho was gone, and now the team only one winger, which had a negative impact on the team’s tactics.</p>
<p>At this point, the transfer drama was basically coming to an end, with the entire world following closely the news that Manchester City was chasing Bendtner because it could perhaps be the last bombshell before the summer transfer window closed.</p>
<p>Bendtner rose to fame along with Nottingham Forest’s three seasons in the Premier League and European football arena. He was no longer the young rising star of the future, but a star player calling the shots. He was the main center forward in the Denmark team and also had a stable goal-scoring rate in the Forest team. Many teams’ managers thought that Bendtner had a bright future. If Twain had not held onto him tightly, people would have stand in line to buy him long ago.</p>
<p>However, this time, Twain finally met an opponent who was good at hounding and had thick skin. Most importantly, this opponent was very, very rich.</p>
<p>They could not buy van Nistelrooy because the Dutchman did not want to leave the Forest team for Manchester City, so Twain and the club were able to reject confidently. After all, no matter how much money was offered, the player himself did not want to leave, which was out of their hands. Bendtner’s situation was completely different. Now the player himself wanted to leave…</p>
<p>Twain patiently waited for Bendtner to finish celebrating his girlfriend’s birthday, and then looked for him again. This time he was going to have to talk to the Danish kid in person no matter what.</p>
<p>“Can we have a chat after the training ends? It’s about the recent transfer rumors.”</p>
<p>“This…” Bendtner felt a little awkward.</p>
<p>“Your father won’t let you talk to me, would he?”</p>
<p>Bendtner looked up in amazement at his boss.</p>
<p>“He did not tell me, but any fool could guess the connection.” Twain said with a smile. “I think It’s necessary for me to talk to you. I want to know what you think. You know, the day before yesterday I realized one thing: I thought I knew the person I see all the time very well but in fact, I do not know him at all.”</p>
<p>Having said that, Twain tilted his head slightly and looked at Bendtner in front of him.</p>
<p>Bendtner was hesitant. Should he listen to his father, or the boss?</p>
<p>In the end, he chose the latter. He knew what his father was afraid in not letting him talk to his boss. Ribéry was taken to Mallorca by his agent to hide from the boss at that time. In the end, Ribéry’s attitude changed immediately after the boss made a trip to Mallorca.</p>
<p>The boss was an expert at words and best at using words to stir up people’s sentiments. He knew this very well. But he was also confident in his resolve. This time, no matter how well the boss spoke, he would not stay.</p>
<p>It was not that he was hard-hearted. It was because he knew that things had come to a head. If all that he had achieved went down the gutter and he would have chosen to stay in the end, he was not sure that the boss would not look for an opportunity to make life difficult for him. He appeared broad-minded, but in fact he was narrow-minded. He would always remember that he let him down.</p>
<p>Once the relationship between two people had the slightest crack, it was impossible to be perfect as before. It was inevitable that it would be awkward in the two people’s interaction.</p>
<p>In this respect, he had no way out this time.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>Twain smiled, “After the training ends at noon, I would like to invite you to lunch. What do you like?”</p>
<p>“The cafeteria will do.” After Bendtner made his decision, his mood was a lot more relaxed. “I’m not particular about what I eat.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>During the noon break, most of the players chose to go home. Only a small number of people would stay in the training base’s cafeteria for lunch.</p>
<p>Twain and Bendtner found a small corner and started their lunch with “things on their minds other than food.”</p>
<p>The two people ate their meal in silence at first. Once the meal was almost done, Twain wiped his mouth with a napkin. He wanted to talk. Bendtner saw his look and stopped what he was doing.</p>
<p>“Your father told me that you plan to leave?”</p>
<p>Bendtner was already mentally prepared. He nodded without hesitation.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me why?” Twain said amiably. There was no hint of anger.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’m being put to important use here.”</p>
<p>Accordingly, Twain began to give him a list of figures, proving that his number of appearances for the Forest team had gradually increased over the past few seasons. His rate of goals scored was also steady. He even cited his performance in a few important games to prove that he was really an important member of the team.</p>
<p>Bendtner just shook his head and said, “Honestly, boss… I don’t like the position you give me. I’m a center forward and my job is to score. But more often than not, I have to pass the ball to my teammates on the pitch…”</p>
<p>Twain suddenly saw the light. Was this what he meant when he said he was not being put to important use?</p>
<p>However, this complicated the issue. In Twain’s tactical system, the center forward would not simply be used to score goals. Most of the time, they needed to contribute to the team’s overall offense. An assist was a very important indicator. Van Nistelrooy’s ability had not actually diminished when he came to Nottingham Forest, but he had not won the Premier League’s top striker again because most of the time he needed to sacrifice his place in the penalty area, pull to the middle of the backfield, even support his teammates at the sides and act as a bridgehead to protect the ball. As a result, he scored fewer goals than he did at Manchester United. But van Nistelrooy did not complain, nor had he ever publicly or privately revealed his displeasure with the arrangement. That was one of the reasons Twain specially liked van Nistelrooy.</p>
<p>Now Bendtner was completely at odds with Twain’s tactical habits, which made him a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Why do you think so? Nicklas, the center forward is also a member of the team. You help the team by doing so, which is also not bad for you.”</p>
<p>“Boss, I don’t want to be a center forward with more assists than the number of goals scored.” Bendtner said resolutely as he already had a plan in his mind. “I’m only interested in scoring goals.”</p>
<p>Twain grinned, “I thought everyone was used to my tactics at Nottingham Forest. I did not think someone would oppose it here. If the team can’t win the game, is it useful for the striker to score more goals?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think the team can win if the striker can’t score.”</p>
<p>Twain listened to him say so and sighed, “I am now more determined in my idea that you should continue to develop and grow … You had it backwards, Nicklas. Teams that don’t know how to defend can’t win games. Defense is the foundation of everything.”</p>
<p>Bendtner spread his hands and said, “This is where we differ, boss. I revere offense, and you’re more conservative.”</p>
<p>“Ha, I’m conservative?” There was a lot of media out that used this word to describe him, but Twain did not expect to hear this word from one of his players’ mouth. “Well, I’m fine with people saying I’m conservative as long as I can win the championship titles. Don’t you like championship titles?” Twain stared at the reckless kid in front of him and asked in return.</p>
<p>“I like. But I want to win the championship titles my own way.”</p>
<p>Bendtner looked directly at Twain and did not flinch.</p>
<p>“Very well, very well.” Twain pushed away the cutlery placed in front of him and stood to get up. “Then you use your way to win the championship titles!”</p>
<p>Having said that, he left without turning his head back.</p>
<p>He did not expect things to end up like this…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Thomas Bendtner was pleased to hear his son’s retelling and said, “It looks like he’s agreed to let you go, son!”</p>
<p>As a result, Twain once again rejected Manchester City’s twenty million-pound transfer offer the next day. The reason was no different from before. He stated, “Bendtner is not for sale. He’s the future of the team. I will not be a fool and give him to others. I won’t do it for money!”</p>
<p>It was hard to guess what he was thinking. It was obvious that he parted on bad terms with Bendtner yesterday after their talk. Why did he immediately act like a private deal had been brokered with Bendtner?</p>
<p>Just after he turned down Manchester City for the second time, another man at the club finally could not sit still and came to Twain in person, hoping to talk to him frankly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 677.1 - A High Asking Price</p>
<p>Without having to guess or even think about it, the person who looked for Twain and wanted to talk to him must be Allan Adams. </p>
<p>His nose was even more sensitive than a hound when it came to money. </p>
<p>Twain also knew that sooner or later he would seek him out. He had ruined two of what he had considered as good deals this summer. One deal involved Ribéry, and the other was the just-concluded van Nistelrooy's "blank check-gate." The club's financial situation would be greatly improved if one of these two deals was clinched. </p>
<p>This time if Allan did not come looking for him, he would no longer be the club's marketing manager. </p>
<p>"I know you would come looking for me. Look." Twain pointed to the table with two cups of steaming coffee on it. "I've been preparing two cups these few days." </p>
<p>Allan felt helpless and had very few ways of dealing with a hooligan like Twain. </p>
<p>"Well, Tony. Since you know I would come look for you, you obviously know why. I'm not going to talk nonsense. Can you listen to my opinion?" </p>
<p>Twain gestured for him to go ahead and sat in his chair. </p>
<p>"Honestly I don't know much about what's going on within the team, so I don't know what you think of Bendtner. But I think selling him will be the best option now." </p>
<p>Twain nodded to indicate to him to continue. </p>
<p>"On the one hand, Bendtner completely does not want to stay in the team now. It would be unwise to force such a player to stay. It can also cause unrest in the locker room." At this point, Allan glanced at Twain and found that he had his head down, as if he was in deep thought. After all, this touched on Twain's domain and he was afraid that Twain would react badly. Now, he was able to breathe a sigh of relief from the looks of it. So, he continued, "On the other hand, I'm not going to hide from you, Tony. The club is in great need of money now. After you promised to increase Ribéry's pay, the rest of the team also had the same idea. We have to meet their demands. In addition, the actual cost of building a new stadium is more than we have budgeted. Some of the expenditure is completely out of control..." </p>
<p>In this regard, Allan must admit that his inexperience caused it. After all, he had not undertaken any engineering projects before, and did not know a lot of inside knacks. He only discovered that a lot of things had not been fully considered before until the new stadium started construction. Consequently, he could only use money to fill in... </p>
<p>"Thirdly ... the global economic environment is not very good." </p>
<p>Twain did not understand what Allan said. He was an idiot when it came to economics. The term "global economic environment" sounded alien to him. </p>
<p>"We need money to deal with some emergencies." After that, Allan spread his hands. He had already said everything he could say to Twain. After working with Twain for several years, he became familiar with this man's character. Twain's character was very tough and could sometimes be a little outrageous, but he was not made of stone. There were only two ways to get him to accept what he was unwilling to do: the first was to persuade him with kind words and discuss the stakes clearly. He was a smart man and naturally knew which was the best choice; the second was to bypass Twain directly and keep him out of the loop which was simple and rough. He would only be informed once the matter was decided and began to be implemented, which was the so-called "the rice is cooked." </p>
<p>The second approach would certainly permanently damage the relationship between the two people. Allan would not choose to do so unless it was his last resort. As for the first approach... the only risk was not knowing if Twain would be persuaded each time. </p>
<p>Such as this time. </p>
<p>After quietly listening to Allan's speech, Twain was silent for a moment before he looked up at the other side. "That's right, Allan. I have to apologize to you." </p>
<p>"Huh?" Allan Adams was baffled. </p>
<p>"About the matter with van Nistelrooy. I did not have any discussion with you about what I was going to do. You must be angry, aren't you?" Twain said to Allan seriously. </p>
<p>Allan hurriedly waved and said, "I knew what you wanted to do, but I really didn't know how you were going to do. Besides, don't think of me as weak. Although I am a businessman, I am also a man of temper. That kind of nearly insulting behavior from Manchester City was unacceptable to me. A businessman values equal relationship when doing business. Everyone is equal, no one is more precious than the other." </p>
<p>Seeing Allan's earnest explanation, Twain smiled first. </p>
<p>"Can you give me some time to think about the matter with Bendtner?" </p>
<p>Allan knew he could not ask Twain to make a decision now. He was already giving him face by being willing to consider it, rather than rebuffing him right away. So, he stood up and nodded, "Remember you don't have much time, Tony." </p>
<p>※※※ </p>
<p>Indeed, time was running out. It was August 27th now, less than four days before the transfer window closed. </p>
<p>Twain did not speak to Bendtner again and Bendtner's father did not call Twain again. Manchester City did not make another new offer. Did they perhaps give up? Was this matter going to be quietly resolved just like that? </p>
<p>It was obviously impossible. </p>
<p>Twain was trying to calm his heart, and then sort things out. Despite parting on bad terms with Bendtner during that face to face talk, Twain was still reluctant to let the Dane go. It was mainly... he did not want to sell him to Manchester City. The thought of those Arabs' faces made him feel sick. </p>
<p>As Twain stood alone on the sidelines of the training ground, he heard a sudden commotion coming from the training ground. </p>
<p>A fight? </p>
<p>Since the incident with Chimbonda and Bendtner, Twain had been very sensitive to this. He hurriedly came out of his reverie and stared over. </p>
<p>A group of people ran towards a point. Through the seams of the crowd, he saw the team's number one center forward, van Nistelrooy, kneading his thighs as he sat helplessly on the ground. </p>
<p>Was he hurt? </p>
<p>He ran over to see what happened. </p>
<p>The team members consciously cleared a path when they saw the boss came. He went straight to van Nistelrooy's side and asked Fleming, who was busy, "What's going on?" </p>
<p>"He pulled his thigh muscle." Fleming heard Twain's voice and glanced up at him. Perhaps he comprehended something else in the other man's frown, so he added, "It's not a big deal, but he certainly can't appear in this weekend's game." </p>
<p>Hearing him say so, van Nistelrooy smiled and comforted Twain, "I'm all right, boss." </p>
<p>Twain nodded and then withdrew. Dunn saw what happened on the side and rushed up to say, "The starting list needs to be adjusted. Bendtner..." </p>
<p>Twain shook his head and said, "We're playing 4-5-1 for the game the day after." </p>
<p>"And who's going to be the '1?'" </p>
<p>"Eastwood." </p>
<p>Dunn looked strangely at Twain. </p>
<p>Twain did not respond to his doubts and just turned to walk away. </p>
<p>As a result, Dunn looked back at Bendtner in the crowd. He stood on the side and drank water while his teammates chatted about van Nistelrooy's unexpected injury. Lennon seemed to be talking to him about something, but it was clear that Bendtner was distracted. </p>
<p>Did he hope to play in this game or not? </p>
<p>※※※ </p>
<p>In the third round of the league tournament, Nottingham Forest definitely faced a tough rival---it was Chelsea, their long-time rival which they had been entangled with for these few seasons. </p>
<p>It was just that Chelsea's manager was not Mourinho or Grant, but "Big Phil" Scolari. </p>
<p>Although only two rounds had been started for the new season, this was also a focal match. The media started to hype the game, and they came up to ask Scolari on how Chelsea had not beaten Tony Twain's Forest team. </p>
<p>The Brazilian was very clever. He did not fall for it. He simply said it was another person's results which had nothing to do with him. Then he refused to answer such questions again. </p>
<p>Twain had been busy fighting with Manchester City during the period and did not have the energy to act in concert with the media and start a war of words with Scolari. Looking at how he was currently so busy, it was real worrying whether he was ready for the game against Chelsea... </p>
<p>The day before the game, Twain announced the squad list of the next day's match in Wilford. Nicklas Bendtner's name was not on it. </p>
<p>No one was shocked by this now. The players were not blind or deaf, much less fools. They all knew of the news that Bendtner and Twain had a falling out and were aware that this player was already determined to leave the team. Some people understood the reasons for his leaving, while the others scoffed at it. </p>
<p>Therefore, when Bendtner did not appear on the squad list, everyone knew the boss intentionally did this. It is punishment, isn't it? Yes, it must be a punishment and warning to a traitor. </p>
<p>Bendtner looked terrible standing among the team. When Twain gave the word "dismissed", he was the first to turn around and walk away. </p>
<p>He knew he must leave, but he could not accept being treated like this before his departure. There was no longer the slightest bit of yearning for this team in his heart. He had decided that if the team did not let him go, he would return to Denmark and boycott the training! </p>
<p>"Tony, can you explain to me a little, your purpose in doing what you did?" Dunn asked on the way home. He had noticed Bendtner's behavior just now and was somewhat worried. </p>
<p>"A certain someone pointed the finger at me and questioned my tactical thinking. I want to let him know who's the boss on the team." Twain's voice was frosty. </p>
<p>Dunn sighed. He knew that Twain was truly furious. </p>
<p>"But ... have you decided what you are going to do about the matter?" He was referring to the matter about Bendtner's transfer. </p>
<p>Twain shook his head this time and sounded somewhat lost from his tone, "I don't know..." </p>
<p>He really did not know. On the one hand, he was angry at Bendtner's betrayal. On the other hand, it was not easy to put aside four years of time and the efforts that he once poured into him. Should he admit defeat and let him go? Or should he force him to stay in the team and neither side would win? </p>
<p>While Twain felt helpless, the cell phone in his pocket rang. </p>
<p>He fished out his cell phone to take a look. Twain smiled and said, "Bendtner's father is calling. He must have known that his son is not on the squad list for tomorrow's game. I didn't think that Bendtner is still such a good boy. He tells his father everything at the first instance. Tsk tsk..." </p>
<p>He shook his head as he answered the call. </p>
<p>"Hello, Mr. Thomas Bendtner. I'm glad you still remembered to call me. I waited all day for your call yesterday to no avail. I thought you gave up." </p>
<p>Twain spoke politely and full of warmth. But Thomas Bendtner did not smile at all on the other end of the line. His biggest fear was that his son would become a target of Tony Twain's retaliation. Now it appeared as if his fears came true. </p>
<p>"I think it's time for us lay our cards on the table, Mr. Twain." </p>
<p>"What's that?" Twain pretended to be surprised. "Did we not already lay our cards long ago?" </p>
<p>"..." </p>
<p>"Your son insists on leaving but I won't let him go. Isn't that the case?" </p>
<p>Twain held up the phone to deal with Thomas Bendtner as he walked. </p>
<p>"I think I need to remind you, Mr. Twain. My son's contract with the Forest Club expires in July next year. Furthermore, we have already discussed and settled with my son's agent, Mr. Juric, that we will not negotiate any renewal with the Forest team. I'm suggesting this based on kind intentions. Let my son go now, and you'll still have money to earn. If you wait a year..." </p>
<p>Twain suddenly clutched the phone and then threw it out. The quality of the new phone was better than the previous one. It just bounced once on the ground and chipped a corner. </p>
<p>Next to him, Dunn watched in astonishment at the scene happening in front of him. He did not know what Bendtner's father said to Twain over the phone to actually make him so angry. He twisted his head to look over to find Twain looking furious. </p>
<p>"Son of a bitch, you dare threaten me!" </p>
<p>Dunn ran to the front to pick up the cell phone and discovered the chipped corner before he handed it to Twain. He said, "You have to change your bad habit of throwing the phone every time you get angry." </p>
<p>"I only have this thing on my hand to throw ... Give me the phone, yours... Don't worry, I won't throw it." Twain did not take his cell phone, but asked Dunn for his. </p>
<p>Dunn gave his phone to Twain, who dialed Allan Adams' cell phone number. </p>
<p>"Allan, give Manchester City a response and just say that don't think about buying Nicklas Bendtner for less than thirty million pounds!" </p>
<p>"Tony..." When he heard him say so, Dunn was a little worried and asked, "Isn't this price too high?" </p>
<p>Twain hung up and returned the phone to Dunn. He said to him at the same time, "Doesn't Manchester City like to be a rich sucker? I'll let them be one!"</p>
<p>He looked so fierce that it frightened Dunn even more... "What did Thomas Bendtner say to you?" </p>
<p>"He told me that Bendtner's contract is one year away and they do not plan to talk to the club about renewing his contract." Twain looked at Dunn and said, "I've forgotten about this matter before." </p>
<p>Dunn went, "..." </p>
<p>※※※ </p>
<p>On the morning of the match against Chelsea, the Nottingham media were still waging a war of words with the Manchester City Football Club. The asking price of thirty million pounds caused Mark Hughes to lash out at Tony Twain for being insatiable. Pierce Brosnan helped Twain to hit back in the Evening Post, saying that Nottingham Forest's future star and the number one goalscorer for the next decade, had a promising bright future, and was tagged as van Nistelrooy's successor. Moreover, it was only fair that the handsome Nicklas Bendtner was only selling for thirty million... </p>
<p>Allan Adams stuck to his guns and refused to budge from the asking price of thirty million pounds. He was not afraid of Manchester City. Because now all of England knew that Manchester City's problems with their strikers had reached a point where it must be resolved. </p>
<p>Manchester City had previously contacted Jô, a young Brazilian striker who had scored thirty goals in fifty-three games for CSKA Moscow. Although Jô would like to play in the Premier League, the transfer would be extremely complicated. Jô's ownership was not in the hands of CSKA Moscow, but in the hands of Media Sport Investment Limited (MSI), just like Mascherano and Tevez did at the time. MSI did not agree to release him this time due to unhappiness over Tevez's transfer to Manchester United that year. The English Football Association had also stated they wanted to block the transfer. In addition to the current owners not wanting to let go of the player, there was another factor that plagued Manchester City---he was not eligible for a work permit. </p>
<p>Jô's matter dragged on like this. MSI did not intend to relent even though the transfer window was about to close. With no other choice, Manchester City had to go all out for Bendtner. </p>
<p>It was against this background that Allan dared to drag his heels and demand an exorbitant amount from Manchester City. </p>
<p>Over here, Allan demanded a high asking price from the Manchester City club. Over there, Twain's team met with a hard battle. </p>
<p>There was no gain without a loss. On the verge of a major victory in the transfer market, Nottingham Forest could likely face the end of a minor record... </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 678: End of an Affinity</p>
<p>Twain was indeed in a state of crisis.</p>
<p>The first half was ending and his team was behind 0 : 1 on home ground.That old man Scolari was different from his previous two predecessors, but perhaps it was due to owner Abramovich’s personal aspiration which took effect that Scolari, after being in charge, emphasised more on ball control or the so-called “beautiful football”. As the new main coach, appeasing the club president was mandatory.</p>
<p>But for Twain, all his knowledge on Chelsea was overthrown.</p>
<p>From the start of the competition, Chelsea on away was already extremely aggressive on offense and that aggression completely exceeded the expectations of the players of the Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>No matter how many times Chelsea changes its head coach, their rivalry with Nottingham Forest will not dissipate if the players are the same. It had barely been 3 months since the end of the UEFA Champions League finals, not long enough for them to forget who they lost to in the championships.</p>
<p>The aggressive attack gave them a goal. And in just thirteen minutes, the away team Chelsea was leading. However, at this moment, Nottingham Forest did not make a single shot after each round of aggressive attack from their opponents.</p>
<p>“Exactly who owns this home ground?” John Motson asked skeptically.</p>
<p>That also was Twain’s question.</p>
<p>The first meeting with Chelsea with their recently changed coach actually made him felt quite unfamiliar. Scolari was just as arrogant as his predecessors yet he seemed humble before this match. Twain felt like he was holding back from devising evil intentions.</p>
<p>It was only the first half, but the psychological advantage they accumulated from previous encounters with Chelsea was slowly diminishing. Twain felt that he should reevaluate the opponent, because this Chelsea was no longer Mourinho’s Chelsea but “Big Phil’s”. The Chelsea from Grant’s time still carried Mourinho’s personality, but that had been disappearing bit by bit since Scolari was in charge.</p>
<p>For example, such positive sportsmanship, plays leadings to goals was nicer to watch as compared to Mourinho’s.</p>
<p>Abramovich wanted to watch beautiful soccer so he dismissed Mourinho and Grant who brought the team to the finals of the UEFA Champions league to hire the Brazillian Scolari. But, from what Grant knew of Scolari, just how long could this scene last?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain was faced with a dilemma. When he was coaching Nottingham Forest, their odds of winning could reach 87% if they scored the first goal. This checks out perfectly with Nottingham Forest’s niche — make the first goal and then defend against the counter-attack. Scoring the goal greatly increased their lead, while not being able to score also meant they would not lose it. 1:0 was still an acceptable good result.</p>
<p>In this situation, their opponents would only have 2 options — either they become increasingly impatient or they do nothing and lose.</p>
<p>Currently, Twain was in the same scenario his opponents were in. Which path should he choose?</p>
<p>During the half-time break he gave his team a series of pep-talks, telling them they definitely could not lose to Chelsea on home ground and asking them to preserve in attacking the flanks. Other than that, he asked Eastwood to not constantly run out of the penalty area to receive the ball. There were five midfielders so the ball would definitely be passed to him, but if he was always too far from the goalmouth, how could he immediately challenge Chelsea’s goal?</p>
<p>Regarding this point, Eastwood also had his troubles. In the past, he was always partnered with strong second-strikers like Van Nistelrooy, Bendtner or Vidukar. The second-striker is responsible for drawing the opponent’s defensive firepower to himself, which meant Eastwood could attack freely near the penalty area. Naturally, this increased Eastwood’s threat level.</p>
<p>But now? He became the center forward, the main character and the main defending target of the opposing center back. Under the constant close pressure from strong center-backs like Terry, being able to ensure the ball reach him without having it stolen already expunged almost all of his energy, how could he even score afterwards? Besides, his stature was not one of a strong center forward. He would frequently lose his ball to his opponents’ tackles.</p>
<p>How could Twain not know of his troubles? Obviously Twain knew, but he had no choice. Who told him to place the Danish kid outside the roster for the sake of punishing Bendtner?</p>
<p>Even without his rivalry with Chelsea, he would not allow the team to lose to Chelsea, because that was telling Bentner that Twain’s team was unable to play without him.</p>
<p>“I know you have your difficulties, Freddy. We won’t let you be the attacking point, you just need to hold the ball, leave the remaining work to…” he pointed at Ribery and van der Vaart. “Both of you readily attack, shoot the ball more.”</p>
<p>Basically this was to allow Eastwood to create opportunities for his side attacking teammates.</p>
<p>The Romani nodded, but he did not know if he could fulfil the “center forward role.” Honestly speaking, he had no confidence…</p>
<p>“Be patient, we will definitely find a hole in their defense line. I feel that Scolari will continue attacking in the second half, there will definitely be issues surfacing in their defensive line.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>During the second half, Chelsea was indeed continuing their attack, and there was a gap in their defensive line. But similarly, Nottingham Forest, impatiently trying to even out the score, also had issues in their defensive line.</p>
<p>During this competition, Twain was not successful with his dual defensive midfielder tactic. George Wood’s active range of offense was large as always, but his style of running limited Tiago’s abilities, and with Wood’s habit of doing everything by himself, Tiago was unable to adapt. This was the first time they were playing together, so it was understandable that they had no chemistry.</p>
<p>Thus, this display of dual defensive midfielders was no better than a single defensive midfielder. Subsequently, Wood noticed his coached rapport with Tiago, but the bigger issue surfaced — some possessions would appear to be in the middle of the two players and both, in sync, will give up the ball for the other! Thinking that this ball was for the other player, they gave it up to the Chelsea’s player instead.</p>
<p>Chelsea then helped themselves.</p>
<p>Drogba took advantage of that one misunderstanding between the two defensive midfielders, cut straight through the middle, easily broke through the thin defensive line, and then successfully made a shot. At the sixty-fifth minute of the whole competition, away team Chelsea was ahead by two goals!</p>
<p>The Chelsea players were celebrating on the field. Off the court, even Scolari was jumping wildly with both his hands up, akin to an energetic monkey. However, Twain was only showing a stern face.</p>
<p>Not long after losing the goal, he substituted Arshavin for Tiago, changing back to solo defensive midfielder, dual strikers in a 4-4-2 formation. After returning to the familiar formation, team Nottingham Forest regained their competitive tempo.</p>
<p>First, it was Eastwood passing the ball back to van der Vaart. The Dutch immediately took a long shot against Čech, who saved the ball with a dive. Following the corner kick, Pepe’s header hit the arm of Ashley Cole, who was standing on the penalty line. Nottingham Forest’s players raised their hands to signal the handball foul, but the head referee did not notice, and did not regard the protests of the players of the Nottingham Forest team.</p>
<p>Off the court, Twain was pointing his own eyes as a protest towards the fourth official, but it was futile. It was impossible for the head referee to call for a pause in the middle of a play to give Nottingham Forest a penalty. Even if the television screens repeatedly proved that Nottingham Forest was treated unfairly, referees would not follow the television screens to change their own judgement. This was prohibited by the rules of FIFA.</p>
<p>Without their tall center forward, Twain made the team do fewer high balls, play more ground possessions and do more through passes, hence maximising the speed superiorities of some players in the formation.</p>
<p>Scolari saw through Twain. At this moment, he signaled for the team to recover its formation — shrinking back to its defense and not giving Nottingham Forest any chances to use its through passes and speed.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest did not regard its defense. It was almost a full-out attack, trying to even out the score. But up until the eighty-two minute, Nottingham Forest used a free kick to even the score after eighty-two minutes. The scorer was Gareth Bale.</p>
<p>After that, the counterattack of Nottingham Forest was even crazier. Scolari had no choice but to make some substitutions, changing his striker and defender, in hopes of securing this one goal advantage.</p>
<p>At this moment, he did not care for the aesthetics of the scene; getting the three points was of utmost importance. At this moment, Scolari was definitely not the type to listen to his boss and diligently play “beautiful soccer”.</p>
<p>Twain then sent out Patrov to replace Ribery who was unable to run anymore. This substitution was of no choice… he initially wanted to switch out a defender to leave only three and continue to strengthen his offense. However, Ribery was simply too tired to run anymore — he fell directly to the ground with his left calf cramping. In the early seasons, this phenomenon has never occurred; it looked like the negative effects from that hectic summer was showing.</p>
<p>That substitution did little for the team’s offense. Ultimately, Nottingham Forest lost its first home game this league, losing to Chelsea 1:2. Their undefeated record against Chelsea ever since they were promoted into the Premier League had become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>When it comes to records, Twain did not take them too seriously. Conversely, he felt that breaking it was a blessing, otherwise his players would have to bear a ridiculous amount of pressure every season when they face Chelsea.</p>
<p>However, losing a match was not a great thing. Losing their first game in the league ruined the home game opener; more importantly, they lost face in front of Bendtner. Losing this match was as good as telling Bendtner that the team was unable to win without him…</p>
<p>This was what infuriated Twain the most.</p>
<p>During the post-game conference, a reporter who wanted to be a troublemaker intentionally asked why Bendtner did not appear on the roster of this match, because to his knowledge the Danish center forward was neither injured nor in a bad state.</p>
<p>Twain angrily glanced at this female reporter, “He has hemorrhoids, could you have understood this?”</p>
<p>Having had her jibe backfire on her, she glared balefully at Twain and sat back down.</p>
<p>After leaving the city’s soccer field, Twain gave Allan W. Adams a call, waiting to see if there was news regarding the transfers for Bendtner.</p>
<p>Actually, had Nottingham Forest won this match, Twain might have changed his plans to forcefully keep Bendtner, displaying a winner’s attitude in front of him. However, now that he lost the competition, Bendtner had to leave. He could not tolerate having a player who mocked his personality and his soccer knowledge near him, when they have to seem nice to each other everyday.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Bendtner did not appear to watch the match, it was as if he already was not a member of the Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>He was packing his luggage in his condominium while waiting restlessly for the call. Like a girl plotting to elope, the fear could not mask his excitement and yearning for a beautiful future. The television was on, showing Nottingham Forest welcoming Chelsea for the match. He snuck a few looks, but was not in the mood to keep up with the match.</p>
<p>After Chelsea scored the second ball, Juric gave him a call. “They promised to take you away, Nicklas.”</p>
<p>After hearing that from his manager, Bendtner sat on the sofa, finally in the mood to pay attention to the match. After all, he did wear the red jersey for four years.</p>
<p>Watching his own teammates on field attacking furiously while some ran like headless chickens, he really did not know how he should feel about this. It was rare to see Nottingham Forest being so helpless, as if there was no way to score a goal other than long shots. Ribery and Lennon were attacking forcefully, but there was little they could do in the face of Chelsea progressively pulling back their defensive line. They had no choice but to yield possession to them after breaking through..</p>
<p>If he were on the field, the midfielders could send the ball to either his head or his feet. Whether he scored or assisted his team mates, he would liven up the offence in Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>The camera cut to the side of the field where Twain was orchestrating the match. He was signalling for the team to do more long shots, but he looked menacing, and it made him look like he was descending into madness.</p>
<p>The media once gave Twain the nickname “clown”, but it was different from Aimar. This “clown” had an obvious connotation of humiliation. But as Bendtner watched him on television today, he realised that this nickname was actually perfect for him. He really was a clown…</p>
<p>At the end of the match, Nottingham Forest scored a goal, but it did not change the result of the game. With a dark look on his face, Twain quickly left the court. Bendtner turned off the television and continued packing his things.</p>
<p>Now, it was none of his concern what happened to Nottingham Forest and Tony Twain.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Allan, what are the intentions of Man City?” Twain did not know the latest transfer progresses.</p>
<p>“There’s still no reply from them.”</p>
<p>” I think… Allan, do you think they think the price was too high?”</p>
<p>“No, Tony. Just like what your reporter friend said, thirty million is a fair price to pay for the next 10 years of Nottingham Forest’s main center forward. Don’t worry about the things here, leave everything to me. It’s a pity, losing the match.”</p>
<p>Twain pouted. Was Allan hinting at him to put more energy into the team’s training and matches instead of the transfer market and other clubs, managers, some star’s father’s intrigue?</p>
<p>“Both us and Chelsea are first-grade soccer teams, no matter who won or lost is normal. As long as the final championship is ours, that’s all that matters.”</p>
<p>Allan laughed, “Ha ha! Sure, we will wait for the final champions, Tony.”</p>
<p>After putting down the phone, Twain left the empty changing room and boarded the bus.</p>
<p>“Go back and rest, my buddies. This match gave everyone here a reminder — this is a new season, the Double Winners from last season means nothing.” In the cabin, Twain spread out his hands and said, “Forget about the Double Winners, now we have to restart from square one!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>On the second day after the match, Man City and Nottingham Forest released the news at the same time.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest’s young center forward Nikolas Bendtner will officially be transferred to Man City, tied by a four-year contract with a weekly salary of £120,000, involving a transfer fee of £30 million.</p>
<p>This soap drama finally came to an end. Some people gained, some people lost. People who gained lost some things at the same time, and people people who lost… did not gain anything.</p>
<p>Tony Twain declined to comment on this trade, staying silent throughout some media columns. Bystanders of the inner drama would not know how Twain was feeling after losing the successor to Ruud van Nistelrooy.</p>
<p>Should he be celebrating that a disobedient BAD_BOY has left, or should he be sad that four years of blood, sweat and tears are going down the drain?</p>
<p>Some guessed that this type of silence was proof of his sadness. After being betrayed by one of the players he valued the most, how could he not be sad?</p>
<p>Actually they were all wrong. Twain was currently worried about two important things that were making him frown constantly, how could he have the energy to be concerned about how the Danish kid was doing? So what if Bendtner left? Would the Earth stop rotating? Would Nottingham Forest would not win another championship? Would Tony Twain will stop drinking or smoking?</p>
<p>The midweek Super Cup, and the £30 million transfer fee that came with a priceless awkwardness — D*mn it, the transfer window will close very soon!</p>
<p>But to be honest, in the occasional lulls, he did think that the summer felt like a dream. Someone who was on his team listening to his teachings is now wearing a different club’s jersey, and the next time they meet, they meet as opponents.</p>
<p>Piqué, Bendtner… and those who left early. Anelka, Ashley Young, Arteta. What would they think of their years in Nottingham Forest? How would they evaluate him as a head coach?</p>
<p>Most of them probably would not have nice things to say right…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 679: Aerial Overlord</p>
<p>Maybe Allan realised that Nottingham Forest only had 3 official strikers, and that was why he allowed Twain to use the remaining transfer budget to buy a center forward from the market.</p>
<p>But the problem was not money, but that he could not find a player to recruit.</p>
<p>This type of situation was too depressing. It was like a penniless beggar drooling while watching someone else feast. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a big sum of money and happily made his way to the feast, only to be disappointed when he saw that the restaurant had closed for the day.</p>
<p>It was already August 31, which meant there was less than a day before the transfer window closed. At this point in time, many transfers had already been completed, and even the incomplete ones would have already been in the contract signing phase. Even if Twain could find a suitable target, the player might already have been owned. Half a day was not enough time for finding a new target from other clubs.</p>
<p>In his deepest thoughts, Twain determined that Man City did this intentionally. They held off the transfer till the last minute for the past few days to deny Nottingham Forest the time to find a replacement. However, Twain had only been concerned with arguing with Man City over the past few days that he forgotten this scenario.</p>
<p>Great, he dug his own grave.</p>
<p>On one hand, Twain was unwilling to give up and continued to search for a suitable candidate in the transfer market. On the other hand, he had also prepared himself to be content with a negative outcome. He decided to approach the youth team and the reserve team to see if there were any suitable forwards to use. Of course, this had to wait till the end of the Super Cup.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>When Tony Twain brought the Nottingham Forest team to Monaco to prepare for the UEFA Super Cup, the club members worked their hardest and put their all into the global region.</p>
<p>The Brazillian striker who was not bought by Man City was an option, but his complicated background and the pressing deadline made Nottingham Forest hesitate to take this player. Mario Gomez was the best scorer in the previous Bundesliga league and a powerful center forward, but his performance in the UEFA European Championships was so bad that the scouts in Nottingham Forest did not see much in him.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest searched for so long that they even approached the Spanish Valencia FC, using all their assets to get the opposing striker David Villa. They did not even care if this person’s personality was suited for the tactics in Nottingham Forest or if he was who Twain wanted.</p>
<p>Mario Balotelli, also known as “Super Mario” , a genius player from Milan, might have been suitable for the team. However, once Mourinho heard that it was Nottingham Forest who asked for him, he rejected the offer without hesitation.</p>
<p>The newly risen Egyptian center forward Zaki met Twain’s various requirements, but he had already been bought by Portsmouth. For a player who just transferred clubs in less than a month, it was impossible for Twain to make him transfer again.</p>
<p>At the most critical moment, the scouting team finally found the player that fulfilled all Twain’s demands.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Nikola Zigic, Serbian, 2 metres tall, and the second tallest center forwarding UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>In the UEFA Champions League, there had been a strange phenomenon in the past years where the taller the center forwards, the weaker their header skills. A classic example was Zlatan Ibrahimović, whose footwork was exponentially better than his heading.</p>
<p>However, Zigic was different. He met Twain’s expectations of a good center forward with great header skills. As a center forward, his header skills were as impressive as his build. Standing at 2.02 metres tall and weighing 100 kilograms, he was a real “Aerial Overlord” in the penalty area. During the match against Team Real Madrid, even the world-renowned Fabio Cannavaro did not know what to do against Zigic’s height and weight; not even fouling could bring this big kid down.</p>
<p>Also, impressive header skills did not mean his footwork was clumsy. Zigic’s shooting skills were equally good, indicating he truly was a well-rounded center forward.</p>
<p>What set him apart from Bendtner was that he had the potential to become a second passer who could create opportunities and selflessly set up plays for his team mates. The Siberian had better tactical discipline than Bendtner.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Zigic was not happy in Valencia.</p>
<p>In the previous season, Valencia spent a total of €107 million to bring him from Santander in Valencia, but he did not get to go on the field. Because he had missed a few matches in the early season due to injury, he had always been benched… More accurately, he was part of the audience.</p>
<p>Valencia’s main strikers were “Gourd Doll” David Villa and Fernando Morientes, and behind them were Angulo and Arizmendi. Whether it was Sánchez Flores or Koeman, neither wanted to risk anything with this tall center forward. Valencia spent 107 million on a fifth striker, so it was no wonder they had a debt crisis last season. No matter how rich they were, they should not have splurged.</p>
<p>This summer, Real Madrid wanted to snatch Zigic, but he personally rejected this suggestion because he wanted to prove himself in Valencia.</p>
<p>Following the opening of La Liga’s new season, Zigic found out the cruel truth — in the roster the new head coach Emery was planning to use, there was not a position for him as a center. David Villa decided to remain on the team at the last minute, which was as good as announcing that Zigic would not have the chance at fighting to be the starting center forward.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest, which had a lack of center forwards, appeared at this moment. Initially, the people from Nottingham Forest came to buy David Villa, but were disdainfully rejected by Valencia. They expressed that David Villa was not for sale. They did not even let go of him to Real Madrid, let alone Nottingham Forest which was far in England. Desperate, Nottingham Forest then incidentally did a quick scan on the strikers in Valencia and surprisingly discovered an unhappy and unsatisfied one.</p>
<p>Valencia was not willing to sell David Villa but they were indeed short of funds, so they were very open to selling other players. Zigic also realised he had no future if he stayed in Valencia, but Nottingham Forest was a team that recently won two championships, whose roster was filled with many players of high standards, and they were gunning for the championship. This aligned perfectly with Zigic’s wishes — he was hungry for reputation and results.</p>
<p>Both parties agreed without hesitation and signed the contract on the morning of September 1. Later that afternoon, Zigic flew to Nottingham and proceeded with his medical examination. At night, when Twain was at Monaco finishing his preparations and roster deployment for the match the next day, both Nottingham Forest and Valencia concurrently announced the transfer of Nikola Zugic into Nottingham Forest for a transfer fee of 10 million Euros. If not for the lack of time, Allen would have bargained for a lower price. Now that Valencia was lacking money, it was the perfect time to underpay them.</p>
<p>In the new season, Zigic would wear the number 9 jersey that Bentner passed down, becoming the new east striker in the contest.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain was very content with the transfer for Zigic; he felt that the last of his emotional burden had been removed. He spent too much time and effort on matters unrelated to him, and being able to obtain an “Aerial Overlord” at the final moments more or less made up for those regrets. Now he could concentrate on defeating their UEFA Super Cup opponents — the Glasgow Rangers from Scotland.</p>
<p>In last season’s finals, Glasgow Rangers defeated the veteran Bayern Munich in a close fight, winning the Europa Cup. Naturally, they would hope to be as lucky in the Super Cup. And Twain, without his strong center forward, had no choice but to deploy a defensive formation, relying on occasional surprise attacks to threaten a goal, but most of the time Nottingham Forest players were exhausted from running while defending.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Nottingham Forest did not have a ” UEFA Champions” stance. The Glasgow Rangers, with their high morale, seemed more like the winners of the UEFA Champions league.</p>
<p>But what happened in the end?</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest successfully defended till the penalty kick at the end. At this time, Glasgow Rangers, who were wildly attacking for one hundred and twenty minutes were both frustrated and exhausted — they never thought a Super Cup match would delay till the penalty kick. In contrast, the Nottingham Forest players, who were constantly being dominated in the main match were all super confident and calm, as if the penalty kick was something they had predicted from the start. The final psychological test of penalty kick had not even started but there was already a clear winner between the mentalities of both parties.</p>
<p>During the penalty, the first player on the field from the Glasgow Rangers was Kevin Thompson who, under large pressure, sent the ball into the stands, giving Nottingham Forest a great start. Following that, Nottingham Forest scored all 4 goals while Glasgow Rangers only scored two. They had already lost before even taking the fifth shot.</p>
<p>After Nottingham Forest followed up against Serie A giants AC Milan, they became the second team to successfully defend the European Super cup. Winning the second champion trophy in the new season brought some happiness to the team that recently sold their future superstar.</p>
<p>Though it was a messy situation, they still won. Once again, they proved to people a truth that they were unwilling to admit but they had to, which was “defending will forever be the basis of winning the championship.”</p>
<p>And so the experts started to predict boldly —”This season, Nottingham Forest’s brilliance will continue!”</p>
<p>These experts, after assessing three league seasons, concluded with a piece of advice: Do not be afraid to talk big about Nottingham Forest. This is because Twain will talk big every year, but always ends up the victor. Questioning him only will result in being lightly slapped by him at the end, so why not just talk big? If you somehow are right, you can claim to be far-sighted, and even if you are wrong, you can push the blame to Twain and his team for not being capable enough.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Despite winning the Super Cup and purchasing the tall center forward Zigic, Twain did not have any signs of relaxing one bit. This reason was simple — someone got injured again. Van der Vaart and van Nistelrooy, who were still among those injured, gained a new buddy after the Super Cup match.</p>
<p>Pepe sprained his ankle during extra time, and at that time Twain had no reserves under his name, so he could only sit and wait. After the match and the check-ups, it was decided that Pepe needed to rest for 15 days. Now Twain could only celebrate that it was not a major injury, or else this start to the new league season was really unfavourable for the year.</p>
<p>After returning to Nottingham, Twain introduced Zigic before making time to speak to him individually, with the help of translation. He told Zigic about the type of team Nottingham Forest was, the style of football the main coach specialised in, the effects he hoped for the center forward to have on the plays, and the position he held in this team. At the same time, he showed some concern for Zigic’s life in England, telling the latter to approach him if ever he felt uncomfortable. Twain was the perfect portrait of a benevolent, gentle and kind middle-aged man.</p>
<p>After the Super Cup, Nottingham Forest temporarily disbanded. Some players, as part of their national duty, had to return to play for their respective countries in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers.</p>
<p>Famous Italian gold medallist Fabio Capello had already taken over as England’s new head coach, and because of this iron coach, George Wood was reselected for England’s representative team. His steady display, faithful execution of tactics and calm personality corresponded to the wants of Capello.</p>
<p>The media predicted that, during this match where England would challenge Andorra on their home ground, Wood would be welcomed into the starting lineup. The young Nottingham Forest team leader still had to prove his value to the England team. Previously, he was deemed to be undervalued by the previous two head coaches.</p>
<p>Wood needed to work hard for his future in the England team but Twain was not slacking off either. Taking advantage of this, he took a trip to the reserve teams and the youth teams. He might have bought Zigic, but Nistelrooy was getting older, and no matter how good his condition was, there was no guarantee that he could maintain this in the next season… Realistically, it was difficult to even guarantee he could maintain his game for this season. Twain felt it was better to scout for his reserves.</p>
<p>Although the first team was on a break, the reserve teams still had to prepare for the Premier Reserve League match this weekend. Twain’s arrival made the players on the reserve team extremely happy because they knew what the rare trips of the head coach meant. If they performed well, they had a chance to be promoted to the first team.</p>
<p>Turkish genius Sahin was following the first team to training, but joining the reserve team for competition. Twain hoped that, through this match, he could start coming in contact and familiarising with England’s soccer style, and at the same time gradually improve his confidence and afflatus. He was also here to also watch how Sahin was performing.</p>
<p>Upon seeing Twain, the head coach of the reserve team, Colin Clarkwood, thought he was coming specifically to inspect Sahin. The moment they met, he prattled on about Sahin’s performance. “Tony, this guy is indeed a genius. His performance in the reserve team competition was very outstanding. I think he already possesses the capability to fight in the first team. His passing was very creative, and his ball handling is extraordinary…”</p>
<p>Twain listened patiently to his introduction and nodded. “Let him stay under your guidance for a while, Colin.”</p>
<p>“What? Isn’t Rafael injured?” asked Colin Clarkwood, seemingly very puzzled.</p>
<p>“There are so many people on the first team, I have to try to make sure they all go on the field.” Twain smiled helplessly.</p>
<p>Colin Clarkwood realised everything, and shook his head with a laugh. “No one wants to play as a substitute.Also, I heard the suggestions of the psychologists. Miss Taretha, the one who has been treating Sahin, felt that now is not a great time for him to return to the first team. I trust the professionals, so let’s just let him wait for now… Is he unhappy with anything?” What Twain cared about was that final question. Bendtner’s departure was a wake up call; he had to stop thinking that people were just obedient NPCs without any personal desires.</p>
<p>Colin Clarkwood shook his head. “That he does not have. In fact… I feel that he really enjoys these type of matches without pressure.”</p>
<p>Twain replied with an “oh” and stopped talking. He continued watching the internal friendly match of the reserve team on the training field. This friendly match would determine the roster for the reserve team competition tomorrow, so everyone was doing their best. They all wanted to show off their best selves in front of the head coach of the first team.</p>
<p>The few players who had the best prospects were all on loan, such as wing players like Adriano Moke. Players from the first team who had no national duty appeared in the reserve team as well; if they played well, they would participate in the preliminary match tomorrow. In reality, the reserve team was always a platform to calibrate the first team players’ states and to observe their standards. Twain rarely came and that was not because he was not concerned but because he had eyes here — Dunn. Dunn was always present for every reserve team match. Those guaranteed to be out of the roster of the first team in the league season would also come to prepare for the reserve team match to maintain their condition, and players who recently recovered would also rediscover their competitive tempo from the reserve team match. Another type would be a young man full of prospects like Colin, who would use the reserve team match to convince the head coach of the first team, and use the reserve team as a jumping block to rise to the first team and onto a greater stage.</p>
<p>However, these people were just passers-by in the reserve team. Those who stayed in the reserve team were mostly the less outstanding players who drew a low pay and were unable to compete in the first team, so being able to compete in the reserve team was sufficient for them. Every summer, the club would terminate their contract with such players or sell them off to lower grade teams at a low price, then pick another batch from the youth team to inspect at a closer distance. Those with potential would then stay or be loaned out to train and those without prospects would be fired after a few years, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Twain quickly noticed the center back on the yellow team because he was simply too tall. Twain gauged him to be at least 1.9 meters tall, since he was taller than the goalkeeper. He felt that this person looked familiar, maybe it was because he was unusually tall. He turned his head to ask Colin Clarkwood. “Who is this number 5?”</p>
<p>“Aaron Mitchell, center back. However, his performance in this position is horrible.” Colin Clarkwood is a dedicated reserve team head coach, remembering the players that Twain could not recognise.</p>
<p>“How horrible is he?” Twain then recalled this name. He remembered that he noticed this big guy last summer when he went to the youth team to look for possible future stars.</p>
<p>“Lacks defensive knowledge.” Colin Clarkwood shakes his head. “Header has improved, body build is excellent. However, when he is defending he has no idea what he is doing. Watch.”</p>
<p>While speaking, Mitchell was juked by Hoyt, another striker in the reserve team, which led to a successful goal.</p>
<p>“Besides, his sliding tackle is lousy, and because of this, I had no choice but to prevent him from slide-tackling his opponent in the penalty area. In three matches he has already given his opponents 2 penalty kicks. He is always so easily juked which leads to him losing his center of gravity.”</p>
<p>The side without vests was celebrating the goal while the culprit who lost the ball was looking on the ground at the same spot being upset. Twain snuck a few more looks, then lowered his head. This kid was really tall, almost as tall as Zigic? Twain suddenly realised something.</p>
<p>“Perhaps he doesn’t suit this position, Colin. Try placing him onto the front line?” Twain told Colin.</p>
<p>The head coach of the reserve team was shocked by Twain’s ridiculous thought. “Forward? This…”</p>
<p>Seeing how he looked troubled, Twain smiled. “Fine, call him out, let me talk to him.”</p>
<p>Colin Clarkwood blew his whistle to stop the match, then signalled that silly big guy from the field to come over. His teammates looked shocked; they could not understand why Twain would fancy Mitchell when he had just made a mistake.</p>
<p>“Head coach, b-boss.” He greeted Colin Clarkwood first, stuttering a little when he faced a smiling Twain.</p>
<p>“Little guy, how tall are you?” Twain nodded as an acknowledgement, then asked.</p>
<p>“Uh…1.9 meters.”</p>
<p>Twain chuckled, “no wonder you look so tall, you are even taller than him…” Twain pointed at the other goalkeeper, Mitchell’s opponent who was wearing number 3. Dale Roberts,1.91 meters tall.</p>
<p>“Honestly speaking, your performance is terrible.”</p>
<p>Hearing what Twain said, he fell completely silent instantly, lowering his head like a student facing his punishment.</p>
<p>“Now, I am giving you a chance. Go play striker.”</p>
<p>Hearing what Twain said, Mitchell became stunned. He raised his head in confusion to look towards the other who was shorter than him.</p>
<p>“Me, but I have never, never ever…”</p>
<p>“I am telling to play that role, so go do it, what is with all the nonsense!” Twain furrowed his eyebrows and Mitchell turned silent.</p>
<p>“Run along.” Colin Clarkson patted his shoulder and pushed him back into the field. Then, he pulled back the defensive midfielder to temporarily become the center back, changing the formation into a 4-3-3.</p>
<p>“Let them cross the ball more from the sides and pass high balls.”</p>
<p>Colin Clarkwood understood Twain’s intentions. “You want to see the kid’s header skills?”</p>
<p>“I want to see him score with a header.” Twain smiled while correcting his colleague’s mistake.</p>
<p>Until the end of the first half, Mitchell did not score once in his first time at the striker line. Initially, he was super nervous, not understanding why the head coach wanted him to be striker left him at a loss for words. However, when he discovered his teammates were always trying to cross high balls into the penalty area, he tried to do a header. He realised that, once he jumped, the opposing defenders could not do anything to him, so completely calmed down and focused on how to head the ball into the goal.</p>
<p>Although he did not score, he did hit the goal post twice, and there was one time where he forced the first team goalkeeper Dale Roberts to make a desperate dive — in order to save his left bottom corner header, Roberts almost hit the goal post.</p>
<p>Once his teammates discovered that Mitchell, who had nothing to offer but his height, had such a good function, they proactively passed high balls to him, immediately sounding the violent aerial alarm in front of the goal post of Roberts. Whether or not he could head the ball, such a huge figure such as Mitchell standing in front of the goal would put huge psychological pressure for the opposing defenders. His presence also aided in distracting the opposition for his teams, allowing the yellow team to even the score before the end of the first half. When Sahin appeared in front of the goal to score, he had no defenders near him at all — everyone was near Mitchell.</p>
<p>Witnessing such a scene, Twain beamed while applauding, on one hand approving Sahin’s goal, on the other hand telling the stunned Colin Clarkwood, “Looks like we both got his position wrong. He should have been a center forward. From now on, train him as a center forward.”</p>
<p>Hence, Aaron Mitchell, who started soccer when he was 10, who was a goalkeeper for a year and a center back for 7, officially changed his role to become an alternate center forward. Chelsea’s “Monster” center forward Drogba also switched from a center back to a center forward. Maybe Mitchell could not become the first Drogba but at least he could start working towards this goal.</p>

<p>Chapter 680: Forty and Confused</p>
<p>George Wood made the starting lineup in the England against FC Andorra game and performed remarkably. When he was brought off the field in the 80th minute, it was no longer a problem for England to win the game with a two-goal lead. So Capello felt assured to bring him off—with him on the pitch, England’s rear defensive line was indeed more solid. It was not just the defense that benefitted. England’s offense was more threatening because of him. After all, all the attacks started from the midfield. Capello had Wood alone in charge of the defense in this game and everyone else attacked. As for the “three midfielders”, Capello did not use England’s most accustomed 4-4-2 formation in this game, but instead they played 4-3-3. George Wood alone was pulled to the back to defend, with Gerrard and Lampard both at the front, between the attacking midfielder and the shadow striker. This maximized their offensive abilities without distracting them with the defense.</p>
<p>However, the problem of the offensive core remained unresolved. Gerrard and Lampard were very capable attacking players and also took on the roles of playmakers in their respective clubs. But who would be at England’s playmaker?</p>
<p>Although in the computer domain, dual-core CPUs were more powerful than a single-core, they could not be comprehended so easily on the football field. After all, people were not computers. One more core playmaker might lead to interference with each other, and eventually no one could play well. Like the current Brazil national team today, Dunga was having a headache over how Kaka and Ronaldinho could coexist on the pitch.</p>
<p>If Gerrard was the playmaker, then Lampard’s play would be limited; If Lampard was the playmaker, then Gerrard could not play to his best level.</p>
<p>England’s 2-0 win over Andorra was not directly related to Gerrard’s or Lampard’s excellent play. Both goals were scored from set pieces. George Wood’s appearance only strengthened England’s defense and had not made much of a direct contribution to the offense.</p>
<p>After this match, the England players would remain in the national team to prepare for the September 11th qualifiers. Capello still had time to adjust his lineup tactics.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The First Team had no competition. Twain had been immersed in the reserve team during this period, overseeing the training and competition of the players who had no national team responsibilities for the Premier Reserve League.</p>
<p>Aaron Mitchell was training hard and adapting to the new position as a center forward. He progressed very slowly in the beginning. After all, he played as a full back for seven years and some habits were not that easy to change. The difference between a full back and a striker was also very large. Changing positions was not simply as easy as changing the name. A lot of knowledge was involved. Mitchell could only slowly explore and experience on his own.</p>
<p>Şahin’s progress had also pleased Twain. With the help of the psychiatrists and coaches, he was trying not to shy away from the physical confrontations on the pitch. At first he was a little nervous and scared, but he did it in the end. Twain decided to let Şahin play in the EFL Cup for the Forest team next month. If Şahin could successfully return to his pre-injury level, the Turkish Football Federation should really send a pennant to Twain and Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>At the end of the training session, Twain would sometimes invite Kerslake and Dunn to hang out and have a drink together at Burns’ bar—Dunn certainly only drank non-alcoholic beverages. He would chat with Fat John, Skinny Bill and the gang, and then head home with Dunn.</p>
<p>Life was simple.</p>
<p>However, if he did not keep busy or not have drinks and be with friends, Twain would still feel a little lonely. The house was not considered small and there was no one else most of the time. Every night before he went to bed or head to the bathroom to take a leak, he would have to pass by Shania’s room. Sometimes he would suddenly stop to look inside.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Hey, Tony. Would you like to go have a drink tonight?” After the training, Kerslake hailed Twain warmly. Dunn looked at him too.</p>
<p>Twain unexpectedly shook his head and declined this time. “I’ve got something on. I can’t go. You guys go ahead.”</p>
<p>Kerslake looked at Dunn and was about to open his mouth when Dunn spoke first, “Since that’s the case, I will go straight home.” He had no interest in bars. He only used to go because Twain wanted to go, and they could have a chat together. Since Twain did not want to go today, there was no need for him to go to places he did not like very much.</p>
<p>Kerslake sighed helplessly, “All right. Since you’re not going, what am I going to do there by myself?”</p>
<p>Twain chuckled, “You’d better go home and spend time with your wife, David! A family man shouldn’t go to the bar all the time.”</p>
<p>Kerslake gave a shrug and left. Twain looked at Dunn, “You should head back too.”</p>
<p>Dunn nodded and turned to walk away without asking Twain about his plans.</p>
<p>What was Twain’s plans? Actually, he was still going to have a drink, but in another environment. He did not want to go to Burns’ bar today, where there were too many acquaintances. Someone would always come talk to him with a drink. He would not be idle for a minute.</p>
<p>Why did he suddenly decide to drink in a different bar? Because he suddenly remembered that tomorrow was his birthday, Tony Twain’s birthday.</p>
<p>He had been in England for almost five years, and he had never celebrated a birthday. The first year was because he did not remember the birthday of the body’s owner. His memory breaks for that year was rather serious and he could not remember many things. Now he remembered some and still could not recall the other stuff. However, those were very long-term memories and did not affect him much if he did not recall. In the latter three years, he knew Tony Twain’s birthday was on September 9th, but he did not bother. On the one hand, it was someone else’s birthday. On the other hand, he was always very busy. When he did remember the birthday, the timing often would have already passed. Over time, he was too lazy to think about such meaning things like birthdays.</p>
<p>Not everyone took birthdays seriously. Twain remembered that he previously was not concerned with such matters. His parents would take care of it when he was still living at home. While he was alone in other cities for his studies and work, he never celebrated his birthday—he had few friends and it was too silly to buy a cake and blow candles on his own. He just have to remember the date and year of his own birth date. There was no need to do so many fancy things.</p>
<p>He guessed that Dunn and he were the kind of people who did not care about birthdays, because he did not see Dunn celebrate his birthday once since he came to Nottingham. By the way, Dunn’s birthday was on August 8th, which was already over. It coincided with the Olympic Games opening. Twain had even joked at the time that his birthday party was even directed by the director Zhang Yimou. Dunn did not respond to this, which made Twain felt that he had told a corny joke again.</p>
<p>But this year, Twain, who did not care about his birthday, suddenly thought of his birthday.</p>
<p>Because he suddenly remembered that come tomorrow, this body of his would be forty years old…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Forty years old!</p>
<p>It was a scary age.</p>
<p>Twain was still thinking about the problem when he sat and drank alone in a bar in downtown Nottingham city, which he had never been to.</p>
<p>He had never cared about his age before. It could even be said that he had always felt that after he had transmigrated here, his age should start from the age of twenty-six years old. In that case, he was only thirty-one years old this year. There were still a lot of young people who had not married at this age in China.</p>
<p>The reality was cruel. He could feel his body slowly aging now, which was a natural pattern and could not be stopped. He also could not turn a blind eye to it. Although in the football world, the media and others still addressed him as “a young manager” and said he was “young and promising”, football was a special world. Here, a 30-year-old player was termed as “a veteran.”</p>
<p>Forty years old was really old.</p>
<p>As the Chinese saying went: At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts.</p>
<p>A thirty-year-old person should have settled down and established his career. He was now forty years old and still alone—from now on he must see himself as a person who had truly been lived for forty years.</p>
<p>He felt he should seriously think about “a family.”</p>
<p>The messy bachelor’s room needed to be cleaned up. He could not always get a quick meal at Burns’ bar after work. Masturbation and call girls could not accompany a person for life … Most importantly, he was not a celibate, a homosexual, frigid, never been hurt by a woman when he was young, psychopath, a hardcore member of the “anti-society and romance squad”, felt animosity toward society, women and family. Then he had nowhere to settle this lonesome heart of his. In the still of the night, he would also feel unbearable.</p>
<p>Recently while they were having drinks, Kerslake would always looked at his watch when it was time. Then he would jabbered on and complained about how his wide would nag if he went home late. While he talked about how “he can’t drink to his heart’s content because there will be trouble with a woman at home”, he would obediently bid farewell to Twain and rushed home to accompany his wife.</p>
<p>Twain asked Dunn before. Did Kerslake want to stay and have a few more drinks, or did he really want to go back to spend time with his wife?</p>
<p>Dunn thought about it and shook his head to say he did not know.</p>
<p>He reckoned that he was unable to understand the feeling without a family.</p>
<p>At the thought of a family, Twain felt even more troubled. He downed mouthfuls of golden-colored alcohol into his mouth.</p>
<p>Because he realized that his social circle was pathetically small. Apart from football, it was more football. He used to think there was nothing wrong with it. It was the life he wanted. Now when he wanted to find a woman in his social circle whom he could have an affinity and to spend his life with, he could not find her—99.9% percent of people in his life were men.</p>
<p>In fact, Dunn was like him, but Dunn was still young and had just turned twenty-seven years old. His future was long. He had plenty of time to plan his life and meet the person he liked. For the first time, Twain felt his time was tight. Ten years’ time would fly by and he would be fifty years old then, half a century old… Previously he had no concept of this age. Now that he thought about it, he would feel the chill down his spine.</p>
<p>How could there be a woman who would like a forty-year-old middle-aged man with an eccentric character and unlikable temperament?</p>
<p>It was a lively bar here, not because there was a lot of people chatting loudly, but because of the loud music and young men and women having a crazy time together. It was not a traditional pub but a younger and more stylish version, similar to a club.</p>
<p>Twain came here randomly. He did not like this kind of noisy music, which did not sound as moving as the songs in the City Ground stadium’s grandstand to his ears. But he could bring himself to a state whereby he could be completely deaf to the music and noise. He just sat alone in the corner, downing one drink after another. He was bothered by some things and when he was troubled, he would drink until he was drunk, and the trouble would naturally be gone.</p>
<p>In his state, he still managed to attract someone’s attention in another corner.</p>
<p>“May I sit here?” A female voice rang out beside Twain’s ear.</p>
<p>Twain looked at the other person. It was a woman with brown hair and fair skin, holding a wine glass and smiling as she sat in front of him. He could not make out her features clearly, because he was intoxicated and blurry-eyed.</p>
<p>He was no stranger to such an opening line, which he often encountered on some occasions. The other parties would be prettily and sexily dressed women. They would sit down with a smile as one invited them to a drink, and then one could do whatever he wanted…</p>
<p>Twain was not in the mood now. He did not come to this unfamiliar bar to take care of his physical needs. But when he saw the other party’s brown hair, he hesitated and changed his mind.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you already seated here, miss?”</p>
<p>The woman smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re so beautiful, miss.” It was a false compliment, and an instinctive reflex of sorts. Twain would say this when he met a woman who made the first move. Now he simply could not make out the other person’s appearance as he had too much to drink and also because of the dim lighting. What caught his eye was a sea of dazzling white—the other person wore little clothes.</p>
<p>“Is anything the matter, beautiful lady?”</p>
<p>“I’m curious about you. Is that ok?” The woman laughed.</p>
<p>“It counts as a reason too.” Twain nodded, then squinted his eyes as he stared at the other person and asked, “But do you know who I am?”</p>
<p>The woman looked around. Men and women were still partying to the explosive music.</p>
<p>“What does your identity have to do with the two of us on a night like this?”</p>
<p>The two people looked at each other and smiled. Ah, there was mutual understanding…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The sound of a car engine stalling came from the street outside the house. After a while, the sound of an open lock rang in the dark house and the front door was opened. The light from the streetlights outside shone in, and two long figures appeared at the door.</p>
<p>“This is my place. It’s a little messy… hope you don’t mind, ha.” Twain slurred as he pointed inside the door to the woman he was hugging. “You know, this is true of a single middle-aged man…”</p>
<p>Twain threw off the leather shoes on his feet and began to feel around in the dark to turn on the lights.</p>
<p>When he had just turned on the lights, another familiar voice suddenly rang out behind him.</p>
<p>“You have such a colorful nightlife, Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>Twain turned his head around in amazement, and found his Shania standing on the stairs, coldly overlooking him, as well as the beautifully and fashionably dressed woman he met at the bar in his arms…</p>
<p>This was a strange scene. Twain thought he had drunk too much and was seeing and hearing things. He looked at Shania and turned to look at the woman from the bar next to him who was confused about what had suddenly happened.</p>
<p>He felt that his brain which had been anaesthetized by alcohol was a little slow.</p>
<p>“Oh…. what’s … going on…?” After a while, he blurted out this sentence.</p>
<p>“It looks like you’re doing well by yourself. I’m relieved by this. Goodbye, Uncle Tony. Also, it’s just after midnight, happy birthday.” Shania took a backpack from the room and walked down. She waved her hand at the two people with a cool expression and went straight out of the door. Soon the sound of a car starting was heard, and then a white Mercedes Jeep drove past Twain’s door.</p>
<p>“She, she is…” The woman pointed to Shania who walked away, somewhat surprised and puzzled.</p>
<p>The cold wind outside the door blew in, and there was a layer of sweat on Twain’s forehead—He had sobered up.</p>
<p>Shania specially came back from overseas. It was just that…how did it happen like this?</p>
<p>This time, the woman looked at Twain with an even more surprised and puzzled expression. Twain realized that he was still hugging the other person till now. He hurriedly let go and said, “I’m sorry, so sorry… I don’t know what happened. But I can’t tonight…” As he spoke, he pulled out a few bills in his wallet and handed them to her.</p>
<p>The woman saw Twain’s action and her face turned cold. She looked at Twain and spoke in a completely different tone from the one she used to chat at the bar, “I think you’re mistaken. I’m not a prostitute, Mr. Tony Twain.”</p>
<p>Having said that, the woman turned around and left Twain’s house. Like Shania, she drove off.</p>
<p>At this time, Dunn, who heard the movements next door, came over. When he entered the house, he found that it was empty except for Twain standing alone at the door, in a daze as if he were a pillar.</p>
<p>“What happened? Where’s Shania?”</p>
<p>Twain turned to look at him, “You knew? Did you see her?”</p>
<p>“As soon as I came back, I saw the lights up at your place. I came over to take a look out of curiosity. I did not expect Shania to come back. I had wanted to call you and ask you to come home. But she said she wanted to surprise you, and did not let me call… She specially came back for your birthday and said she wanted to give you a birthday present… By the way, where’s she?” As he spoke, Dunn looked around to find Shania.</p>
<p>“Stop looking. She left.” Twain sat on the couch with his hands covering his face as he rubbed vigorously. He tried to sober himself up.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Dunn also felt that the mood was wrong at this time.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” Twain spread his hands and said, “Simply put, I went out for a drink and brought back a woman. Then I saw Shania. Following which, Shania left, and the woman left soon after when I tried to give her money.”</p>
<p>Dunn looked oddly at Twain and asked, “How much did you have to drink, Tony?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I didn’t count.”</p>
<p>Dunn sighed and sat down next to Twain, muttering, “This is why I hate drinking…”</p>
<p>The two men sat silently on the couch. The door was still opened and the wind outside was blowing in, making them feel a little cold.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 681 - Jealous</p>
<p>In the middle of the night the day after, Twain called Shania for almost the entire night. At first no one answered, and then it was simply—“Sorry the number you have dialed is not in service.”</p>
<p>Twain was sure he had made Shania angry, but Twain was a little confused as to how he made her angry.</p>
<p>Was it because I brought a woman home? But Uncle Tony also wants to have his own life…</p>
<p>Well, if she hates the way I bring prostitutes home… I really should apologize.</p>
<p>Twain waited apprehensively with bloodshot eyes until the next morning.</p>
<p>in accordance with his bad habit, which had been criticized many times by Shania and remained unchanged, Twain read the latest newspapers while he ate breakfast.</p>
<p>He flipped open a tabloid focused on gossip of the stars. He sprayed the coffee that he had just drank all onto the papers. Not only did he choke and cough forcefully, he also coughed till he perspired. His shirt was drenched.</p>
<p>He looked too unseemly. If called Shania were to see, she definitely would have more reason to prohibit Twain from reading the newspapers during mealtimes.</p>
<p>The reason for Twain’s unseemly appearance was a front-page story.</p>
<p>[The Staggering Secret Girlfriend of the Famous Premier League Manager Tony Twain!!]</p>
<p>Then a large image under the headline almost took up half of the first page of the edition. It was pieced together by two photographs. On the left, it was a photograph of Tony Twain in an interview, and on the right, it was…Shania dressed as a model on the runway!</p>
<p>How could Twain not spray the coffee?</p>
<p>He immediately went to find out who was the bastard who wrote the damn news. Underneath the “our newspaper’s reporters”, he saw a photograph and a name.</p>
<p>Lisa Aria.</p>
<p>In the photo next to the name was her frameless headshot: curly brown hair, fair complexion, and freckles on her face. Twain felt somewhat familiar with the face.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered that yesterday while he was getting drunk in the bar, a woman came on to him. He eventually brought her home, only to anger Shania and caused her to leave. It was this woman!</p>
<p>He swore a foul word. Ah, you’re the culprit, the one who caused all this trouble. I’m already giving you face by not looking for you to settle the accounts. I did not expect you start a rumor about me!</p>
<p>Recalling how she left her telephone number yesterday while they chatted happily, Twain pulled out his cell phone and found the new name “Lisa” in the contacts. He was certain that this was the number left yesterday, so he dialed the number.</p>
<p>The call was picked up quickly, and a female voice came on. Except for a slightly different tone, it was the voice that Twain had heard last night.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tony Twain, I knew you’d call me.” There was none of the flirtatiousness from last night, but with an added chilliness.</p>
<p>“Just my luck to have gone out to relieve boredom only to encounter a reporter.” Twain said with gritted teeth.</p>
<p>“I said I’m not a prostitute.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I said ‘reporter.’ I’m so glad now that we didn’t sleep together in the end. Otherwise I don’t know what other shocking things you’re going to write about.”</p>
<p>“I think you misunderstood one thing. I’m not the kind of reporter who uses her body to hook up with celebrities for sensational news. Mr. Tony Twain.” Despite Twain’s uncivil tone, Lisa Aria kept calm and did not get angry.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t care what you do. I need you to take this piece of news down right away and then issue a public apology to me and Miss Judy Shania Jordana in the same placement!”</p>
<p>“Apology? Why?”</p>
<p>“Why? Because you violated my and her reputation rights!”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, Mr. Twain. Is it a shameful thing to admit that you’re both in love?”</p>
<p>“Miss Lisa Aria…” Twain was about to explode.</p>
<p>At this time, the other party said, “I think a lot of words can’t be clarified over the phone. The best is for us to meet face to face.”</p>
<p>“That won’t do. I still need to work.”</p>
<p>“When do you start work?”</p>
<p>“Nine o’clock…”</p>
<p>“Perfect, it’s half past seven now. I promise I won’t take up too much of your time. I know where you live. I’ll drive over. See you in twenty-five minutes, Mr. Twain.” After saying that, she hung up the phone before Twain could refuse, and individually confirmed the meeting.</p>
<p>“Hey…” Twain was helpless.</p>
<p>At this time, he had time to calm down and see what was written on the news.</p>
<p>In fact, the article was very difficult to write. Because the reporter was one of the parties involved. She had gone home with Twain. The readers were adults, and no one was stupid enough to think that a single man and a single woman would go home together to discuss about life and ideals. A Premier League manager and an entertainment gossip female reporter got together for a one-night stand? The news itself was explosive enough.</p>
<p>As a result, Lisa Aria basically did not mention the seduction in the bar. She only mentioned that she met Twain in the bar and followed him home. From there, she discovered the “a golden house to keep one’s mistress” fact—in Tony Twain’s house was the international supermodel who was currently building her film and television career in Hollywood, Judy Shania Jordana!</p>
<p>Although everyone knew that Jordana and Twain had a personal relationship, some people thought it was due to the Beckhams’, or that they were just ordinary friends. No one thought in the direction of the “romance department.” After all, the age gap between them was too wide. Furthermore, there was a rumor that Tony Twain was actually “gay” and only interested in men. For example, he was very close with his Chinese assistant manager, so close that it was enough for people to generate plenty of associations. Several gay magazines in the United Kingdom had fantasized about Tony Twain.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that Twain and Shania are having an affair!</p>
<p>The news was really shocking. Unfortunately, because the reporter herself was just on a night out to have fun, she did not carry a camera and could not provide any photographic evidence in kind to prove her words. But she was willing to use her integrity to assure her that she did see Shania show up at Twain’s home, and that the two people seemed to have a fight, in which Shania then angrily slammed the door and left.</p>
<p>Twain simply did not know whether to laugh or cry seeing such an article. On more than one occasion, he had gotten a taste of the English tabloids’ ability to distort the truth deliberately, invert right and wrong, and make up stories. But each time it would make him think that these people were too powerful. A single mouthpiece could create so many disturbances.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The second meeting with Lisa Aria came twenty-five minutes later as she had said.</p>
<p>Seeing the woman again, she had taken off her stylish and sexy revealing outfit and put on a plain professional attire. She even wore a pair of black-framed glasses on her nose, appearing to be very capable.</p>
<p>When he saw Lisa Aria coming out of her car at the door, Twain shook his head, “Women are such chameleons.”</p>
<p>“It could have been a beautiful chance encounter last night, Mr. Twain.” Aria laughed. Only her smile was the same as yesterday.</p>
<p>“Sure, a Premier League manager and a female reporter, two people sleeping together. The news would be so hot.” Although he did not welcome her, Twain still let the lady into the house out of politeness.</p>
<p>“You’re deeply prejudiced about the news media, Mr. Twain. I’m not the kind of reporter who likes to be the main story of the news. Have you read the news? I lied.” She was referring to the chance encounter with Twain.</p>
<p>“You told more than one lie. Let’s talk properly, Miss Aria. I think your article is pure fabrication.” Twain threw the newspaper in front of the other person. But he was a little embarrassed by the coffee stains on it.</p>
<p>Aria was a smart woman. She looked at the newspaper and glanced at the slightly uncomfortable Twain. Then she laughed, “Looks like Mr. Twain’s breakfast was on this?”</p>
<p>Twain cleared his throat and said, “Let’s get back to the point. I think you fabricated a horrible rumor…”</p>
<p>Aria took off her black-framed glasses and slightly narrowed her eyes, “Mr. Twain, there are only two of us here, so don’t pretend.”</p>
<p>“Pretend? I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think everything I saw in this room last night was an illusion. You might have drunk too much, but I definitely did not.”</p>
<p>Twain stared at the woman for a moment and said, “Okay. I’m telling the truth, too. There’s nothing going on with Shania and me. We’re just friends…”</p>
<p>“Liar.” Aria smiled and said, “The excuse is too clumsy.”</p>
<p>“Why should I lie to you?” Twain raised his voice.</p>
<p>“How would I know?” Aria shrugged and said, “Maybe you just don’t want the swarming media to disturb your sweet life together… Anyhow, you’re pretty good to have covered this up so tightly, Mr. Twain.”</p>
<p>“I take you very seriously, Miss Lisa Aria. Shania and I are just good friends, despite our age difference. You know? Our relationship is definitely not what you think!”</p>
<p>Aria did not answer immediately this time but looked strangely at Twain for a moment. “The media all say Tony Twain is a mystery, and it is true. I’m also serious about discussing it with you. If you’re still worried, I can swear that anything we talk about today won’t appear in any media.” She raised her hand and swore solemnly. “Are you still going to lie to me?”</p>
<p>Twain completely could not get angry now because he felt that this was not an issue that could be solved by being angry—he was utterly unable to communicate with the other person. “Why should I deceive you? Like you said, is it a shame to admit that we love each other? But the problem is that there’s really nothing going between her and me…”</p>
<p>“Why is she at your house?”</p>
<p>“Today is my birthday, so she came to wish me a happy birthday. It’s normal for friends to do this, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“If you’re friends, why did she get angry when she saw us together? She can’t control your life, can she?”</p>
<p>“Not everyone can accept that their own friends bring prostitutes home to do those things….”</p>
<p>Aria went red in the face and interrupted Twain’s words, “Mr. Twain…”</p>
<p>Twain also interrupted her, “It’s just that she thought you were a prostitute. I’m not saying you’re a prostitute.”</p>
<p>Aria felt frustrated for a moment and found that she could not rebut Twain’s words, because what Twain said was reasonable. So, she habitually went to push up her glasses, but her fingers found an empty space instead. She went redder in the face. “Well, just… suppose I’m a prostitute… She has no right to interfere with your freedom as a friend.”</p>
<p>“She should still have the right to be angry.”</p>
<p>“Was she angry?” Aria suddenly was not red in the face anymore. She laughed this time.</p>
<p>Twain was puzzled by her laughter.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Do you understand women, Mr. Twain?” Instead of answering Twain, Aria asked such a question instead.</p>
<p>Twain stared blankly. He did not know what the question meant. “I don’t know if I understand women, but I’m sure I understand Shania more than you do.”</p>
<p>“Not necessarily, Mr. Twain. Don’t assume that just because you know her for a long time means that you understand her. Are you sure that you understand everyone around you?”</p>
<p>Aria’s words struck Twain’s Achilles’ heel. Because he thought of Bendtner who was leaving. He thought he knew Bendtner well and understood everyone on the team, that he knew what they liked, hated and wanted… But in actual fact? He overlooked the most important things and still felt regret till now.</p>
<p>Seeing that Twain did not say a word, Aria sensed that she had pinpointed Twain’s worry— indeed she had spoken accurately, but the “worry” was not “a matter of the heart.”</p>
<p>She smugly declared her victory, “Please forgive my bluntness, Mr. Twain. Last night, your very good friend was not angry, but … jealous.”</p>
<p>Like being struck by a thunderbolt, Twain sat dazedly in his chair and did not react even until Lisa Aria said goodbye.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Feeling preoccupied, Twain rushed to Wilford and then greeted Kerslake, “Good morning, Dunn.”</p>
<p>“…” Kerslake looked at Dunn standing next to Twain.</p>
<p>Dunn spread his hands at him.</p>
<p>“Anything the matter with you, Tony?” Kerslake patted Twain hard on the back which snapped him out of it.</p>
<p>“Ah… It’s David, good morning!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. I just suddenly feel that there are so many wonderful things in the world that I don’t even exist…”</p>
<p>Kerslake was even more certain that something was wrong with Twain. He said, “If you know all of them, then you’re not Tony Twain. You would be God.” Then he knew it was futile to ask Twain, so he turned to ask Dunn, who had been with Him. “What’s wrong with him, Dunn?”</p>
<p>“A boulder was suddenly thrown into an otherwise normally calm lake. That’s what happened, David.” Dunn answered with a smile.</p>
<p>Kerslake was even more confused by the remark. He glanced at Dunn and muttered, “Is this East Asian people’s mysticism?” You’re both crazy…” Kerslake decided not to care about what happened to them. It was all good as long as Twain still remembered how to train and lead the team. He turned and walked away from the inexplicable duo.</p>
<p>Dunn took a look at Twain and followed Kerslake to walk away.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you playing a guessing game with Tony?” Kerslake asked.</p>
<p>“My lake has always been very calm.” Dunn replied with a smile.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The abandoned Twain stood alone outside his office when his cell phone rang.</p>
<p>He was not so distracted that he did not answer his phone, not to mention that it was Shania who called.</p>
<p>Shania did not exchange pleasantries with him. She kept the call short and when the phone was connected:</p>
<p>“Are you free at noon, Uncle Tony? Let’s have a meal together.” After she gave the name and address of the restaurant, he only heard the “beep, beep, beep” sound.</p>
<p>Twain wanted to say something, but the call was already disconnected.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 682 - Goodbye Kiss</p>
<p>As the time in university approached its end after four years, the class monitor and the secretary of the Communist Youth League Branch Committee [1] would begin organizing a ‘farewell meal’ that all students – even students who were not usually close to one another, had to attend. Needless to say, students in tight-knit cliques would not only attend this farewell meal, but they would already have had countless of such meals days before that as well.</p>
<p>Twain did not have a lot of friends during his time in school. In spite of that, there were quite a few students who went up to him for a toast during the farewell meal, saying a bunch of inappropriate things before lifting their necks and swigging down their glasses.</p>
<p>There was even a classmate who brought along a camcorder and recorded a video of the farewell meal. The footage was subsequently burned into a CD and distributed to every student as a memento.</p>
<p>Twain did not dispose of the CD that he was given, though he does not remember where he placed it or if he brought it along with him when he moved to Nottingham.</p>
<p>However, that meal left a lasting impression on him, so much so that he does not need to watch the video in the CD again to know what happened. That night, the students all gathered in twos and threes and began talking about things that they did not have the courage to previously under the influence of alcohol. Some were amusing and some were melancholic. There were students who zealously talked about how they will write a brand new chapter of their lives in the society, students who were busy confessing to their crushes, students who pretended to be tipsy and went around asking for hugs from girls, and students who would grab onto their best buds in university and drink gulp after gulp and glass after glass…</p>
<p>In a nutshell, there was only one recurring theme associated with the farewell meal: break up, goodbye or disband.</p>
<p>Even though Twain was aware that Shania was neither a transmigrator nor a university student in China before, he could not stop his restless mind from thinking about the possibility of a ‘farewell meal’.</p>
<p>“Uncle Tony. Thank you for all the care that you have given me for these past few years, but I think it is better for me to leave so that I won’t interfere with your life. Goodbye!”</p>
<p>If such words were to come out of Shania’s mouth, Twain really had no idea what he would feel.</p>
<p>It turned out that he has already grown used to life with Shania around.</p>
<p>He had never felt that the girl was truly away from him and his life, even though she worked in the United States, and they were separated by half a globe.</p>
<p>It is just that we can’t meet that often…</p>
<p>Lisa Aria’s words from this morning sent shockwaves through Twain.</p>
<p>The word ‘jealous’ had never surfaced in his mind before, but now he was forced to confront this issue at hand. Even though he has never had a girlfriend before in his life, does not have any plans to start a family, and did not have any successful experiences with love relationships in his past life, he still understood what ‘jealous’ means, and was also aware of the kind of people who will get jealous.</p>
<p>The issue… Appears to have gotten complicated.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain’s head was in the clouds for the entire morning. He was never able to focus his attention on the reserve team’s training. Trainings of such a level had nothing to do with him either way, so he simply put on a pair of sunglasses and mulled over the issue by the side of the field.</p>
<p>There was no training session in the afternoon, so everyone decided to head back home when the morning training session finished around noon. Dunn had intended to go home with Twain, but was rejected.</p>
<p>“I have something on…” Twain noticed that Dunn was looking at him without a hint of surprise, and immediately went on to explain, “I’m definitely not headed to some bar looking for a one night stand this time.”</p>
<p>“I know. It’s Shania, right?”</p>
<p>Twain nodded his head. “She called earlier and wants me to have lunch with her. Oh yes, Dunn, what do you think she will say to me?”</p>
<p>“Happy birthday.”</p>
<p>“She has already said that to me at my house late last night.”</p>
<p>“That was from me to you. It’s your birthday today. As for what she wants to say to you, how would I know?”</p>
<p>Twain thought about it and realized what he said made sense. Dunn was no love expert and was certainly not Shania. How would he know about such things? He was becoming a little too muddled this morning.</p>
<p>“Should I head back home and change into a new set of clothes?” Twain stretches out his hands and does a spin for Dunn.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for that. What I mean is, it’s the same no matter what you change into. Just head on over.” Dunn said with a smile.</p>
<p>With that, Twain headed straight off without changing. Of course, he did not forget to buy a bouquet of flowers along the way, intending to use that to apologize to Shania.</p>
<p>What does he have to apologize about?</p>
<p>Uncle Tony should not bring prostitutes back home…</p>
<p>Ah, Miss Lisa Aria, please sacrifice yourself one more time!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain got into Landy’s car and travelled to Beeston, which is located south-west of Nottingham. This was the first time Twain has ever visited this place, as Beeston is situated very far away from the city area of Nottingham. A river separates this small town from Clifton, which is where construction works are underway for Nottingham Forest’s new stadium.</p>
<p>Twain surveyed the sceneries of the streets beyond the window curiously and noticed that the cab came to a stop before a narrow alleyway.</p>
<p>“Tony, the Chinese restaurant that you told me about should be here… But I don’t see any shops around…”</p>
<p>Landy, the cab driver, turned his head around as he sat on his driver’s seat and pointed outside the window. There was a light box at the alleyway with the words ‘NOSH Sichuan Restaurant’ written on it in a combination of English and Chinese characters.</p>
<p>“There’s a sign but no shop. Chinese restaurants sure are mysterious.”</p>
<p>Twain smiled as he patted Landy on the shoulder. “In China, there’s a saying that has been circulating around that the tastiest, most authentic restaurants will always be opened in obscure places. The most run down shops have the most delicious cuisines. Thank you, Landy.”</p>
<p>Twain pushed the door open and got off. He followed the arrow as displayed on the light box and walked straight into the alleyway. As he came out of the alleyway, he saw that pitifully small NOSH Sichuan Restaurant.</p>
<p>A foreigner approached him. The staff from the restaurant came up to him enthusiastically, adopting a Chinese style of greeting for their customers. It was completely different from the ‘gentlemanly’ etiquette that was adopted in other foreign restaurants, which made people feel as though they were separated by a piece of glass. The staff’s greeting made Twain feel at home, which was something he has not felt in a while. This was likely a feeling that only the Chinese are able to understand…</p>
<p>“Sir, table for…?”</p>
<p>“Uh…” Twain was stumped by the question. He peered into the restaurant. It was lunch time and the small shop was full of customers, most of whom were Chinese students who were studying abroad. They had yellow skin, black hair and black eyes, and were speaking in either Chinese or its dialects, which made finding the person he was after much easier.</p>
<p>“I’m with her.” Twain told the staff as he pointed to Shania, who was reading newspapers in the shop.</p>
<p>He was brought before Shania. The beautiful girl glanced up at Tony, then lowered the newspapers and pointed at the seat across of her.</p>
<p>“Have a seat, Uncle Tony.” Her voice was a little cold.</p>
<p>Twain sat down and inhaled deeply, trying hard to start a conversation. “Smells of chili.”</p>
<p>“This must mean that this place is as authentic as it gets?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I asked around and they said that this is the most authentic Chinese restaurant in Nottingham. They also told me to order this if I ever visited…” Shania pointed at the plate of food that was already on the table.</p>
<p>Twain took a look at it and exclaimed, “Pork Lungs in Chili Sauce?”</p>
<p>“Try it. I don’t know how authentic it is, but perhaps you will know once you try.”</p>
<p>Twain did not move his chopsticks. He stared at the table full of familiar or unfamiliar Chinese cuisines. It was quite the feast, but he could not grasp Shania’s intention behind ordering a table full of food.</p>
<p>“Do you not have an appetite? Not hungry?”</p>
<p>“Uh… No.” Twain still did not dare to move his chopsticks. He was afraid that it will really turn out to be a ‘farewell meal’ once he ate.</p>
<p>Shania clearly interpreted his actions differently. She held up the glass of beer beside her and said, “That’s right, I forgot to say this. Happy birthday, Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>It was surely rude to let a girl hold up a glass and wait. Twain did not figure out her intentions, but still raised the glass nonetheless. Before their glasses clinked with each other, he cautiously asked, “Your next sentence isn’t going to be ‘goodbye’, right?”</p>
<p>Shania, who had pulled a long face up till then, burst out into a short laugh, but quickly regained a straight face once more.</p>
<p>“Uh, I think I should apologize to you, Shania. About yesterday night…” He handed her the bouquet of flowers.</p>
<p>Shania put down her glass and received the bouquet with both hands. She brought it before her nostrils and sniffed. It was fragrant.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Uncle Tony… But I wasn’t mad. I think you are thinking too much. I have no right to be telling you how to live your life.”</p>
<p>“You are lying,” Twain uncourteously called her out on her lie, “The way you have been speaking up till now sounds very unnatural.”</p>
<p>Twain felt a little relieved after seeing Shania accept his flowers. He wanted to explain the previous night’s events to Shania, but he did not know where to start, or how to say it.</p>
<p>Shania rolled her eyes. “What do I need to do to sound natural? Actually, I did not treat you to this meal just so I can listen to you apologize or anything. This was a meal that I had arranged for a while back.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Her words made Twain feel as though he had just plunged into a sea of cloud and mist.</p>
<p>“This was a meal that I ordered three days ago to celebrate your birthday. It’d be a waste if we don’t eat it. Also, your birthday present is in the parking lot. It’s the jeep that I drove away in yesterday.”</p>
<p>Twain had been completely turned to stone. He understood the gravity of Shania’s words even though she had only mentioned them casually.</p>
<p>He was no fool. He was well aware of what was going on. She gave him a car as his birthday present just like that!</p>
<p>Still, it was just a car, and it was something that was easy to put a price on, but, in contrast, the meal… Was something that one could not determine the value of.</p>
<p>Even he has not visited this tiny restaurant that was located in a remote area and was supposedly the most authentic restaurant in Nottingham before. He had no idea who Shania had to ask to get information about such a restaurant.</p>
<p>“I know you like Chinese cuisines… To be honest, British food is horrible.” Shania shrugged. “Going to Burns’ bar to eat all the time is just going to take a toll on your body one day.”</p>
<p>Twain picked up a piece of meat off the ‘Pork Lungs in Chili Sauce’ dish and stuffed it into his mouth wordlessly. He chewed slowly.</p>
<p>Hmm… It tastes a little more sour and sweet than the authentic ones in China. It’s also not spicy enough. But…</p>
<p>He raised his head and smiled at Shania. “This is really authentic.”</p>
<p>A small smile emerges on Shania’s face.</p>
<p>“Can you stop pulling such a long face, Shania?” begged Twain, who could not get used to the Shania who wore a cold expression on her face, just like the one she would wear as a model strutting down a runway during a fashion show.</p>
<p>“But I don’t feel like smiling now.”</p>
<p>“So you are angry with me… Honestly, that was all just a misunderstanding. That… That woman was just a… Uh… Prostitute that I met while I was out drowning my sorrows. You know how I need them sometimes…”</p>
<p>“Is that so?” Shania asked. She picked up the newspapers that she had set aside earlier and raised it before Twain’s eyes for him to see the headline that was printed on it.</p>
<p>“Shocking! Famous Premier League Coach Tony Twain’s Secret Girlfriend!!”</p>
<p>“Was it a prostitute masquerading as a beautiful journalist, or a journalist masquerading as a seductive prostitute?”</p>
<p>Seeing that article made Twain want to bury his head in the plate of ‘Pork Lungs in Chili Sauce’ before him.</p>
<p>“That journalist was crazy for a shot to fame. It’s a load of crap!” Twain quickly explained.</p>
<p>“Load of crap?” Shania shifted her gaze from Twain’s face and towards the narrow sky that could be seen outside of the shop.</p>
<p>Twain suddenly recalled Lisa Aria’s remark about being ‘jealous’ as he saw Shania in that state.</p>
<p>“Does Uncle Tony wish for that article to be a load of crap?” Shania reverted her gaze back on him.</p>
<p>Twain did not know how he should answer that question. He felt that the Shania today was odd. She kept on saying baffling things, and kept on displaying enigmatic and inscrutable expressions on her face.</p>
<p>“Do you wish for that?” Shania asked again after seeing that Twain was not responding to her.</p>
<p>Twain had no choice but to confront the issue. He carefully recalled every single moment that he spent with Shania and went silent for quite a while. This time, Shania did not urge him for a response.</p>
<p>After a long time, Twain finally raised his head. He looked at Shania and said, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Shania smiled and did not probe further. To her, the fact that Uncle Tony did not nod and say, ‘yes’ at once made her very happy.</p>
<p>The two of them were caught up in their own thoughts and they finished the meal in silence. The atmosphere was strange throughout the meal. Thereafter, Shania led Twain to the parking lot to take a look at his birthday gift.</p>
<p>“A Mercedes-Benz jeep. Hope you like it, Uncle Tony,” said Shania, who pointed towards the white jeep as they were in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Twain caresses the cool exterior of the car, unsure of what to say. At last, all he could do was laugh and say, “Shania, this gift of yours is too expensive. All I ever gave you for your birthday were cheap Totoro soft toys…”</p>
<p>“If you liked Totoro soft toys, I would have bought them for you too. If it’s a gift for someone you are keen to give to, nothing is too expensive or too cheap.” Shania did not want to hear those words from Twain. She shook her head and continued on, without waiting for Twain’s response, “Send me over to Heathrow Airport!”</p>
<p>“Airport?” Twain was taken aback.</p>
<p>“I had secretly snuck away to come here. I don’t have time to be playing around here. I have to rush back at once.”</p>
<p>“You flew back from America just to celebrate my birthday?” Twain looked at her incredulously.</p>
<p>“Yes, what of it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think… Don’t you think… It is too far and too troublesome?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” Shania shook her head, “This is the first time I’m celebrating your birthday for you. I don’t want to just say a superficial ‘Happy Birthday’ to you over the phone.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’d have been happy if you just called to tell me that, Shania.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be happy! Like I’ve said, no matter how far it is, I won’t think it is far, and no matter how troublesome it is, I won’t think that it is troublesome if it is for someone I am keen to give to! Send me to the airport now!”</p>
<p>Without waiting for Twain’s response, Shania had pulled open the door to the front passenger seat and got into the car.</p>
<p>Twain could only shake his head as he pulled open the car door. He realized that the day had been strange. Ever since the moment he confronted Shania, he has never once gained the upper hand in their interactions. That was not how it had been in the past…</p>
<p>“All right, I’m saying this first. My driving skills… are terrible.”</p>
<p>“My life is already in your hands. Do what you can, Uncle Tony.” Shania began to fasten her seatbelt as she settled into the front passenger seat.</p>
<p>Twain admitted defeat.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Do you have a lot on your mind recently, Uncle Tony?” Shania asked Twain, who was completely focused on driving, as they were travelling on the M1 highway en route to London.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing worth mentioning.” Twain wanted to make himself sound more authoritative, but it came out sounding weak instead.</p>
<p>“I’ve asked Dunn before, and he said that you’ve been smoking and drinking much more than you did in the past. Is it due to the transfers?”</p>
<p>“It’s normal for the manager to dwell over things like that.”</p>
<p>“How can that be counted as normal? You don’t need to rely on alcohol and cigarettes to relief your stress. Frankly speaking, Uncle Tony, I’m very worried about your health condition. Have you gone for a health check-up before?</p>
<p>“What good can come from doing that?”</p>
<p>“It’s better for you to go for it.” Shania began to count Twain’s ‘misdeeds’ on her fingers. “Irregular daily routine. Poor sleeping habits. A lot of stress from work. Alcoholic. Smokes a lot. Lacks exercise… Do you perhaps think that your life is too long for you, Uncle Tony?”</p>
<p>If not for the fact that he was currently driving, Twain would have held up both hands and surrendered. Today, he was truly scared of this girl.</p>
<p>“All right, all right. I will listen to you. I will go and do a check-up tomorrow, and quit drinking and smoking after that. I will make sure my life follows a set routine… But I don’t quite care about stress from work. There’s no such thing as a manager without stress in this world.”</p>
<p>“It’d be great if you really can do all that.” Shania clearly knows all about Twain’s trustworthiness. She sighed in exasperation.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The two had to bid farewell once Twain sent Shania to the check-in counter at the airport.</p>
<p>“Next time, don’t secretly sneak out anymore. You are just making things difficult for Mr. Fasal.” Twain handed a bag that he had been carrying to Shania, who had now donned a pair of wide frame sunglasses and a sun hat.</p>
<p>“If I don’t sneak out, it’s going to be very difficult to see you, Uncle Tony.” There was finally a hint of reluctance in Shania as she turned around to look at the counter.</p>
<p>“Are you that busy?” Twain asked.</p>
<p>“Very busy.”</p>
<p>“Uh… Once this season is over, I’d definitely go over to America and play with you for a while.” Twain did not know how else to console Shania and that was all he could say.</p>
<p>“I have to wait 10 months for that.” Shania pouted.</p>
<p>“To be exact, it’s 9 months. The league ends in May.” Twain corrected her.</p>
<p>“That is way too long…”</p>
<p>The two of them sank into a period of awkward silence.</p>
<p>Twain looked at the human traffic around them and reminded Shania, “It should be time to check-in, right?”</p>
<p>Shania nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Then… Goodbye, Shania.” Twain waved his hand to bid farewell.</p>
<p>However, Shania did not respond in the same way and say, “Goodbye, Uncle Tony.”</p>
<p>She stood very close to Twain. Shania had kept her head down and displayed reluctance initially, but she suddenly raised her head to look at Twain. Her fiery gaze enchanted Twain and sent him into a trance. He did not know what Shania wanted to do.</p>
<p>An announcement urging passengers flying to Los Angeles to finish their check-in processes began to play in the airport, yet Shania did not turn around to leave. She took a small step forward, almost nestling herself into Twain’s arms, then lifted her head and planted her tender red lips onto Twain’s.</p>
<p>The soft and moist sensation of her lips was like a knife that had stabbed and embedded itself in Twain’s mind. Shania’s every breath was fragrant. Twain felt intoxicated just from the scent alone, almost like there was a glass of fine wine that had just been placed right by his lips. Both his brain and body failed to respond, as if he had just consumed a lot of wine. His whole body was stiff and did not know how to react.</p>
<p>In between consciousness, he heard Shania murmur by his ear, “Maybe you’d think this is all too sudden, Uncle Tony. But I can’t wait any longer… I love you, Uncle Tony. I… Love… You.”</p>
<p>It was all too much to process for Twain’s brain. Too many outrageous things had happened in the span of one day and he could barely keep track of them all.</p>
<p>Shania’s brazen kiss from before had lessened the impact brought about by her confession.</p>
<p>As he continued to stand there in a daze, Shania had already leapt away from his arms, giggling.</p>
<p>“This is a goodbye kiss. Goodbye, Uncle Tony!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 683 - I Love You, Do You Love Me?</p>
<p>A scene that he had never dared to think about and had never thought about before had just happened on this very day, and it impacted Twain deeply.</p>
<p>His heart that had been beating furiously came to a stop when Shania whispered the words ‘I love you’ by his ear.</p>
<p>He stood rooted at the spot like a statue, and did not even react when Shania waved him goodbye.</p>
<p>He was not a moron. He understood what ‘love’ is, and what ‘I love you’ meant. He could not lie to himself and say that those were just words of admiration that Shania had said to someone older than her. She might be able to say the words ‘I love you’ to her parents, but to say ‘I love you’ to a man without any blood relations with her could only mean one thing.</p>
<p>She had truly fallen for him.</p>
<p>Twain felt as though his head was about to explode.</p>
<p>Something like this… Something like this… How could it happen to him?</p>
<p>It felt like a story without build up or sex without foreplay. Everything happened too quickly and Twain’s heart really could not handle it all.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>As he sat in the car that was given to him by Shania, Twain was still reminiscing about everything that had happened these two days. He wanted to connect the dots and find the clues hidden within. He then realized that what the journalist, Lisa Aria, said had been completely right. Shania was not angry as he had assumed she was. She was just being jealous.</p>
<p>A girl who was in love with him wanted to give him a surprise, only to find that he had brought a seductive woman home. What was she feeling when she saw that?</p>
<p>Twain had never been in love before, but he had watched soap operas so he knew.</p>
<p>The problem is, why would Shania harbor such feelings for him? He had deliberately avoided using the word ‘love’, because he felt that the word ‘love’ was heavy and embodied a sense of responsibility. It was a word that he was not fully prepared to accept just yet.</p>
<p>Is it because they are always together?</p>
<p>There is a Chinese saying that states that ‘familiarity breeds fondness’.</p>
<p>However, Twain did not think that there was anything about him that would make a girl fall in love with him after a long period of interaction. He liked to drink, smoke, was temperamental, never cared about trifles or hygiene, not good at sweet-talking, would never give expensive gifts, was a male chauvinist, was full of himself, selfish, possessive, rude, unreasonable, was someone who would rather betray the whole world than to let the whole world betray him… And, at times, he was also a little superficial.</p>
<p>Frankly, what the media had been reporting about me so far was not wrong. There is nothing positive that can be found on me. Twain mocked himself in his thoughts.</p>
<p>Twain fished out his hand phone and dialled for his cab driver Landy. “Is this Landy? Are you free right now? Yes? That’s good. Can you come over to Heathrow Airport to pick me up and send me home? No… No, you don’t need to drive your cab over. You just need to bring yourself over here and help me drive my car back. Yes. Thank you!”</p>
<p>After finishing the call, Twain continued to sit in his car’s interior to rack his brains over the problem that had already given him a terrible headache.</p>
<p>Could it be possible that the little girl simply mistook ‘like’ and ‘admiration’ for ‘love’ because she had been spending a lot of time with me?</p>
<p>Twain immediately shook his head and threw that thought out of the window. Shania was not a 13 year-old. Moreover, she was a Brazilian girl. Not knowing what ‘love’ was when she was already 18 was impossible.</p>
<p>Twain decided to stop thinking about things that he could not make sense of for now. He raised his head and looked at the blue sky beyond the car’s window, and watched as plane after plane took off and landed. This was a busy airport.</p>
<p>What was Shania feeling after saying those words?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Shania made use of the few minutes before take-off to call and notify her manager that she was on her way back.</p>
<p>“Has everything been sorted out, Shania?” Fasal asked over the phone with a laugh.</p>
<p>“Yes, all done.”</p>
<p>“What was his reply?”</p>
<p>“I left before hearing it. I think he might still be standing like a log there. Uncle Tony is not mentally tough…” said Shania as she pursed her lips.</p>
<p>“You are one to talk. You are just like him. What do you plan to do from here on out if you don’t even know his answer?”</p>
<p>“What else can I do? I can only wait. Maybe he’d call me, maybe he won’t… Mr. Fasal, am I being a little too stubborn?”</p>
<p>“A little stubborn, yes, but you can’t deal with people like Tony without being stubborn. I can only wish you good luck, Shania. It beats me what Tony will think about it all.”</p>
<p>Shania ended the phone call and followed the stewardess’s instructions to fasten her seatbelt as she sat on her seat. She began to recall the conversation that she had with Mr. Fasal when she decided to take time off to fly to Nottingham.</p>
<p>She came to the decision to tell everything that was on her mind to her manager. She told Fasal about how she has always liked Uncle Tony, and how those feelings slowly developed into love. She did not know how to explain what brought about the change in feelings, and how those feelings came about. All she could say was that she was truly in love with Uncle Tony.</p>
<p>She was already 18, and Uncle Tony was about to turn 40. She did not want to wait any longer and so she definitely had to fly back to Nottingham and make use of the birthday celebration to confess her feelings to him.</p>
<p>Fasal was not surprised in the slightest at everything Shania had said to him. He only asked Shania if she was confident in getting Twain to accept her feelings.</p>
<p>Shania’s response was that she was very confident that she would be able to do it. After years of spending time with Uncle Tony, she felt that he was someone who truly treated her well, and his kindness was not something that a stranger would be able to give. After all, Twain was not her father, and not a relative of hers. She believed in that kindness that she was shown.</p>
<p>However, her confidence wavered once she arrived in Nottingham and witnessed Twain bringing an unknown woman back home. It was only until the end of the trip that she was able to muster all her courage and tell him everything that she had kept within her heart. She did not dare to hear his reply, so she made use of her boarding the airplane as an excuse and fled from the scene.</p>
<p>Right now, she has no idea what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>However, she had thought it through. The words have already been said, and whatever was going to happen from now on was out of her control. There was no use thinking about it. All she could do was wait.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>As Shania’s plane was flying through the skies above the Atlantic Ocean, Landy, who was here to drive Twain home, saw him standing in front of a jeep, with his brows furrowed and lost in thoughts.</p>
<p>“What a great car.” Landy patted the bonnet of the car gently and whistled. “How much did it cost?”</p>
<p>It was only then that Twain realized that he did not ask Shania about how much the car had cost. He shook his head in exasperation and said, “I don’t know. It was a birthday gift.”</p>
<p>Landy looked at Twain and asked, “Shania?”</p>
<p>Twain nodded.</p>
<p>“She’s so good to you, Tony.” As he made sense of everything, Landy went on to say with a smile, “Good for you, too.”</p>
<p>How could Twain possibly not understand what he was getting at?</p>
<p>He forced a smile as he pulled the car door open. “Get in the car. I need to trouble you to be my chauffeur, Landy.”</p>
<p>“But, I do recall that you can drive?”</p>
<p>“Not now, I’m afraid I’d get into an accident and die on the way home.”</p>
<p>“You look like you have a lot on your mind. Did something happen between the two of you?”</p>
<p>They may have met by chance, but Landy has always treated Twain as a very good friend. Hence, Shania, who would always sit in his car when the two of them went out together, was also naturally his friend. He was familiar with both of them and so he asked Twain out of concern.</p>
<p>“Did the two of you fight?”</p>
<p>“It’s more complicated than that… Forget it. It’s nothing. Just drive.”</p>
<p>Instead of driving, Landy pulled the keys out of the ignition. “Am I someone you can’t trust, Tony? I won’t go around telling tales. I’m just concerned about you.” Landy looked at Twain and said in a serious tone.</p>
<p>“All right, I’d talk. Just drive.” Twain shrugged and said, “Shania just told me she loves me.”</p>
<p>Landy missed as he tried to insert the keys into the ignition.</p>
<p>Twain watched him and Landy immediately explained himself, “I’m not surprised! I’m not surprised at all! I had already guessed that this was the case long ago. I just never thought she’d tell you today. Happy birthday, Tony! You just received the best birthday gift.”</p>
<p>Twain looked at Landy, who was starting to gesture around excitedly. “Why do you look so excited about this?”</p>
<p>“How did you think I’d act, Tony? Did you think I will cry and pull a long face? This is clearly great news!”</p>
<p>“Why?” Twain threw out his hands before him. “There is a huge age gap between us. I’m older than her by 22 years! People won’t find it odd if I was her dad, right?”</p>
<p>“Then how did you perceive her all these years? Did you see her as your daughter?”</p>
<p>Twain went quiet for moment before replying, “Sometimes… I do feel that way. She’s just like my own daughter. I want her to be happy, to have things go her way in life and be safe. I want to take of care of her, just like how I would take care of my own daughter. Did you know, her parents hardly care about what goes on with her. I am in charge of everything that has to do with her. I had to call and ask a friend to take care of her now that she’s in Hollywood. I don’t think of this as love at all… How can I possibly not feel like a dad taking care of a daughter?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s hard for people to see things clearly when they stand too close.” Landy revved up the engine, and slowly drove out of the parking lot.</p>
<p>“You didn’t sleep yesterday right, Tony?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>Landy pointed at Landy’s eyes. “I noticed it earlier in the afternoon. They are terribly red. Go ahead and rest, I will wake you up when we reach your house.”</p>
<p>Twain felt a wave of exhaustion assault him right as Landy said that. It was true that he did not sleep. The events that had happened were so horrifying that he became overstimulated. Now that it has all come to an end, it was time to take a rest.</p>
<p>“All right, I’m tired… Wake me up when we reach my house, Landy.” His body slid down as he reclined against the front passenger seat. He cocked his head to a side and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“I love you, Uncle Tony…”</p>
<p>Shania snuggled into Twain’s arms. They had just been engaged in a wet kiss. She looked up at Twain with eyes full of passion, her cheeks flushed and her lips looking breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>“I object!” A man appeared before the two of them.</p>
<p>Color drained from Shania’s face as she pressed herself against Twain’s chest. “Dad!”</p>
<p>“Jordie, you have utterly broken my heart…” A grief-stricken woman appeared beside the man and gazed at Shania.</p>
<p>“Mum…”</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain! I may have left my daughter in your care, but it was not to make it easier for you to trick her into bed!” Shania’s father was extremely agitated. “Is this how you repay my trust?”</p>
<p>Shania’s mother reached out a hand and looked as though she wanted to pull Shania. Her face was streaked with tears that glistened under the light.</p>
<p>“Jordie. I don’t understand. Why would you fall in love with a man old enough to be your father… I’m so disappointed with you… So disappointed with you…”</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, you are worse than an animal!”</p>
<p>“Jordie, come with me. Come with your mother…”</p>
<p>“Don’t say anything more!” Shania shrieked, and hugged Twain even more tightly. Her hug was so tight that Twain felt as though he could barely gasp for air. “I won’t accept anyone else other than Uncle Tony! I want to be with him. I want to be with him for the rest of my life!”</p>
<p>“Mr. Twain, what have you done to my daughter?”</p>
<p>“Jordie, please stop throwing a tantrum…”</p>
<p>“I’m not throwing a tantrum, Dad, Mum.” Shania glanced at Twain shyly and lowered her head a little. “Actually, I’m pregnant with…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain was scared awake. However, that uncomfortable feeling that made him feel as though he could not breathe was still there, and it misled him into thinking that whatever just happened was not a dream in his daze.</p>
<p>“You are already awake?” Landy’s voice called out from the side. In this moment, Twain found his voice to be the most melodious voice in the whole world. He wanted to hug Landy and kiss his wrinkled face.</p>
<p>He realized that he was immobilized. He looked down and found that the seatbelt was still fastened. This was what made it difficult for him to breathe.</p>
<p>“We have yet to reach. You can sleep for a while longer.”</p>
<p>“No thanks, I can’t sleep…” Twain wiped beads of perspiration off his forehead.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Had a dream about a boring, cheesy and obscene soap opera.”</p>
<p>“Look at how scared you are… What kind of soap opera can make you this scared?”</p>
<p>“A very horrifying soap opera. The kind that airs at 3am in the morning…” Twain rolled down the window, intending to let some fresh air in, only to find himself gasping for air as a gale of wind blew against him. He clumsily rolled the windows back up. It was then that he remembered that they were travelling at a speed of over 120km/h on the highway.</p>
<p>“This car is really great!” Landy patted the steering wheel and praised the car once again.</p>
<p>“If you like it I can…” Twain noticed that Landy was staring at him, and raised both hands. “… Not give it to you.”</p>
<p>Landy laughed.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Dunn did not probe about what happened between Twain and Shania during lunch when Twain returned home. Twain said nothing to him as well. His head was in a complete mess and he really was not in the mood to be sharing about his own personal life with others.</p>
<p>There was only one thing that would help him forget about his troubles momentarily.</p>
<p>Work.</p>
<p>The international games were about to end, and the players who had been scattered all over the globe will begin returning to their teams one after another. The Premier League that had been suspended for two weeks will begin once again. The UEFA Champions League would kick off soon as well. Things were going to get very busy.</p>
<p>Before things got busy, he typed an e-mail to Shania, who was far away in America.</p>
<p>“… Thank you for your birthday gift, Shania. Thank you for your goodbye kiss… I really like Shania as well, but I don’t know whether my feelings are ‘love’ or not. It’s very difficult for me to explain to you the kind of feelings that I have.</p>
<p>… As you know, I’m actually someone who’s really dumb. This problem is too complicated and I can’t come up with an answer in a short period of time. So please allow me to owe you for now. Remember that I owe you an answer…”</p>
<p>“Is this an indirect rejection, Mr. Fasal?” Shania showed the e-mail to the person beside her whom she felt the closest to.</p>
<p>Fasal shook his head and smiled. “No, Tony is swayed. The good thing is, he’s not averse to the fact that you love him. Keep at it, Shania. Let him see your heart clearly.”</p>
<p>Shania pouted. “I love him. Does he love me?”</p>
<p>“Why? Did you just lose confidence in yourself?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I just… Think about it occasionally. Maybe it’s possible that he does.”</p>
<p>Fasal smiled. “The British are different from you Brazilians. Most of them are conservative, reserved, reticent and shy. They are not too willing to show what they feel directly, and they always make people feel like they are hard to approach. But the truth is, once you make your way into their hearts, you will receive the warmest reciprocation you can ever get. The warmth will be beyond your imagination and tolerance. Isn’t it ironic? The French say that the British are naked pirates once they shed off their outer layers. I think this saying makes a lot of sense. Tony is actually quite different from most of the traditional British. But this part of his here…” Fasal pointed at his heart, “Is still as sturdy as a castle. In Britain we have a proverbial saying which goes, ‘An Englishman’s home is his castle’. What it means is that the British care a lot about their privacy, and you can interpret it as saying that the British guard their most private things as though they were a sturdy castle, and they will not let anyone snoop around easily.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Fasal, you know a lot about the British…”</p>
<p>“That’s because I’m a British myself.” Fasal lifted the teacup and took a sip. It was time for afternoon tea.</p>
<p>“Uh… I’ve been with Uncle Tony for too long. I almost think that every British acts like him. I forgot that there’s people like you.” Shania scratched her head in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“What he represents is the British after they’ve shed their outer layers.”</p>
<p>“What about you?</p>
<p>“As for me,” Fasal lowered his teacup elegantly, “I’m a gentleman.”</p>
<p>Seeing that Shania was still a little down on spirits, Fasal continued his attempt at enlightening her, “Don’t worry. Even if his heart is a sturdy castle, you have already made your way into it. It’s just that pirates tend to be a little careless, so they don’t really pay attention to the people and things around them. But once they notice them…” Fasal smiled. “I need to start racking my brains over what is the best thing to get the two of you for your marriage.”</p>
<p>Shania blushed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 684 - Remnant</p>
<p>Up till the end, Twain did not find Lisa Aria to ask for them to withdraw that news article and to release a public apology. This was not because he had forgotten about it, but his current self did not know what to expect. No matter if he agreed or not, Shania had indeed became his rumoured girlfriend, solely based on the fact she confessed her feelings to him. Thus, this article would not count as one that is fabricated.</p>
<p>Besides, he did not want to find those publishers again for a chance for the media to use this opportunity to blow up the issue. He was not sure of his inner feelings and he did not want to find trouble — he was never afraid of the complications from soccer, but he hopes to have less, if not none of those troubles that includes feelings and other women.</p>
<p>The reality was not too far off from what Twain hoped, the news publishers Lisa Aria supported had limited reputation. Adding on the fact the amount of rumours related to Twain’s rumoured girlfriends were plenty, it was initially Clarice Gloria who attracted some attention, but after that came news of some turkish beauty which became dull and no one cared. The two “rumoured girlfriends” mentioned above even had photographs as proof. However, the publishers could not even produce pictures proving the rumours between Tony Twain and Shania, how can they claim this to be “shocking news”? Is it only because discovering that both of them are friends gave them the right to freely fabricate such ridiculous news? They “were even able to guarantee the truth on their honor”. At today’s age who would not know that these entertainment producers sell their honour for a living. Definitely not many would believe Shania was Twain’s rumored girlfriend.</p>
<p>At this moment, if Twain’s rumoured boyfriend was not a chinese Tang but was actually David Kerslake or David Beckham, this news might have been more sensational.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Since that incident, other than writing that email, Twain has never contacted Shania. His current self did not know how to face that little fairy, he would feel a little uncomfortable until being simply did not want to think about it.</p>
<p>Luckily, he still had work to distract himself.</p>
<p>The new league champion group match schedule had already been arranged. Nottingham Forest, who successfully won the league champions, has gotten unprecedented attention. The experts were also optimistic about the performance of the seeded team. There was even such a voice speaking. “No matter which group Nottingham Forest is allocated, or what the other three teams in the group were, Tony Twain’s team would always win the group, and eight, nine of tens times topping the group. The other teams’ only option was to get the second spot of the group.”</p>
<p>The final outcome was Nottingham Forest being allocated into the last group.</p>
<p>The H group, other than the seeded team Nottingham Forest, had the old-school team Juventus who only returned to Seria A last season to win the championship in this current season. The Ukrainian traditional team FC Kyiv Dynamo and Belarus’ team Borisov were in the group too.</p>
<p>Only Kyiv Dynamo could create some upsets, Borisov was already been determined to be the minnow for the other three teams to win matches from. If everything goes as expected, the two teams leaving the aforementioned group should be Nottingham Forest and Juventus.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The international team competition had reached a pause and players concurrently returned to their respective teams. George Wood had finished his happiest fortnight in the national team as their first team starter. In the two matches on the 6th and the 10th, he gave his best in his debut and used actual results to repay Capello’s trust in him. In the matches where away team England won Andorra with two goals, 4 : 1 to defeat Croatia on away to take revenge for their elimination during the UEFA European Championship finals, George Wood’s midfield defense had a decisive impact.</p>
<p>Capello, who rarely personally praises a single player, told the media after their match with Croatia, “with George Wood, our offensive efficiency is a lot higher.”</p>
<p>Why was it higher? It was because they did not worry about frantically returning to defense after losing the possession.</p>
<p>George Wood used his unwavering sprinting and fierce defending to stop Croatia on their every attack. Croatia could not penetratrate the center path in midfield at all, their only plan was to take the side flanks. Croatia’s new star in the midfield, Tottenham Hotspurs’ Modrić was successfully subdued by George Wood where he only played for 65 minutes.</p>
<p>Twain was proud of Wood’s performance, he heavily complimented Capello on his own column. He said Capello was genuine talent in being a gold medallist coach, and under his guidance, England would definitely go far.</p>
<p>Of course, he did not forget to praise Wood’s performance. After all, his own proud discipline did not made him lose face. “… I said this earlier, George is England’s most outstanding defensive midfielder. It is a pity in the past where there were various reasons he could not be placed in an important position. But now I am glad he met a head coach who could truly appreciate his talents. I can even say, England would welcome the new “George Wood’s era” in the near future.</p>
<p>Twain was not even slightly afraid that exaggerating about George Wood will “kill” him. Because he was well clear that George Wood was not one who would be complacent because of his own pride, his past life experiences enabled him to be more calm than most people, and to be able to experience high honour and disgrace.</p>
<p>George Wood’s outstanding performance display was one of Twain’s few positive results from the international matches. The rest were injury reports.</p>
<p>Ribery, in France’s 2 : 1 victory over Serbia, left the match due to injury at the 77th minute, needing therapy for a week.</p>
<p>Martin Petrov in Bulgaria’s away draw 2:2 with Montenegro, was injured, and needed rest for 15 days.</p>
<p>Eastwood, after representing Wales’ match against Russia, was over exhausted and his fitness coach recommends him to miss the league game that was 3 days later.</p>
<p>Adding those who was still under the injury list, Van Nistelrooy with Van der Vaart who recently recovered and returned to the team whose condition was not guaranteed. Twain felt like it was a pitiful few number of players that he could use.</p>
<p>Although it was home field, and the opponent was Sunderland, Twain did not feel comfortable at all.</p>
<p>The negative scenes from the past summer were frequently reappearing, thus it would be weird if he could feel easy.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“As the following week we still have the champions league match, we need to use some rotations… Eastwood is recommended to not play for this match, Bale should be rotated out as well and Beckham should rest, Fleming suggests Van der Vaart should not play in the match against Sunderland because he was worried the rough Sunderland will cause him to be injured again…” says Kerslake, as he reads the report.</p>
<p>Twain waves his hand to interrupt him. “You should just say who is able to be allowed on field uh? Left flank totally has no people, center road only has two defensive midfielder, and there is not even a reserve for a striker.”</p>
<p>The group became silent, this situation was truly too tricky.</p>
<p>In the end, Twain arranged a roster where Akinfeev replaces van der Sar as the main goalkeeper, left defender being Leighton Baines, middle defender being Woodgate and Ayala, right defender being Rafinha.</p>
<p>Middle midfield being Tiago and George Wood — This time having clear role allocation, Tiago being in charge of defense and George Wood prioritizing attacking, which meant George Wood was pushed into an offensive position.</p>
<p>Left side midfielder being Kris Commons, right being Lennon.</p>
<p>There was no options for the strikers at all, Twain let Zigic partner up with Arshavin.</p>
<p>After this arrangement, Twain discovered the seven in the reserves did not need to decide on their positions, they just needed to be there.</p>
<p>Van der Sar, Chimbonda, Kompany, van der Vaart, Sun Jihai, Bale, Beckham.</p>
<p>The rest of the people were either injured or have no avouchment on their physical fitness, hence being unable to go on field.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Keane obviously knew about the plight of Nottingham Forest. Although his relationship with Twain was not bad, he could not vouch on that friendship. To defeat this half-beaten up Nottingham Forest, Sunderland picked up 120% of their efforts and bringing out their full main roster, striving to fight for an outcome which Keane desired.</p>
<p>Suffering from the drag from the international competitions, Nottingham Forest players were in their low states whilst having poor physical fitness. The whole of Sunderland team were actively fighting for the ball without holding back. Fleming’s worries were definitely with reason, Sunderland had exaggerated actions liken to a brute. As long as they could take back the possession, they did not care about the overwhelming booing from the audience stands. Luckily van de Vaart did not risk coming on field, or else who knows how long he had to rest after this match.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest started scoring at the start of the second half, but Sunderland, with their tenacious force snatching, gotten an opportunity in the opposing half and evened the score after five minutes. This goal impacted Nottingham Forest’s morale, facing the malicious Sunderland, the mentality of being afraid of being injured made the players over-cautious in their performance, causing them to not being able to display even half of their usual standards.</p>
<p>In the end, Nottingham Forest drew against Sunderland in their home field. Their rank in the league fell to the 5th place, placing them in the same position as Aston Villa and Hull City, whom they triumphed with a five goal lead.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Zigic’s debut was definitely not considered a success. Being the tallest player on the field, he was not able to adapt to the tactics played by Nottingham Forest. Plus, after losing van der Vaart and Ribéry, the support the midfield could give him was pitiful, he was not the type of striker who, after getting the possession by himself, could penetrate the defense, dribble past the guards, solo defeat the everyone on the defensive line and score. Even though his performance was average, Twain still left him on the field to play the full 90 minutes. On one hand it was simply because there was no one else to subsubtitute in, but on another he was hoping Zigic would adapt to the team’s playbook as fast as possible. After all, Twain did not buy him to sit on the stool to watch and learn the game but to push him to join the rotation immediately.</p>
<p>After the end of the match, everyone in the changing room was busy changing in order to quickly leave the stadium. Drawing to a team like Sunderland on home field did not make anyone happy, but there was no choice, this is soccer, no one could guarantee winning all their matches. Besides, everyone was clear that the team had more injuries than usual. So Twain also did not criticise the team’s performance, he only hoped that the team would perform with a different standard in the next week’s champions league match.</p>
<p>On the day after the game, Twain, with the help of translation, notified Zigic to talk to him personally.</p>
<p>The Serbian thought Twain was going to criticise his performance yesterday, but the first sentence that came out from Twain on their meeting was. “Have you experienced the difference between the Spanish League and English Football League?”</p>
<p>Zigic nodded. The match yesterday was totally different from the Spanish League match which he was used to.</p>
<p>“Could you tell me the difference?” Twain asked.</p>
<p>“Speed and tempo.” Zigic blurt out. Both teams, in yesterday’s match, had quick tempo changes between offense and defense, errors made this speed even faster. There were times Zigic was preparing to run back to defense, but Nottingham Forest had already intercepted the possession in their defensive half, preparing for yet another counter attack. In this endless running back and forth, Zigic expended tons of physical stamina, being another reason for him to be unable to display his best.</p>
<p>Twain nods with approval. “Absolutely, although there were also other differences, speed and tempo decides everything. English Football League, compared to other leagues, are a lot faster in terms of speed and tempo, so the demands to one’s physical form is higher, and you need to be smart enough. Yesterday, you expended a lot of physical strength… hasn’t Coach Tang told you before? What does our center forwards need to do? ”</p>
<p>“Make space, attract the opposing defense’s attention, make plays for teammates and shoot for the goal.”</p>
<p>“I feel like yesterday you… Ok, how do i say this, were a little too modest. You are a center forward, you should put “shooting for the goal” as your priority. If there is a scoring opportunity and you would give it up for others, in what situations will you choose to pass the ball? When you are pressurized by the defenders and are unable to turn the body, where your position is not optimal, when your teammates have a higher chance in scoring … then passing is your best choice. Yesterday you prioritized in passing the ball instead of scoring for yourself. Is this trying to win everyone’s hearts over?”</p>
<p>Zigic, after being told off by Twain, became embarrassed, he nodded to admit this original intention.</p>
<p>Twain smiled. “There is no use in this. I found you to become a center forward and not to play as a side midfielder. I indeed did value your abilities to make plays, but you are the center forward. If you want to let them accept you, like you, recognise you, it is actually very simple — score, repeatedly score. That way, everyone will like you.”</p>
<p>Twain had decided to focus on cultivating and supporting Zigic, if he was not adapted to the Premier League, then he would work hard to make Zigic to be comfortable, if he is unable to score, then he would work hard to create opportunities for him to score. He wanted to reestablish a tall center forward, he wanted to let those who are waiting to make fun of him to know, losing Bendtner did not cause huge losses to him, because he had Zigic!</p>
<p>Bendtner was able to pursue the type of soccer he truly wanted, he could enjoy the superiority of being the main core in Man City. But his team, Tony Twain’s team, would continue to win matches and championships.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 685 - Only a Matter of Time</p>
<p>The team suffered two losses in the Premier League following a series of injuries that prevented them from playing their best team. They also only managed to scrape a narrow 2-1 win over the Belarusian team FC BATE Borisov at home in the Champions League.</p>
<p>To Twain, the only good news was that the team’s injuries had mostly recovered after that match. There were no players suffering from major injuries, and the players who were suffering from minor injuries have all recovered as well and could be employed in their next match.</p>
<p>The Premier League had gone on for over a month by then, and Twain was finally able to play a match with a more complete team.</p>
<p>In the fifth match of the Premier League, Twain played his strongest team against Tottenham Hotspur in an away game.</p>
<p>Van der Sar, Pepe, Kompany, Gareth Bale, Rafinha, George Wood, Van der Vaart, Ribéry, David Beckham, Arshavin and Van Nisterooy.</p>
<p>Spurs came in second in the Premier League in terms of money spent during the summer to buy players, but they are currently last in the table after losing three of their past four matches and drawing one.</p>
<p>Juande Ramos was having a very hard time at Spurs. It was said that he would be sacked if he did not clinch a victory over Nottingham Forest at home.</p>
<p>Twain was certainly not in a position to feel sympathy for another person. If he were to sympathize with Ramos, then who would sympathize with him? Nottingham Forest’s team morale was low and he desperately needed a gratifying win to boost their morale. This made Tottenham, who looked to be down on their luck, the best team to help him achieve his cause.</p>
<p>Twain and his team of coaches were meticulous with their preparations for the match. He told his players that there was nothing that would make them and everyone else happier than being the undisputed winners of a match. They did not only need to win, they needed to win thoroughly!</p>
<p>The final score was 3-0. Nottingham Forest had a resounding victory over Spurs whose team morale and predicament were much worse than them.</p>
<p>Following the loss, Juande Ramos was sacked by Levy over the poor results, and he became the first manager in the new season of the Premier League to be shown the door.</p>
<p>The days of having to play two matches a week were yet to be over, however. Nottingham Forest had to keep their spirits up and face their next challenge.</p>
<p>On 25th September, Nottingham Forest had an away game against Ipswich in the EFL Cup. Twain employed a team that was mainly comprised of reserve players and they achieved a 4-1 win at the end of the match.</p>
<p>The two victories helped to reinvigorate the team and dispel the negativity that had imbued them following a rough start to the season.</p>
<p>Before the team travelled back home, Twain commended everyone in the dressing room for the performance.</p>
<p>“Oh.” On the bus back to Nottingham, Kerslake suddenly led out a low shout while examining the fixture list. He then passed the fixture list in his hand over to Twain who was seated behind him.</p>
<p>“Take a look at our next opponent.”</p>
<p>Twain brought the paper before his eyes and scanned for their sixth opponent.</p>
<p>Manchester City.</p>
<p>Dunn broke into a laugh beside him.</p>
<p>“The press must be ecstatic,” said Kerslake.</p>
<p>Twain shrugged and made no further comment.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Bendtner was already feeling the pressure from external parties. His time at Manchester City following his transfer was not that much better than his time at Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>During his time at Nottingham Forest, his pressure came from his authoritarian manager Tony Twain. At Manchester City, his pressure comes from the media and the fans’ scrutiny of him.</p>
<p>His debut appearance for Manchester City came during the very first match of the season at home to Chelsea. Bendtner was put on the bench and was only substituted onto the pitch when the game was all but lost. Robinho scored a free kick in that match, but Manchester City went on to lose 1-3 to Chelsea.</p>
<p>Bendtner only played for five minutes in that match, so naturally, he was not blamed for the loss, and no one pointed the finger at him for not scoring a goal either. However, things were different in the second match.</p>
<p>In the fifth match of the league, Manchester City faced Portsmouth at home. That match was akin to a festival to the Manchester City fans, because the team won by six goals over Pompey. Bendtner started in that match, but the six goals had nothing to do with him at all.</p>
<p>He had no assists and no goals. It was as though he was alienated from Manchester City’s tactics and set-up.</p>
<p>Robinho scored a hat-trick in that match. He had quickly become a fan favorite by finding the back of the net repeatedly since joining Manchester City.</p>
<p>After the match, a reporter cornered Bendtner in the mixed zone and asked him why he acted as though he was sleepwalking on the pitch. Bendtner pushed the blame onto the fact that he had only just joined the club and had yet to develop a chemistry with his new team mates.</p>
<p>The reporter then pressed him to explain why Robinho was able to perform so well despite also being a new addition to the team just like him.</p>
<p>Bendtner could only explain to the reporter that Robinho was a midfielder and so he was able to receive the ball a lot more than he did, which provided him with more opportunities at goal as a result. Since he was a center-forward, he needed support from the midfield.</p>
<p>What he meant with those words was that a difference in positions would lead to a difference in results. However, the words were twisted by the reporter, and they came out as ‘Danish forward complains about the lack of support from his team mates’ instead.</p>
<p>The fans who did not know the truth were enraged by the report. For the past two days at training, the fans would stay outside of the training grounds and boo Bendtner whenever he received the ball. He was met with antagonistic gazes within the dressing room as well.</p>
<p>This was a situation that he had never encountered in Nottingham Forest before. While he was still at Forest, he had Tony Twain, who would attract the attention of the reporters who enjoyed making things difficult for people. The atmosphere within the dressing room was also always amicable. He did not need to worry about how to deal with reporters either. With Tony Twain around, no one was interested to ask him any questions.</p>
<p>But now…</p>
<p>It has been half a month since he joined Manchester City, but he had not made a single true friend other than Ashley Young, who was also an ex-player of Forest just like him. He had no interactions with his new team mates beyond greeting each other when they met and when they parted ways.</p>
<p>Unlike the Brazilian Robinho who was lively and cheerful, Bendtner seemed a little reclusive.</p>
<p>Even though he has left Nottingham Forest, he still has the habit of finding news related to Nottingham Forest whenever he browses sports news. It is a habit which he feels conflicted and annoyed over. Habits are fearsome things…</p>
<p>As a result, he was generally kept abreast of the current situation that Forest is in. He might be carrying an immense pressure on him, but the pressure on Twain’s shoulders was not any lighter than his.</p>
<p>He sat alone in the dressing room of Manchester City’s Carrington training ground. All the other players had left, but he chose to stay and practise his shooting. He had only just gone back to the dressing room and was preparing to shower and change into a new set of clothes.</p>
<p>This was also a habit that he picked up during him time at Forest. Tony Twain was not personally involved in the team’s training, but he was very particular about players’ attitudes towards training. A player would receive a harsh dressing down from Twain if they were caught slacking during practice.</p>
<p>Additional practice also became a way for young players to catch the eye of the manager and fight for a chance to play in matches following the success of George Wood.</p>
<p>Mark Hughes never said that additional practice would lead to a guaranteed spot in the starting team now that he is a player for Manchester City, but Bendtner continued to do as he had always done in Forest nonetheless.</p>
<p>Bendtner walked out of the shower room naked and was about to put on his clothes when the door to the dressing room swung open.</p>
<p>“Ah…” The person who just came in was a little surprised. It was the manager Mark Hughes.</p>
<p>“Nicklas, you have not left? Did you just do extra practice for your shooting again?”</p>
<p>Nicklas nodded his head. “Yes, boss.”</p>
<p>“Good timing. There’s something I want to speak to you about. Go on…” He gestured for Bendtner to continue wearing his clothes. The sight of his pants hanging down his thighs was certainly not very pleasant.</p>
<p>“It’s about that interview…”</p>
<p>“The reporter twisted my words, boss. All I wanted to say was that the same standards should not be applied to players playing different positions…”</p>
<p>Mark Hughes nodded his head as a gesture to tell him that he understood. “From what I have observed so far, you are not the kind of person to say things like that. However, the atmosphere in the dressing room right now is not beneficial for you. I think you should take the initiative and explain the situation to them instead of not saying a thing. It’s fine if you don’t care what the press says about you, but you can’t not care about how your team mates perceive you. There’s one thing that you said that is very true. You are a center-forward, and you need support from the midfield. If they don’t view you in a favorable light, then you won’t be able to get a lot of support from them… Do you get what I’m saying?”</p>
<p>“I get it, boss. I will apologize to them before practice tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Mark Hughes smiled. “Not scoring in one match isn’t the end of the world. Don’t be bothered by what the press says about you. If they don’t exaggerate their words they can’t attract readers to read their stuff. Just play as you always have and don’t let others influence you.”</p>
<p>Hughes’s words could be seen as his promise to Bendtner. Bendtner had been worried that he would be criticized by the manager over what he said, but Hughes’s words had made him relieved. Hughes still thought highly of him…</p>
<p>Frankly, it was impossible for Hughes to not think of Bendtner highly. He was the only center-forward that Manchester City brought in over the summer. He had no one else to rely on other than Bendtner. Hughes had placed his stakes on Bendtner. He believed in Bendtner’s abilities. It was just that he has yet to get used to Manchester City’s style of football, and does not have a rapport with his team mates. These two things have affected his performance on the pitch. He believed that as long as the Danish Boy regained the kind of performances he made for Nottingham Forest last season, all his critics would shut up.</p>
<p>“By the way. What do you think of… Tony Twain as a manager?” asked Hughes, who had originally intended to leave, but had changed his mind.</p>
<p>His question stumped Bendtner.</p>
<p>What kind of manager was Tony Twain exactly?</p>
<p>Good? Bad? Neither good nor bad?</p>
<p>Bendtner shook his head. “I don’t know. I don’t know how to describe him…”</p>
<p>Hughes nodded his head. That was something that perplexed him as well.</p>
<p>“You are starting in the next match as well.” Having said that, Hughes turned around and left the dressing room.</p>
<p>Bendtner did not get excited over the words that he was going to continue being a starting player. He had said it before he came to Manchester City, that he would become a valuable player for them. He definitely had to start in games.</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at the fixtures list that was pasted on the wall, and found a familiar name written behind ‘Match Day Six’.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Bendtner finally gets a chance at revenge. But I think Tony Twain would also not give up on a chance to humiliate both Manchester City and Bendtner… I think we can already imagine how this match would lead to the creation of numerous exciting stories.”</p>
<p>Sky Television’s show ’90 Minutes of Football’ was doing a pre-match analysis for every match in the new season of Premier League. Nottingham Forest faced Manchester City at home. The match was the last to kick off amongst the other fixtures for Match Day Six, and was also the fixture that would be broadcasted live throughout the country.</p>
<p>“Our reporter had interviewed Tony Twain over at Wilford regarding the upcoming match earlier today.”</p>
<p>The screen switched to a shot outside Forest’s training ground, where Twain was surrounded by a horde of reporters who all had their microphones held out towards him.</p>
<p>“What you all have said was right. He told me that his style of football was different from mine. This was what he said to me personally. I’m very glad to be able to see for myself what is that style of football that he seeks…” Twain said as he tried to squeeze his way out.</p>
<p>The screen switched again, this time to Bendtner, who was pulling a long face as he spoke to the camera, “This is just a match like any other.”</p>
<p>Ashley Young nodded his head beside him. “Yes, a match like any other. I think you guys are just blowing it out of proportion.”</p>
<p>Twain pointed at the television and said to Dunn beside him, “Do you believe what these two are saying?”</p>
<p>“I believe in Young, but I don’t believe in Bendtner.”</p>
<p>“I don’t even believe in Young. I won’t believe he’s not out to use the match as a chance to take revenge against me. He didn’t succeed in our last two encounters. Now that he has Bendtner on the same team as him, I’m sure he’d be even more fired up than before. Every single player that I have chased out of the team harbors a hatred towards me. I know that much.” Twain said with a smile.</p>
<p>“But Bendtner was not chased out by you. He was the one who…”</p>
<p>“That’s what makes him all the more detestable. I won’t allow the team to lose this match!” Twain clenched his fist.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Ever since he cleared up the misunderstanding with his team mates regarding the interview in the dressing room, Bendtner had become accepted by his team mates once again. During the last training session before the team headed out to Nottingham for the match, Robinho even patted Bendtner on the back and told him that he will pass the ball to him during the match and help him score against Forest.</p>
<p>“Brother, we are all on the same path!” He told Bendtner in his non-native language of English.</p>
<p>He was right. They were both players who shared the same fate and were both not sufficiently valued at their previous clubs.</p>
<p>Hughes released the list of players who would be brought along for the match after the conclusion of the training session. Both Ashley Young and Bendtner made the list. If everything went as they expected, then both of them should be given a position in the starting 11. Hughes would definitely make use of the two players who were familiar with Forest to create trouble for Twain.</p>
<p>Ashley Young’s ability to attack the flanks and pass the ball into the middle coupled with Bendtner who was a powerful center-forward…</p>
<p>Surely Tony Twain would regret the decisions he made?</p>
<p>After returning to the dressing room, Ashley Young sat beside Bendtner and jabbed him with his arm. “You didn’t think you’d go against Forest so fast, right? You are not used to it, right? It’s okay. You’d feel good about it very soon! Actually, it’s good that we have become their rivals. I just love to see their faces when they lose the match. Humans are so ironic. In the past, it felt good to see him mock reporters and our opponents when we won matches. Now that we are his rivals, seeing him act that way makes me pissed…”</p>
<p>Bendtner had to cut Ashley Young off after seeing that he had more to say. “I can’t wait to face off with Forest, Young. I’m also going to make a bet with you. I’m going to score in the match!”</p>
<p>Ashley Young glanced at him, looking a little surprised. Then, he got to his feet and yelled excitedly, “Everyone quieten down. Everyone quieten down!”</p>
<p>Every single person stopped what they were doing after hearing his shouts and turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“You must be up to something again, Ashley.” Someone grinned as he looked at Young.</p>
<p>“Nicklas just bet that he would score a goal against Forest in tomorrow’s match!” Young pointed at Bendtner and announced loudly. “If he really does score tomorrow, how about we get him to treat us to beer?”</p>
<p>“How can someone be expected to pay if they win the bet, Ashley?” Someone objected.</p>
<p>“Then let’s add a number to it…” Ashley Young grinned as he looked at Bendtner who was sitting on the bench. The whole thing felt like an encouragement, but also felt like a taunt a time at the same time.</p>
<p>Bendtner realized that everyone in the dressing room was looking at him. Some were grinning and some looked confused. A surge of zeal shot up within him. He held out two fingers.</p>
<p>“At least two goals. I will definitely score at least two goals in the match against Forest! If I were to only score a goal I’d treat everyone to beer!”</p>
<p>A group of people started to clap for him and then started making more noise by whistling.</p>
<p>Bendtner felt that he had been completely accepted by his team mates after seeing their reactions. He had nothing to worry about for the match against Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for the match against Tony Twain…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 686 - We Dare You</p>
<p>The media from all over the world flocked to Nottingham. There were a lot of highlights to watch for the game to them. If they did not go to the live game, they would miss out on a lot of exciting stories.</p>
<p>The most important part of the day for the league tournament was Everton’s home game against Liverpool in the “Merseyside derby”, which Liverpool eventually won the derby with two goals from Torres.</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest and Manchester City did not have ties to a derby, and there was no deep hatred and feud between the two teams in their history. The attention that the game garnered was all due to this summer. Perhaps Twain had made history again—a new history whereby Nottingham Forest and Manchester City found each other objectionable.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to tell everyone what these two teams have been through this summer. You just have to look at what the players of both teams are currently saying in interviews to know how hot the game is.” The television host introduced the game to the audience at the television station.</p>
<p>The footage turned to the scene of the interview with the players of both teams.</p>
<p>“I’m certain I’ll score in this game!” Bendtner said to the camera very seriously.</p>
<p>“Can you give us your thoughts on your manager?”</p>
<p>“Manager Hughes is an outstanding manager. I believe Manchester City will forge ahead with brilliance under him.”</p>
<p>“Let’s talk about Tony Twain…”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk about him.”</p>
<p>Bendtner turned and walked away. Ashley Young immediately appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>“Your teammate said just now he’s going to score against the Forest team…”</p>
<p>Ashley Young nodded with a grin and extended two fingers, “We made a bet with him that not only he will score, but also score at least two goals. If he doesn’t do it, he’ll treat us to dinner! But I’m happy to help him win the bet.”</p>
<p>“Do you think he can do it?”</p>
<p>“I believe in his strength. We are all together at Nottingham Forest and Manchester City. I believe in him.” Ashley Young raised his fist and waved it in front of the cameras.</p>
<p>Next up was an interview with the Nottingham Forest players.</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy was grabbed by the reporters who insisted on hearing a few words about Bendtner’s departure, “Why did he leave? I don’t know. I think you should ask the boss. I wish him good luck.”</p>
<p>With that, he was going to leave but the reporter pulled him back, “Bendtner said he will score at least two goals against the Forest team…”</p>
<p>“I’ve never heard of this matter.” Van Nistelrooy found a reason to dodge them and no longer cared about the reporters’ questions. He just turned and walked away.</p>
<p>The cameras wandered about and the reporters found George Wood walking over in front of them.</p>
<p>“Wood, can you talk about Bendtner’s talk of scoring at least two goals against the Forest team?”</p>
<p>Wood said with a cold expression, “I welcome him to come try.”</p>
<p>Then he cut straight through the reporters’ encirclement without turning his head to look back.</p>
<p>The image cut back into the studio and the host spread out his hands, “You see, that’s the way it is.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain did not know what kind of mentality Bendtner had for suddenly announcing that he was going to score at least two goals against the Forest team.</p>
<p>Revenge?</p>
<p>Or to show off his abilities?</p>
<p>Or was it just that someone else had manipulated him?</p>
<p>Because during the four years at Nottingham Forest, the side that he showed did not give Twain the impression of a brash character.</p>
<p>In an interview, he was asked about this matter and he even showed magnanimity.</p>
<p>“I believe that it was possible to do so with his strength. I think highly of him and he’s very talented. It’s not hard for him to score goals…”</p>
<p>The media were surprised by these remarks. They initially wanted to get Twain’s abusive response.</p>
<p>Twain was naturally angry on the inside, but he could not show it. He could not afford for the media to be given the opportunity to hype up this matter. He must consider the Forest players’ feelings at this time as well.</p>
<p>They were not computer-generated virtual data, with no thought and temper. What would the players who stayed in the Forest team think of him if he had been critical of a player who had just left the team? They certainly would not be starry-eyed and worshiped him collectively to say, “Wow, the boss is so cool!”</p>
<p>What happened to Bendtner gave him a clear look at the group of players. No matter how well-behaved they were in front of the manager, they would have their own little schemes, which they carefully concealed from him. If any of them were unhappy with Bendtner’s remarks, it was their own business, and they had the right. But the manager’s actions to force the players to accept the discontent was another matter.</p>
<p>For a former teammate who had just left the team, the influence he had left in the team had not dissipated. There were still people here who had a good relationship with him. If he publicly rebuked Bendtner, it would only disillusioned them.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Twain had to be careful in all aspects. The team could not withstand another turmoil.</p>
<p>Of course, if someone in the team misunderstood his words and felt hurt, Twain could immediately apologize to the other side in the sincerest tone.</p>
<p>For example, Pepe protested with some displeasure at a tactical meeting on the day before the game.</p>
<p>“Boss, I think what you said to the reporters yesterday made me and the other defenders feel hurt.”</p>
<p>Twain knew that someone would be unhappy by this because he could not satisfy the values of everyone in the world. However, it was never too late to improve once he knew the fault. He apologized at once.</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m so sorry, Pepe. You know, sometimes when we face the media, we have to say things that may not be consistent with our will… Saying those remarks absolutely did not mean that I underestimated you guys. I actually didn’t add another thing—I’m sure he has that ability, but not against Nottingham Forest!” Twain chuckled.</p>
<p>The defenders laughed, and they were satisfied.</p>
<p>“Okay, guys.” Twain motioned for them to stop laughing. “When I expressed humility, it did not mean we admitted defeat. In fact, for this game, I ask—not hope, it’s a demand—-you have to win. I don’t need to spell the reason out since you should all be clear. Truthfully, if you need me to say it, I can list a lot of different reasons. But I don’t think that’s going to help. They are only reasons and I can find plenty more reasons. But losing is not an option, absolutely not! If we still want to win the league tournament, then we absolutely cannot lose to a team like Manchester City! Not only Manchester City, but other opponents too!”</p>
<p>Next, Twain beckoned for Dunn to come up and explain the specific tactics.</p>
<p>“The formation for this game is 4-5-1. Wood and Tiago, you’re starting. You need to assist the defense on the sides when you’re defending in the middle. Manchester City has Ashley Young and Robinho, so their sides need extra attention. With Wood and Tiago in charge of assisting the sides, Ribéry and Lennon must pull to the middle when necessary, giving Bale and Rafinha space to plug in from the back row… Simply put, we’re attacking and defending the sides.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manchester City held a tactical meeting at the Hotel where they stayed. Unlike Twain, who left everything to his men to execute, Mark Hughes was hands-on. He wanted to take advantage of the momentum of their victory against Portsmouth to defeat Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>The players sitting around the conference table listened carefully as he spoke in the front. Some of them were absent-minded. Bendtner was chatting with Ashley Young in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Nicklas, have you thought about how to deal with their defenders? You know Pepe, he’s fierce one-on-one…..” Young asked softly.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I had not score against him during a contest. I often scored goals in the team matches.” Bendtner was not wrong at all. Pepe always represented the main force side during the contests within the team, and Bendtner often represented the substitutes. Although they had not played against each other in an official competition, he was familiar with such contests.</p>
<p>Ashley Young knew he told the truth, so he stopped asking questions about it. Instead, he changed his tack, “Have you thought about how to celebrate after the goal?”</p>
<p>Bendtner smiled, “I haven’t thought about it. I’ll see how it goes when the time comes. If I overthink it now, it will be too silly when I do nothing at the time.”</p>
<p>“… Nottingham Forest is characterized by flank attacks. From the full backs to the wingers, they all have the ability to plug in and attack. We need to be extra vigilant on this point.” Mark Hughes continued, “I ask that you do not back down in the confrontation with them and step up the offensive on the side. Especially when it comes seizing hold of the gaps behind the two full backs who plug in to assist! No matter how powerful George Wood is alone, he can’t take care of both left and right sides. There is bound to be gaps. Grab hold of them! We’ll attack from the flanks and not play in the middle for tomorrow’s game. Use the sides to break down their defenses!”</p>
<p>“The boss has put a lot of effort into it…” Ashley Young muttered. He liked this kind of arrangement because he would be one of the leading players on the pitch. He wanted to use his speed and passing to help Manchester City tear up Nottingham Forest’s defense and take the victory away in front of Twain’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Nicklas.” Hughes called the Danish striker.</p>
<p>Bendtner looked up at his manager.</p>
<p>“Your task is simple.” Hughes laughed, “It is to score goals.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The Forest bar on the eve of the game was buzzing with the most hardcore Forest fans gathered here. They were talking about how best to cheer the team on in tomorrow’s game and put pressure on the away team.</p>
<p>The owner of the bar, Kenny Burns leaned on the side next to the few tables where the crowd of fans gathered holding a beer to hear their heated discussion.</p>
<p>Their leader, Fat John, crouched over a cleared space on the floor and wrote something with a brush on a large piece of white cloth.</p>
<p>“We have to teach that Danish bastard a lesson!” Someone among the fans made a loud declaration, “As soon as he gets the ball, we’ll hiss at him! Until he passes the ball out, we’ll not going to give him any breathing space!”</p>
<p>“Yes! Hiss at him!”</p>
<p>“Curse at him! Give him the middle finger!”</p>
<p>“Make him go crying home after the game is done, so that he no longer dares to step into the City Ground stadium!”</p>
<p>“Mommy, I want some milk, I’m so scared… Wow ha hahahaha—-”</p>
<p>The discussion became increasingly heated and the words became more irrational…</p>
<p>Someone finally offered an opposing view, “We don’t have to be so mean, do we? He had no choice but to leave. To be honest, I don’t think Tony really gave him enough playing time and attention… Why can’t we applaud him, just like Pearce, who also came back, representing Manchester City…”</p>
<p>He heard a crashing sound before he could even finish speaking. Skinny Bill suddenly stood up and knocked over a pile of beer glasses in front of him. The amber liquor flowed down the table and spattered his T-shirt hem and trousers. But he did not care. He just glared directly at the man who said those words with fire in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Boy, I’ll give you another chance to take back the last remark you just made! Otherwise I don’t care where you’re from, I’ll beat you to a pulp now!” The thin man now looked as if he was full of strength and force. “I want you to know one thing—the Danish boy will never be eligible to be compared to ‘Crazy’ Pearce! And he’ll never receive the treatment Pearce gets! Never!”</p>
<p>At the same, someone else stood up and shouted at the man who had said the wrong thing, “Do you know what Pearce means here? You dare compare that little asshole with the greatest captain in Nottingham Forest’s history?! Mate, are you drunk or deliberately looking for trouble?”</p>
<p>“If you don’t understand how Stuart Pearce’s position is, I don’t mind using my fist to let you know.” A burly chap raised his hairy arms.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was about to turn into a bloodbath, Burns, who had not spoken, cleared his throat at the side. Everyone turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“I do not allow fights here.” Burns held up his glass to signal for everyone to drink.</p>
<p>Everyone calmed down. Skinny Bill and the others sat down to continue drinking, and the man who said the wrong thing stood in fear, not knowing whether to leave or stay.</p>
<p>At this time, Fat John, who turned a deaf ear to the conflict just now as he continued to keep busy with his own task, finally stood up. He smiled apologetically to the frightened person and said, “I’m sorry. Did that scared you? I haven’t seen you here before. Your first time here? They are like that. Don’t mind them. To think that Tony was fooled by us when he first came…Ha.”</p>
<p>The others laughed as well. Someone shouted, “That was not the same, John! Tony is not like this scaredy cat!”</p>
<p>Indeed, he was not the same, because he spilled alcohol on the football hooligan, Michael, and mocked John, who was also a football hooligan, as a fat pig. He even had a scuffle with Michael and gained the upper hand…</p>
<p>Because he was different, he was now the manager of Nottingham Forest, and this poor thing was just a wretch who was frightened and weak in the legs.</p>
<p>It was a memorable time and they recalled it as if it were yesterday.</p>
<p>The poor hapless guy saw the fat man across from him and felt calmer as he took in his smiling and kind appearance and felt sure that he would not be beaten.</p>
<p>After he apologized to him, the fat man shook open what he had just written and showed it to everyone, “Guys, it’s done! Take a look at the end result!”</p>
<p>“The words are really big…” The fans who gathered around to look, offered a variety of comments.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be hung behind our goal during the game. If the words are too small, the Manchester City bastards can’t see them! They’re all short-sighted—” John squinted his eyes to mimic the appearance of a short-sighted person not wearing glasses.</p>
<p>“Hahahaha—-” His look amused the others, who laughed in unison.</p>
<p>Although he was just startled just now, similarly as a Forest fan, the snubbed friend still came forward to see what was written on the white cloth. There were a lot of people like him. Everyone crowded around, trying to see what was written on it.</p>
<p>John saw everyone pushed forward, and it was a little chaotic. So, he simply said “sorry” to Burns, and then gave Bill the eye. Bill jumped on the bar first and John followed suit. The two men stood left and right respectively at both ends of the bar. John tossed one end of the white cloth in his hand to the thin man. Next, the two men loosened the cloth in their hands to unfurl it.</p>
<p>A moment of rustling, the white cloth was shook open, as if it was a flag in the hands of the flag-bearers.</p>
<p>There was nothing extra on it except for only two sentences. A self-assured and arrogant provocation was written in red paint:</p>
<p>Wanna score at least two goals? We dare you!!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 687 - Before the Kickoff Whistle</p>
<p>The final game of the sixth round of the 2008-2009 English Premier League season kicked off at 3 P.M. local time.</p>
<p>By lunchtime, the fans from all over the country consecutively flocked to the City Ground stadium on the banks of the Trent River.</p>
<p>The people who came early did not need to worry there would be nothing to do when they came. On the day of the match outside the stadium was simply like a huge football theme park. There were all kinds of people eating, drinking, playing soccer together by the river, peddling small merchandise, sightseeing… There was no worry about keeping entertained here.</p>
<p>The City Ground stadium on the day of a home game was as bustling as the “Cattle Market” more than a hundred years ago. Although the “Cattle Market” was still around, only the kind of bustling created by people flocking from all over the country here more than a hundred years ago was comparable to the football fans feverishly following the team.</p>
<p>Manchester City’s fans were among the first to arrive and were mostly in groups, wearing light blue jerseys and carrying light blue Manchester City flags. They waved pale blue scarves and looked impressive gathered together.</p>
<p>But compared to these visitors, the hosts appeared slightly less consolidated. Because the true hardcore fan base had not appeared yet. They were the main force which created clamor in the stadium stands.</p>
<p>Although the two teams had been somewhat hostile to each other in recent times, that did not stop most fans from chatting together. Of course, they each supported their own teams. The Manchester City fans excitedly declared that Manchester City would win the game by two goals, while the Nottingham Forest fans shook their heads to deny the claim and that Nottingham Forest would win by two goals.</p>
<p>Then the two groups got together for drinks and continued to chat about their own teams.</p>
<p>After two o’clock, there were more and more media on the pitch, and the fans who had gathered there became the focus of their attention before the teams showed up. The reporters who had not started work watched the lively scene, while the others were busy interviewing the fans and preparing the first-hand source material. ( B oxnovel.c om )</p>
<p>At 2.15 P.M., Fat John, Skinny Bill and the others carried a bundled white banner and appeared outside the stadium, suddenly attracting the attention of many people. Everyone was a Forest fan, and the teams of fans in this city knew each other well. Moreover, when John and Bill previously followed Michael to mix in a football hooligan firm, they had a reputation. At this time, there would naturally be a lot of old qualified fans who came forward to say hello and those who sat a little farther also raised their glasses in greeting.</p>
<p>The roll of white cloth they carried caught everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“Hey, fat man. What’s this that you’re struggling to carry?” A middle-aged man came up to say hello.</p>
<p>“Good stuff.” John grinned with his neck askew from carrying the thing.</p>
<p>The banner was very long. He and Bill had dangled it in a space on the ground when they showed it in the bar last night. Now that it was completely pulled open, rolled up, and then folded in the middle before it was tied up with a rope, it was even a little hard for four strong men to carry on their shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so secretive. Just say it, what’s in there?”</p>
<p>“You’ll know it during the game. It gives the fun away if I say it now. And…..” John pointed to the reporters and television press that lingered around nearby. “We’re going to give Manchester City a big surprise!”</p>
<p>The men stopped following and just watched John’s party enter the stadium from the admission gate. Carrying such a big item, they were asked to open it for inspection. John stepped forward to ask the other side to come over, and then opened a corner, mysteriously letting the other side have a look.</p>
<p>The man was seen laughing happily and waving his hand to let them through.</p>
<p>So, it looked like there would be scene to watch at the stands in a while…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At half past two, right on time, the buses of the two teams drove into the dedicated parking area outside the City Ground stadium. They were warmly welcomed as they passed the fans.</p>
<p>Ashley Young had a year’s experience and had no special feelings about returning to Nottingham Forest’s home round for games. Bendtner was different. At first, he took those fans outside in red jerseys as his supporters. As soon as he raised his hand and wanted to wave his hellow, he saw a few fans putting their lips together to hiss at him. Then he realized that blue was now his color.</p>
<p>What would the fans, who once cheered excitedly for his goals, use to greet him now?</p>
<p>Bendtner was not frustrated by the attitude of those fans. Instead, he looked forward to the upcoming game. Even if the entire stadium booed him continuously, he was going to prove with real actions what a serious mistake Tony Twain had made when he did not value him!</p>
<p>In the words of Julius Caesar, that was—-</p>
<p>I came, I saw, I conquered, I left, and you regretted!</p>
<p>Well… Did Caesar say the last phrase? It did not matter. The important thing is that I conquer you.</p>
<p>Ashley Young saw Bendtner deep in his contemplation and nudged him to say, “Penny for your thoughts? Are you worried about what they’re going to do to you?” He pointed to the window outside. “Don’t be afraid, it’s just booing. It was the same when I first came here. When I thought about it later, it was the same everywhere… When we played for the Forest team, were we booed less by the fans of the other teams?”</p>
<p>Bendtner shook his head and said, “No, I’m not worried about them booing me.”</p>
<p>“Then you are..”</p>
<p>“I’m envisaging my performance in the game later.”</p>
<p>“You’re such a weirdo!”</p>
<p>“The boss… didn’t Twain always have a phrase hanging on his lips? The enemy’s hisses and abuse are the best compliment and recognition for you. I think I understand the meaning of his words now.” Bendtner pointed to the people clad in red jerseys outside and said, “They’re all my enemies.”</p>
<p>Ashley Young gaped. When he first came to the City Ground stadium as part of a visiting team, he was so alarmed by the hissing that he basically could not play at his usual level and was brought off early. He really could not adapt to the sudden shift in the role. He did not expect Bendtner to have completed this role swap long ago, and behaved as if he had played for Manchester City for twenty years as a loyal veteran… He wanted to click his tongue in wonder.</p>
<p>Ah, there are truly all kinds of people in this big old world…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The Manchester City bus arrived first. When they had all entered the locker room, Nottingham Forest’s bus came speedily as if it had been planned.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, Twain was the first to jump out of the bus. With a stern expression, he faced the crowds of cheers and the microphones held by the reporters who thronged around.</p>
<p>“I don’t have anything to say. It’s just a regular league game.”</p>
<p>Someone among the reporters booed him in a low voice. Only a fool would believe the man’s words. ( B oxnovel.c om )</p>
<p>The players who then got off the bus did not plan to be interviewed by the reporters. They dashed into the dedicated passageway with their heads down.</p>
<p>The surrounding Forest fans gathered around to loudly chant slogans such as “Nottingham Forest will win.” The atmosphere was so explosive that it did not seem like a “normal league” at all.</p>
<p>After all the players had gone, Twain waved to the waiting reporters and said, “See you after the game, everyone. If I’m in a good mood, I can answer any questions you may have.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Fat John and the others already stood in their own stands and were getting ready for the game which was about to start. The bundled-up banner was thrown at their feet and left unattended for the time being.</p>
<p>The players on both sides were warming up on the pitch. Sporadic boos could already be heard, and the target was certainly Bendtner, who wore a vest with the Manchester City emblem.</p>
<p>He behaved as if he did not care and just did his own warm-up.</p>
<p>After four years of being under Twain and his rich experience of competing against other teams had told him that in the face of those people who hiss at him, he would lose if he really fly into a rage.</p>
<p>Consequently, he was calm at heart at this moment.</p>
<p>When could he break out and fully vent the anger? When he scored in person during the game, he would have taught the people who booed him a lesson.</p>
<p>You’re all going to… pay the price!</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Just look at that kid, it irks me to see him!” Bill pointed to Bendtner in the stands.</p>
<p>John glanced at him and guffawed, “When he was still in our team, you cheered the happiest when he scored a goal. You even said, ‘the future of Nottingham Forest depends on him.’”</p>
<p>Bill looked ill at ease and retorted, “That’s because I once had high hopes for him, so I cannot tolerate his betrayal!”</p>
<p>John stretched his back lazily and said, “I don’t feel much for his departure from the Forest team. Anyway, there are always people coming and going every summer. I’m tired of seeing it these past decades. So, what if they were talented players? No one can guarantee that they will be chained here for life. If they leave, they leave. Anyway, I think as long as that bastard, Tony Twain is around, Nottingham Forest will survive no matter how many people leave.” Then he pressed his hands on the railing and looked down at the pitch below. “All I’m upset about is that he shouldn’t have said ‘at least two goals against the Forest’. Who does he think he is? What does he make of Nottingham Forest’s defense?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I think Tony’s must have blown his top now.”</p>
<p>“I think so too. How can he tolerate another person who considers everyone else beneath him?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s more like considering ‘him’ beneath.”</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other and smiled.</p>
<p>“There’s a good show waiting for us in this game.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In the locker room, Dunn repeated yesterday’s tactics before Twain came on.</p>
<p>“Pepe.” He called the main center back’s name.</p>
<p>Pepe stood up, not knowing the reason.</p>
<p>“I forgot to say one more thing yesterday.” Twain put up his left index finger. He was referring to his explanation over his response on the matter of Bendtner to Pepe and the other defenders.</p>
<p>“I really, really believe in my team’s defensive ability. You are the best defensive line in Europe. But…” He pointed to the team captain and said, “George.”</p>
<p>Wood stood up too.</p>
<p>“If you all let Manchester City score two goals in this game, all the players in charge of the defense will run back to Wilford from here!”</p>
<p>Someone’s face paled, but Wood calmly nodded and replied, “Okay.”</p>
<p>Pepe shrugged with a grin, “What if we do not let them score even one goal?”</p>
<p>“You’ll have an extra half-day holiday tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Pepe looked at the other defenders and snapped his fingers, “No problem!”</p>
<p>“If there’s no problem, then get out there and show them what you’re made of!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Welcome to the last game of the sixth round of the 2008 to 2009 English Premier League! The competing teams are the home team, Nottingham Forest and the visiting team, Manchester City. Before the game, the most closely watched person is naturally Tony Twain. For almost the entire month of August, Twain was entangled with Manchester City. Because of this, he lost the much-regarded young center forward, Bendtner in the final moments before the transfer window closed. As for this game, it is also Bendtner’s first time as an opponent back in the City Ground Stadium. What will be waiting for him? I hope it will not be pig’s heads and lighters… Perhaps Hughes can take advantage of the opportunity to take a good look at Bendtner’s psychological quality.”</p>
<p>“The Dane vowed to score at least two goals before the game and made the game even more highly anticipated. As we all know, Nottingham Forest’s defense is famous in the Premier League. For the past two seasons, Tony Twain’s team relied on an impregnable defense to win two UEFA Champions League titles and last season’s Premier League title. They rarely had a game in which their opponent would score two goals against them, let alone two consecutive goals from one player. Although Tony Twain said he believes Bendtner can do it, I’m sure of one thing and that’s Twain must be angry.”</p>
<p>“The game can also be considered as the revenge by two young men who was respectively driven out of Wilford by Tony Twain. Ashley Young and Bendtner are both in the starting lineup for the game. Hughes clearly also wants to the ex-Forest players who are familiar with Tony Twain’s tactical ideas to become the sharp edges to wipe out Twain. But we can’t say how the effect will be. I remember last season Ashley Young’s poor performance when Manchester City played at the City Ground stadium. I wonder if he has made any progress after a year?”</p>
<p>“Mark Hughes had lashed out at Tony Twain, his junior for being a clown and an insatiable disgusting person during the transfer incidents of van Nistelrooy and Bendtner. Tony Twain will also be keen to use the victory of this game to refute Hughes.”</p>
<p>“Will Manchester City, who lost a lot of face during the blank check-gate affair, use the game to win back what they had lost?”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say… No matter who wins or loses in this game, there will always be people who feel angry and disappointed. So, our dear media have a lot to do. Martin, based on before the game, this match has all the makings of a classic campaign. As for the game itself, we’ll find out right away.”</p>
<p>Sky TV’s old partners appeared live on the commentators’ box again at the City Ground stadium.</p>
<p>They were Martin Taylor and Andy Gray.</p>
<p>One was wise and steady and the other was passionate and humorous. These two men were Sky TV’s headlining sports commentary partners.</p>
<p>Martin Taylor was seen as a voice that represented Britain. It could be seen how much importance Sky TV placed on the game for the two of them to come broadcast the game.</p>
<p>As the two men said, with so many exciting stories and highlights to watch, how could this game not be entertaining?</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>The players on both sides had made their appearances and observed all the pre-match formalities. Nottingham Forest was given the right to pick the side and the ball was given to Manchester City to kick off.</p>
<p>Bendtner stood in the center circle in the middle of the field, next to Robinho. He stepped on the football, waiting for the referee to whistle.</p>
<p>The game had not started yet, but the loud hissing had already started, all directed at Bendtner alone. Just because… he touched the ball.</p>
<p>Robinho was a little puzzled by the sudden booing, and he glanced at Bendtner.</p>
<p>Not caring if Robinho could understand him, Bendtner laughed and said, “The fans here… make a clear difference between what they like and hate.”</p>
<p>After hearing the hissing, even Martin Taylor, who was in charge of the game commentary, laughed, “Bendtner has received the warmest greetings from the Nottingham Forest fans. I hope he’s used to it.”</p>
<p>“He’ll get used to it. If he wants to score at least two goals alone.”</p>
<p>Bendtner also did not take his foot off the football amid the boos. He raised his head and looked toward the goal, where his former teammate van der Sar stood. From here to where van der Sar was, there were plenty of former teammates in red jerseys who were now the enemies he must bring down.</p>
<p>Just like what his former boss said, he must step on their bodies to accomplish himself.</p>
<p>At the thought of it, he set his sights on the Forest team’s technical area on the sidelines.</p>
<p>With his arms across his chest, Tony Twain crossed his legs as he sat in his seat in the technical area while he seemed to be looking at himself too.</p>
<p>—Then you use your style to win the championship!</p>
<p>As you wish, we’ll start with this game.</p>
<p>The referee put his hand in front of his body and blew the opening whistle of the match amid the loud boos.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 697 - The One Who Has Left Me, Disturbs Me</p>
<p>As the whistle that signalled the start of the match blew, an eye-catching banner appeared at the stand behind Nottingham Forest’s goalpost.</p>
<p>It was the item that John and Bill had been creating in secret. Now everyone knew what it was.</p>
<p>There was a line of big alphabets written in red paint over the white cloth:</p>
<p>‘Score at least two goals? Try it if you dare!!’</p>
<p>As soon as the banner made its appearance, it attracted the attention of everyone in the stadium. Some fans applauded after seeing the words on the banner, and there were even fans who changed their insults against Bendtner into ‘try it if you dare!’.</p>
<p>For a moment, everyone’s attention was diverted onto the banner.</p>
<p>Twain looked at it and could not help but laugh. “Must be the doing of Fat John and Skinny Bill.”</p>
<p>Martin Taylor laughed as the cameras focused on the words on the banner and said, “That banner speaks of Nottingham Forest’s personality perfectly. The fans are just like the team… All right, let us see whether Bendtner has the guts to try.”</p>
<p>The only way to determine whether Bendtner had the guts or not was to see if he could score goals in the match. Bendtner himself had noticed the words on the banner, but he remained expressionless after glancing at it, choosing instead to focus all his attention on the match.</p>
<p>The moment the match began, Manchester City made use of the kick-off to control the ball beneath their feet before launching a fearsome attack into Nottingham Forest’s half of the pitch.</p>
<p>They may be the away team, but they certainly did not act like they were guests. Having already faced each other in the Premier League for numerous years, there was no need to ‘test the waters’.</p>
<p>Manchester City charged straight into Nottingham Forest’s half!</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the stadium remained completely normal when the ball was being brought forward by the other Manchester City players. The sporadic sounds of booing was still something that was acceptable for most people. There were more people who were cheering Nottingham Forest on instead.</p>
<p>However, the moment a Manchester City player passed the ball to Nicklas Bendtner, the entire stadium erupted into a series of sudden, deafening boos that were more than enough to incapacitate someone with a weak heart.</p>
<p>It was rare for Nottingham Forest’s fans to boo an individual collectively. Most of their boos in the past were directed at the entire team instead. It was truly arduous to try and continue to play as one usually does under such a harsh environment.</p>
<p>This prompted Taylor to make the comment that Mark Hughes must have already seen how mentally tough Bendtner was for himself.</p>
<p>Amidst the ear-splitting sounds of booing, Bendtner did not pass the ball straight away, but instead continued to control the ball at his feet while waiting for his team mates to run up and support him.</p>
<p>Bendtner managed to hold onto the ball for 10 seconds before passing even with all the booing sounds around him. He displayed complete composure with the ball at his feet, and his expression was unfazed and calm.</p>
<p>Manchester City’s offense was just as Dunn had analysed during yesterday’s tactical meeting. They primarily focused on attacking down the flanks. One reason for that was to suppress Nottingham Forest’s flanks. The other was to try and make use of the empty space that will be created when the Nottingham Forest’s full backs joined in the offense so that they could move in for a counterattack.</p>
<p>The problem was that the match had only just begun, and Nottingham Forest’s full backs still did not have the chance to move forward and join in the offense. All Manchester City’s players could do was to be patient and try to find an opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>Normally, if Nottingham Forest did not get to kick the ball off at the start, Twain would ask the team to tighten their defense for the first 5 minutes after the match started before trying anything else.</p>
<p>This match was no different.</p>
<p>Manchester City made full use of that period of time to attack Nottingham Forest’s goal furiously.</p>
<p>Even though Hughes’s tactic was to mainly attack both of Forest’s flanks and to counterattack, they did not need to rely solely on counterattack to threaten Forest’s goal.</p>
<p>Because they now had a powerful center-forward before goal…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Nicklas Bendtner!” Andy Gray yelled. “Oh! What a miss! The ball had gone a little too high…”</p>
<p>Ashley Young did not choose to go one-on-one with Bale after receiving the ball on the right wing. Instead, he passed the ball to the center. Pepe did not react to the change in tempo in time. Bendtner ran up behind him, then jumped high and shot towards goal with no defenders around him.</p>
<p>All van der Sar did was to raise his hands as a gesture. There was nothing he could do with such a close range shot. Luckily the ball went above the bar and flew towards the banner.</p>
<p>There was no goal, but it was still enough to startle the crowd and make them go quiet with their booing for a moment.</p>
<p>“It’s exactly as they had promised before the transfer was completed. Mark Hughes is employing Bendtner as their key attacking option. Players like Robinho would be slightly disadvantaged against Nottingham Forest’s tight defense, but Bendtner would be a perfect fit,” said Taylor, “I think Hughes is taking a gamble, but from the attacks that we have seen since the start of the match, I think it is a good gamble for him.”</p>
<p>Bendtner gave a thumbs up to Ashley Young, who had passed the ball to him. The two of them were beyond familiar with the Forest’s defense. Ashley Young knew that Bale would wait in front and try to stop him from breaking through, which was why he chose to not carry the ball forward and to pass instead.</p>
<p>Bendtner also knew that once Bale had gone to the flank, Pepe would position himself closer to Bale to prevent Young from going into the penalty area, and leave Kompany to guard the space behind him. This was why Bendtner did not get into position at once. Instead, he waited behind for a moment, and only made a run forward when he saw that Ashley Young had the ball. The two of them had read each other minds. He had only started running forward, and Ashely Young had already passed the ball to him. The timing was perfect, and it was how Bendtner was able to shoot at goal for the first time in the match without anyone defending him.</p>
<p>“Just as Tony Twain had said before the match, Bendtner does possess the capability to score at least two goals. I wonder if Twain is regretting his decision to let such a talented striker leave the club right this moment?”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Did Twain regret?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If he had felt reluctant right after letting Bendtner leave, then those feelings have already been diminished after half a month had passed.</p>
<p>Now, even if Bendtner were to go on and become the best striker in the Premier League, he would not feel any regret. He was not the kind of person who would dwell on the past.</p>
<p>The problem he had on his hands right now was that both Bendtner and Ashley Young were too familiar with his team’s defense. The members in his defense have never changed up till now, and both his tactic and setup remained the same as before. This made it easy for the two ex-players to figure out where were the areas they could exploit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was not as worried about the midfield’s defense. George Wood and Tiago used the midfield line as the boundary, and was each responsible for one half of the field. The reason why Ashley Young failed to break through the defense and passed the ball straight away earlier was not only because he knew about the habits of Forest’s full backs, but also because George Wood was near him, waiting to pounce. If he wanted to break through, he had to be prepared to face being swarmed by both Wood and Bale.</p>
<p>Manchester City’s Elano’s role in midfield was more like a playmaker. His key mission was to create chances down both flanks. Now that they had Bendtner on the pitch, this style of attacking the flanks clearly suited Manchester City more.</p>
<p>After mulling over it repeatedly, Twain came to the conclusion that they had to start restricting Manchester City’s flanks if they wanted to limit Bendtner’s productivity on the pitch. Thus, he stood up, walked to the side of the pitch, and hollered while waving his hands, to gesture for Wood and Tiago to move closer to the flanks and assist both full backs in defending the flanks, so as to freeze both Ashley Young and Robinho in their tracks.</p>
<p>As for the defense for the middle of the pitch? He did not think much about it. All Elano could do was to shoot from afar or pass the ball to Bendtner. Even if Bendtner got the ball he had to face the defenders as well. All would be good as long as they did not give Bendtner the chance to turn around…</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Nottingham Forest began its counterattack. During the attack, George Wood and Tiago continued to stay at the two flanks, devoid of any intention of leaving their positions to run down the middle and join in the attack. Ribéry and Lennon both started running down the middle, and they were later joined by Gareth Bale and Rafinha who ran up from the back.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart passed the ball to Lennon, who ingeniously let the ball pass by him, and the ball ended up at Rafinha’s feet.</p>
<p>Rafinha carried the ball towards the penalty area before kicking it forward and attempting to run past the defenders. Manchester City’s starting left back Michael Barr lost to Rafinha in a battle of footwork, and could only watch as Rafinha skilfully got past him with his techniques and cut into the penalty area behind.</p>
<p>Thunderous cheers broke out in the City Ground Stadium.</p>
<p>Manchester City’s captain Dunne swiftly ran up to Rafinha to stop him from gaining any more ground.</p>
<p>The Brazilian passed the ball over to van der Vaart who had been waiting on the other side of Manchester City’s penalty area. Van der Vaart did not stop the ball at his feet, because he saw that Manchester City’s midfielder Stephen Ireland was closing in on him. He chose to shoot for goal at once!</p>
<p>The powerful shot was blocked by Joe Hart with much effort.</p>
<p>Van Nistelrooy tried to follow up on the rebound, but Richards made use of his stature to block his way before kicking the ball out of bounds.</p>
<p>“Ohh! Nottingham Forest’s offense is also equally good. This whole series of link up play is a feast for the eyes. The full back’s bold attack has added immense pressure on Manchester City’s defense.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere within City Ground Stadium livened up following the team’s attempt at goal. The fans started chanting the players’ names at the top of their lungs, and also further created a din by clapping and stomping their feet at the stands.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart’s shot almost made Twain jump, but the eventual miss left him feeling a little disgruntled.</p>
<p>“We still have a chance.” Kerslake comforted Twain as the latter returned to his seat in the technical area.</p>
<p>“If we had bought Richards in the summer, that would have been a goal.”</p>
<p>Kerslake laughed.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Elano found that his view before him had become wider all of a sudden. George Wood and Tiago were about 10 meters away from him. He could see Pepe and Kompany from where he was in the midfield, and he could also see Bendtner, who was positioned all the way at the front.</p>
<p>More importantly, he realized that if they were to go along with manager Mark Hughes’s plan, then Manchester City would certainly hit a piece of robust iron plate during their offense.</p>
<p>What Hughes had intended to do was to attack Forest when their full backs had moved ahead to join in the offense. However, there had been a change in the situation at hand. Twain did not act according to Hughes’s script. He made their two defensive midfielders stay behind to defend the flanks while the full backs moved forward.</p>
<p>If Manchester City were to insist on attacking the flanks, the outcome was clear as day…</p>
<p>However, Elano was not the manager, so he decided to continue following the manager’s orders for the time being. He also wanted to test Forest’s defense for himself and see if they are really as robust as an iron plate…</p>
<p>Forest’s throw-ins were usually done by a full back who was positioned on the other side of the pitch, even if they were throw-ins that were very close to the opposition’s end line. Bale stepped up to do the throw-in. Rafinha did not return to his defense position and stayed slightly towards the back, near the midfield line. The distance made it easier for him to charge forward for an attack.</p>
<p>Bale did not go back to defend after he had tossed the ball over to Ribéry either. Instead, he waited for Ribéry to pass him the ball, and the two of them tried to link up at the flank.</p>
<p>Sadly, they were standing too close to each other. Ribéry kicked the ball too hard and Bale failed to stop it at his feet. The ball was then intercepted by Manchester City’s right back Richards, who then passed the ball over to Elano. Manchester City was on the counter attack!</p>
<p>Elano tried to pass the ball over to Ashley Young on the right wing. Bale rushed back to defend, but it turned out that he was not needed, for Ashley Young lost out completely to George Wood one-on-one. Bale had only run halfway back when Wood passed the ball back to him again. He turned around and went on the attack…</p>
<p>Seeing this, Elano shook his head. He was sure that an attempt down the other flank would also bring about similar results. Robinho’s abilities were a notch better than Ashley Young’s and Tiago was also less defensively impressive than Wood. However, almost as if those points had already been taken into consideration, Rafinha was positioned not too far away from Tiago. If he were to pass the ball to Robinho, all Tiago needed to do was to try and slow him down as much as he could, and Rafinha would be able to join in the defense speedily and keep Robinho in check. That made the defense on that side of the pitch air tight as well…</p>
<p>Elano realized that the problem rested on the presence of two defensive midfielders. Before the match, Manager Hughes had expected Forest to continue employing a single defensive midfielder, and this would give them the opportunity to attack the space behind the two full backs, because one defensive midfielder would be unable to deal with both flanks by himself. It was not that Manchester City had never considered the possibility that the opposition would use two defensive midfielders for defense, but it was just a consideration that was quickly shoved aside because the set-up had been unfavourable for Forest based on previous matches where it had been employed.</p>
<p>They did not expect Twain to use two defensive midfielders in such a manner…</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there was no such thing as a flawless tactic in this world. Elano still managed to find something that he could exploit.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Manchester City intercepted the ball in their own half and went on the counterattack once again. This time, the ball was passed to Ireland, and Elano raised his hand to ask for the ball. Ireland had initially intended to pass straight to the wingers, but seeing how insistent Elano was with his request, he changed his mind at the last minute and passed the ball to Elano who was in the center of the pitch.</p>
<p>Both Wood and Tiago were positioned at the flanks to defend the empty spaces left behind by the full backs during attack when Elano received the ball. They saw Elano, but did not try to pounce on him to intercept the ball at once, choosing instead to stand slightly closer to the center of the pitch, clearly with the intention of observing his actions.</p>
<p>Elano did not give them time to observe his actions. He accelerated out of the blue, and started attacking Forest down the middle!</p>
<p>“Down the middle! Forest is down on luck, there’s no one player there right now!”</p>
<p>It was only then that Wood ditched his position at the flanks and bolted straight for Elano. He did not have the time to notice that Bale had yet to return to his defensive position, and that Ashley Young had already run up to assist Elano.</p>
<p>As a defensive player, it was always more important to defend the center of the pitch than the flanks, because that was where the opposition could directly threaten the goalpost. All the opposition could do was to try and angle a shot for goal from the flanks.</p>
<p>Pepe stood closer towards the flank, preparing to prevent Elano from passing the ball over to Ashley Young now that he has gotten Wood’s attention.</p>
<p>However, Wood was still a considerable distance away from Elano, so it was Kompany who rushed out towards Elano first. Since the defensive midfielders were not in their positions, it was up to the center back to fill in the role.</p>
<p>That was exactly what Elano had been waiting for. Seeing that Kompany had rushed out and that Pepe’s attention was on Ashley Young at the flank, he kicked the ball forward.</p>
<p>Bendtner turned his head around to see the ball rolling towards him. This was the perfect chance!</p>
<p>He turned to look at the assistant referee as he turned to the side and performed a feint at the same time.</p>
<p>“Cra…” Pepe was aghast when he noticed what was going on from the corner of his eyes. He wanted to turn around, but it was impossible by then. He was not superman. He could not defy the laws of physics. All he could do was to turn and watch with a stiff body as Bendtner received the ball and ran into the penalty area.</p>
<p>Pepe’s posture was hilarious, but none of the Nottingham Forest’s fans laughed.</p>
<p>The moment Elano passed the ball over to Bendtner, all Bendtner could hear were deafening boos coming at him from all directions.</p>
<p>A fire was burning inside of him. The sounds of booing were like gasoline poured over that fire of his, and they made it burn right through the roof.</p>
<p>Twain’s words rang by his ear:</p>
<p>“Remember this, don’t be fazed by all the noise that the opposition fans would make against you. The reason why they are booing you is because they are scared of you! They fear you! That’s why they will try so hard to make so much noise so as to throw you off. It’s nothing to be scared of. The louder they boo you, the more excited you should become. What you all need to do is… Turn what they do not wish to see into reality! Make them cower in fear. We are their worst nightmares!”</p>
<p>Thank you for your teachings, boss…</p>
<p>The sight before Bendtner whizzed by in a flash. He saw an empty spot to the left of van der Sar. That was it!</p>
<p>He raised his leg and gave the ball a hard kick!</p>
<p>The ball flew past van der Sar before crashing against the goalpost with a thud that resonated through the sounds of booing. It then deflected off the post and created an arc as it went into the net.</p>
<p>Van der Sar had one knee on the ground as he turned around to look at the ball in the goalpost. Both his hands were still outstretched and poised to block the ball.</p>
<p>Pepe laid on the ground, his eyes fixed on the skies as he rued, “Damn, there goes my additional holiday…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Nicklas Bendtner! Nicklas Bendtner! Nicklassss Bendtner! He scored! He has really scored!” Gray screamed.</p>
<p>The booing ceased temporarily with the goal.</p>
<p>Bendtner ran straight to the back of the goalpost after confirming that the ball was indeed in the back of the net. He stood below the stand where the banner was hung, and began to strip away at his jersey from his chest madly. His face was contorted and he opened his mouth to shout at the top of his voice. The sight was a little frightening… The Forest fans at the stand went quiet.</p>
<p>The Manchester City players swarmed up to him from behind, all wanting to give him a hug. However, the Bendtner at that moment was like a beast who just hurt his head. He waved his hands about vigorously and no one dared to get close to him out of fear that they might get elbowed in the face by him.</p>
<p>Did you all see that? Why have you all stopped booing? Boo me! Boo this traitor that is me! I scored against you. That defense that you are so proud of was nothing to me! I am your enemy right now! Aren’t you guys the ones who draw a clear line between love and hate? Aren’t you guys the ones who will never go easy on an opponent?</p>
<p>Why have you all gone f*cking quiet before me, your greatest enemy? Didn’t you tell me to try it if I dared? I tried! Why have you all stopped booing me? This is great, let me score another one. I will do exactly what I said I will and score two goals!</p>
<p>He was roaring hysterically in his mind, but no one could hear the voices that were surging up inside of him.</p>
<p>The booing started once again amidst his wild celebrations. There were more and more spectators at the stand where John stood who stuck their fingers into their mouths.</p>
<p>John did not follow suit, and only looked on coldly at Bendtner who was flailing around wildly below. He realized that he could not come to hate this guy, but would probably never come to like him again after this either.</p>
<p>“F*ck! So pathetic! All he did was score one, what’s he so f*cking proud about? Try and score another one if you dare!” Bill, who stood next to him, threw vicious words of insults at Bendtner.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Kerslake punched the seat in anger following Bendtner’s goal. He turned to look at Twain, who wore a placid expression on his face.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s trying this hard so that he can prove himself before us?”</p>
<p>“So what if he manages to prove himself?” Twain asked with a cool voice. “Do you expect us to buy him back?”</p>
<p>“But to see such a talented center-forward become our enemy… It’s such a shame.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, I do hope that every single person who walks out of this club is talented,” Twain said, “He is someone that I brought back personally from Denmark after all. If he performed terribly, it’d make me look bad. Did you think that I said that I thought he had the capacity to score simply for the sake of saying what the journalists wanted to hear? Don’t forget, he is someone who walked out of Nottingham Forest!” Twain could not suppress the emotions that were boiling up within him as he spoke. His voice became grave, and he smiled coldly as the edge of his lips tugged up.</p>
<p>Dunn led out a sigh beside him suddenly and recited, in Chinese, “The day of yesterday has left me and cannot be retained. The day of today disturbs and worries me.” [1]</p>
<p>Twain turned his head to look at Dunn. “Don’t use Tang poems inappropriately.”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Bendtner continued to celebrate wildly under the banner that was about as long as the goalpost. His team mates congregated behind him and raised their hands towards the Nottingham Forest fans as a display of strength.</p>
<p>Behind all of them were van der Sar and Pepe who had just climbed back onto their feet, as well as a bunch of dispirited Nottingham Forest players with their heads hung low.</p>
<p>Bendtner had henceforth made a clean break with his past.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 698: Possessed</p>
<p>Mark Hughes was still racking his brains over his next course of action after his tactic of utilizing the flanks was kept in check by Twain’s countermeasure, but the goal had allowed him to find the inspiration he needed.</p>
<p>He made use of the opportunity as the players were wildly celebrating the goal to call Elano off the pitch and tell him to rely on his own observations to decide if they should attack the flanks or down the middle for the remainder of the match.</p>
<p>Now, the one who had some thinking to do was Tony Twain.</p>
<p>Bendtner became even more lively after his goal. His team mates also started to pass the ball to him deliberately so that he could take the last shot at goal. It seemed like every Manchester City player wished for Bendtner to win the bet that they had made with him.</p>
<p>The sounds of booing from the Nottingham Forest fans got even crazier with Bendtner’s liveliness on the pitch. It was safe to say that nobody could hear anything else but booing in the entire stadium when Bendtner got the ball. Even the people on the other side of the Trent River would have picked up on the deafening booing noises clearly.</p>
<p>“I have never seen the Nottingham Forest fans treat a person as crazily as this…” mumbled Andy Gray, who was intimidated by all the booing that was going on.</p>
<p>“Perhaps they were triggered by both that throw-in earlier and his celebrations after scoring that goal. Which is why I said that this will be an exciting match! Haha! It has only been four minutes since the match started, and Nottingham Forest has already fallen behind!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Twain did indeed have some thinking to do. The problem he had on his hands was that Elano was positioned centrally on the pitch, and he could decide if they should attack down the flank or down the middle. If he were to persist on having the full backs move forward to attack, it will give both George Wood and Tiago a very hard time as they would have to defend both the flanks and the center of the pitch. It was only a matter of time that Forest would give up another goal.</p>
<p>Twain thought about it, and decided to temporarily give up having the full backs move forward to attack. It was more important to tighten the defence for the time being.</p>
<p>He walked to the side of the pitch, whistled with his hands, and gestured to the two full backs who were still ‘happily’ standing higher up the pitch to retreat back to their defence positions.</p>
<p>Bale and Rafinha looked at the empty spaces behind them and retreated backwards reluctantly.</p>
<p>George Wood and Tiago went back to their positions in the center of the pitch, thereby sealing off Elano’s passing routes completely.</p>
<p>Now that the full backs could not move forward to assist in the attack, Nottingham Forest’s attack on the flanks was solely reliant on their two side midfielders.</p>
<p>However, Twain felt that the tweaks he made were still far from ideal. After all, without the support from the full backs, the team’s offense lacked depth and creativity, and could easily be defended against by the opposition.</p>
<p>Hence, he followed up by gesturing for the two defensive midfielders to take their turns in supporting the offence.</p>
<p>George Wood began to get more lively on the pitch after the changes were made.</p>
<p>The formation that Nottingham Forest had put in place for this match was a 4-5-1. There were 5 players in the midfield. The distance between their attacking midfielder, van der Vaart, and their defensive midfielders was a little far, and their forward van Nisterooy was all the way up front. How do they connect the back of the field to the front?</p>
<p>One way was to rely on the side midfielders, namely Ribéry and Lennon, but those two players were mainly active on the flanks, so it was up to the defensive midfielders to bring the ball forward in the center of the pitch.</p>
<p>George Wood had gotten very familiar with bringing the ball forward. He was no longer that player who would run to the front and just stand around not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Wood asked for the ball from Tiago and started to bring the ball forward. Elano ran up to him to try and get in his way, so he passed the ball over to Ribéry before running forward. The two performed a one-two combination, before the ball was sent to van der Vaart. Wood did not retreat and continued running forward, looking poised to make his way into the penalty area.</p>
<p>This forced Manchester City to scatter their forces in an attempt to defend Wood. The number of defenders marking van der Vaart lessened as a result, and it allowed him to try for a long shot, though the ball went over the goalpost by a little.</p>
<p>At that moment, Wood had turned around and was running back to his defending position.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Bendtner noticed that he was getting significantly fewer chances at the ball at the front of the pitch after Forest’s change in tactics, so he began to retreat backwards to receive the ball.</p>
<p>Kompany wanted to follow after him, but was stopped by Wood with a hand gesture.</p>
<p>That was because Bendtner had already stepped foot into his territory.</p>
<p>Bendtner raised his hand to ask for the ball while he was in the midfield. Robinho passed the ball over to him after getting it past Lennon. The ball had only just reached Bendtner’s feet when he felt an immense pressure coming his way from behind.</p>
<p>He immediately leaned his body backwards to protect the ball from being taken from him. However, doing so also caused him to lose the chance to turn around.</p>
<p>He knew the identity of the pressure that came his way.</p>
<p>The edges of his lips went up. Such a confrontation was really rare…</p>
<p>He understood then that he could not turn his body around, and also knew that Ribéry was on his way back to defend rapidly. It would be bad to be sandwiched between both of them. All he could do was to pass the ball to Robinho who had run up to assist him.</p>
<p>Tiago was marking Robinho fiercely while Wood assessed the situation and tried to find the timing to go in and defend by the side. Bendtner ran up with Robinho and continued to raise his hand and ask for the ball.</p>
<p>As Robinho battled it out with Tiago, he used his heel to kick the ball over Tiago and towards Bendtner who was charging ahead.</p>
<p>Bendtner leant his body sideways to try and receive the ball, but all he received was the tip of George Wood’s outstretched boot. Wood had already cleared the ball while it was in the air.</p>
<p>“It’s not that easy to break free from Wood!” Gray shouted. It was unclear if he felt bad for Bendtner, or if he was praising George Wood for his quick-wittedness and courage.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>George Wood did not even let Bendtner have the chance to maintain possession of the ball when Bendtner retreated back to the midfield to pick up the ball again. He shoved Bendtner from behind, and Bendtner fell to the ground with the ball at his feet.</p>
<p>Bendtner jumped up off the ground and gestured to the referee that a card should be shown to Wood for his actions. This was a foul. A push from behind!</p>
<p>The booing sounds in the stadium intensified after seeing the gestures from Bendtner.</p>
<p>Pepe could not stand to watch any longer and went up to confront Bendtner. Fortunately, he was stopped by Tiago before he made his way to Bendtner, or else both of them would have clashed with each other over the incident.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart was standing near Bendtner, but he did not confront him directly and only clapped his hands. His gesture was one of complete sarcasm and displeasure.</p>
<p>Bendtner could not care less about how the fans and his former team mates perceived him. He was still hot on the referee’s heels, eager to help Wood earn a card. It would be best if he could get a red card!</p>
<p>Wood did not go forward to protest. All he did was to get up off the ground and did a wave to dismiss all the onlookers around. There was nothing interesting for them to see here.</p>
<p>He stood quietly at the spot, waiting for the final call from the referee.</p>
<p>The referee eventually walked over and showed Wood a yellow card.</p>
<p>The booing sounds got even louder.</p>
<p>Twain remained seated, but Kerslake could not restrain his emotions. He rushed to the side of the pitch and started cursing at Bendtner, calling him a ‘traitor’. He also told him ‘to remember who groomed him, bastard!’.</p>
<p>Twain watched the back of his agitated colleague. He shrugged and said to Dunn beside him, “If we look at this from another perspective… At least Bendtner has professional ethics…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Bendtner got his wish. George Wood has gotten a yellow card under his name. Now Wood will be unable play the game as he likes for the remainder of the match.”</p>
<p>“Not exactly. From George Wood’s perspective, as long as he is not sent off the pitch, he should still play the game however he likes.”</p>
<p>Martin Taylor was right. George Wood’s defense remained as aggressive as before after the match restarted, as if he did not care about the yellow card that he was carrying.</p>
<p>George Wood might not care, but Twain did. He gestured for Tiago to participate in the defense more and for Wood to participate more in the offense and draw upon his experience to level the score.</p>
<p>Yes, to level the score. Nottingham Forest has to tie the score before the first half was over, or they would walk into the dressing room feeling depressed or agitated, and that was not a team that Twain wanted to see. It would also leave Manchester City high on spirits and make them think that Forest is unable to do anything to them.</p>
<p>Twain looked at the watch on his wrist. 27 minutes had passed in the first half.</p>
<p>The match had reached a stalemate then. Manchester City’s offense met Forest’s impenetrable wall and was forced to a stop. Forest’s attack met fierce retaliation from Manchester City. Everyone had chances here and there, but nobody really capitalized on those chances.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Van Nisterooy was all alone at the front of the pitch. He looked a little isolated and helpless in the opposition’s penalty box. The truth was that he was not the point-getter in this match since they had only employed a single forward. His role was more about creating chances for his team mates behind him. It was a pity that both full backs could not move forward and join in the attack.</p>
<p>The ways in which Forest carried out their offense were simple. Ribéry and Lennon would either pass the ball from the byline or they would cut into the penalty area. If they saw van der Vaart near the penalty box and saw that he wishes to attempt a long-range shot, they would pass the ball to him. If not, they would pass the ball to Van Nisterooy straight away. George Wood’s role at the front was more to pass the balls around.</p>
<p>Manchester City’s defense formation remained relatively compact and their defense never faltered regardless of how Forest changed their attacks. It was clear that Mark Hughes was well-prepared to deal with Forest’s offense. The primary objective of the tight defense was to deal with Forest’s sneak attacks, but it also served the purpose of making it difficult for Forest to carry out their positional play at the same time.</p>
<p>Hughes’ tactics for this match were very simple. Defense-wise, the team would tighten the defence at the back and make use of this tight defense to restrict the space and time that Forest can get for their counterattacks. Offense-wise, the team would make use of the powerful Bendtner up front and the impressive prowess of their attacks down the flanks to score goals.</p>
<p>He did not expect that their attacks down the flanks would get sealed off, and that they would get attacked down the middle.</p>
<p>Twain might have been quick to rearrange his setup, but it was of little effect. Manchester City was leading by a goal, and as long as they continued to fortify their defences, it was not impossible for them to take all 3 points from this away game.</p>
<p>As the manager of Manchester City, he knew all about the bet that the players had made amongst themselves. However, between winning a game and the players’ bet, he would choose to win the game any time of the day.</p>
<p>Seeing that the first half was about to end, Hughes decided to get the whole team to retreat so as to keep their entire formation compact and hit Nottingham Forest on the counterattack.</p>
<p>Twain knew what Hughes was plotting, but he had to press on and attack right then, because there was not a lot of time left. He was not willing to walk into the dressing room knowing that they are a goal behind.</p>
<p>He waved his hand, and both Bale and Rafinha who had been restricted for more than 30 minutes were finally on the move once again.</p>
<p>With only about 10 minutes left in the first-half, Forest set their very first frenzied attack in the match into motion.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>“Show your spirit!” Fat John shouted at his comrades behind him on the stand. “Don’t just think about booing the Danish Boy! What our team needs from us right now is not to boo their opponents, it’s to cheer them on! How many of you want to see us go into half-time being a goal down? Not me for sure! I’d even lose my appetite to drink beer knowing that! Mates, let’s sing our song…”</p>
<p>“Oh oh oh oh! Forest, forest! Nottingham Forest!”</p>
<p>“… Forest, forest! Nottingham Forest! There’s no battle we can’t win, there’s no defense we can’t overcome! We are the best team in the world… We make our opponents fear us, we make them tremble in fear! The world is in our hands…”</p>
<p>” Oh oh oh! Wood, Wood! Grow into a forest! Wood, Wood! Grow into a forest!”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>George Wood received the ball.</p>
<p>He was going to bring the ball forward from the back. He easily shoved aside Elano’s interception. The Brazilian was only making it look like he was trying to defend…</p>
<p>He only met resistance once he made his way to Ireland, though he simply passed the ball over to van der Vaart when that happened. Van der Vaart was unable to turn his body around, so the ball was passed back to Wood, who then passed it to Lennon at the flank.</p>
<p>Lennon crossed the ball to the middle of the pitch. Van Nisterooy jumped up for a header!</p>
<p>The ball was headed out by Dunne.</p>
<p>It fell at Wood’s feet once again.</p>
<p>He acted like he was about to shoot for goal, but no one fell for it. Everyone knew how bad Wood was at shooting.</p>
<p>As expected, Wood did not shoot for goal from 35 yards out. He passed the ball to Tiago, who had run up from behind, and went back to defend himself. He had just switched positions with Tiago. It was now Tiago’s turn to attack, and his to defend.</p>
<p>Forest’s attack was quickly ended by Manchester City with a long ball.</p>
<p>Ashley Young dashed down the flank with the ball. There was an empty space that was left behind after Bale moved forward to attack. This was the perfect chance for Manchester City to widen the lead before half-time!</p>
<p>However, his run was stopped by George Wood, who cleared the ball at Ashley Young’s feet cleanly with a sliding tackle. Wood then took big strides forward with the ball in the opposite direction and left Ashley Young who just got back onto his feet behind.</p>
<p>Tiago saw that Wood was running up the pitch, but he did not go back to defend. There was not much time left before half-time. He wanted to remain in the front of the pitch to participate in the offense.</p>
<p>Elano was the first one to get in Wood’s way once again. He almost succeeded this time round, but unfortunately still lost out in a physical battle with Wood and was unable to stop him from breaking through by force.</p>
<p>After he had shaken off Elano with his body and speed, Wood made a gesture that suggested that he wanted to pass the ball over to van der Vaart. He changed the course of the ball and started running towards van der Vaart.</p>
<p>Right as Ireland’s attention had been averted onto their attacking midfielder from the Netherlands, Wood passed the ball to Tiago beside him.</p>
<p>Thereafter, he ran towards the edge of the penalty box.</p>
<p>Tiago raised his foot and made it look as if he wanted to go for a long shot. This time, somebody fell for it. Ireland turned around and pounced towards him. That was when Tiago passed the ball to van der Vaart.</p>
<p>Van der Vaart did not stop the ball at his feet. He passed the ball straight into the crowd in the penalty area.</p>
<p>“George Wood!”</p>
<p>George Wood turned his body sideways to receive the ball. He charged forward fearlessly even in the face of Dunne’s defending.</p>
<p>The two collided with each other and the ball flew away. Dunne collapsed to the ground, and George Wood looked like he was about to fall to the ground as well.</p>
<p>It was then that his strong body played an important role once again. He managed to climb off the ground in a second by using both his hands and feet!</p>
<p>“Did Wood foul him?”</p>
<p>“No, it was a reasonable clash!”</p>
<p>Manchester City’s goalkeeper Joe Hart hurriedly ran forward to try and stop Wood after seeing that he had already made his way into the penalty box.</p>
<p>Wood had already regained his posture and balance by then. He was positioned behind all of Manchester City’s defenders, and there were only Joe Hart and the goalpost before him. He raised his right leg.</p>
<p>Hart stretched out both arms and pounced to the side. He wanted to stop Wood’s shot!</p>
<p>Richards did not care if his sliding tackle from behind would result in a penalty kick. He slid a leg out towards Wood from behind.</p>
<p>Everyone thought Wood was going to shoot the ball straight ahead with force when they saw him raise his right thigh, because that matched the image that everyone had of him.</p>
<p>Both Hart and Richards were acting under the impression that he was going to shoot in that particular way as well. They were both guarding the bottom corners of the goalpost. Even if Wood shot for the upper corners of the goalpost, there would only be one outcome: miss.</p>
<p>No one believed in Wood’s ability to shoot.</p>
<p>Wood whipped his raised right leg against the ball rapidly.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>The ball flew up, created a nice arch in the air as it went around Richard’s leg and Hart’s body, and went straight into the back of the net…</p>
<p>In that moment, it felt as though time had stopped. Everyone had their mouths agape and gawked at the bouncing ball in the goalpost in disbelief.</p>
<p>What just happened?</p>
<p>Andy Gray’s hysterical screams broke the silence. “Ahhhhhh! What did I just see? Paneka? A lob? A screw shot? God! Tell me this is an illusion! The Wood who can miss in front of an empty goal has actually scored an absolute beauty of a goal! Something must be wrong with this world…”</p>
<p>Tony Twain, who had remained seated in the technical area when Bendtner scored, could not help but hug his head as he rushed out of his seat at this sight. He looked at George Wood as though he was an alien and muttered, “Diego Maradona. Bruno Conti. Francesco Cotti. They must have possessed him right there…”</p>
<p>The three names that he had mentioned were all experts at lobs in the history of football.</p>
<p>“I cannot believe what…” Kerslake was also hugging his head in shock alongside him. “… My eyes are seeing.”</p>
<p>Only Dunn was a little more composed. “He did attempt it before when I gave him extra shooting practice previously. But he had never succeeded once before…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>After George Wood had lobbed the ball into the back of the net, he was sent crashing to the floor by Richards who could not retract his feet in time. He had only just stood up when he was brought down once again by his howling team mates who had swarmed all over him. Bale was sprawled on top of him and was hugging his head. Their noses touched each other.</p>
<p>“How did you do that?!” Bale exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t know. All I thought was that the ball had a higher chance of going in if I lobbed it up slightly…”</p>
<p>Ribery slid towards him from the other side. After hearing what Wood said, he wrapped an arm around Wood’s neck. “So you were actually aiming for that! You little… How dare you steal all of our limelight!”</p>
<p>“What other kinds of shots can you do? How about doing the ‘scorpion kick’ next, George?” Van der Vaart patted his head while grinning.</p>
<p>Everyone at the stands were on their feet. They had their hands high up in the sky and swung their scarfs about. They were jumping around excitedly and singing songs in unison.</p>
<p>Every single person related to Manchester City was dumbfounded. They were all well aware of George Wood’s shooting abilities. It was safe to say that everyone in England knew about his abilities. They all knew how bad he was at shooting.</p>
<p>They did not expect Wood to be the one to pull off such a challenging shot that beat Joe Hart at goal and tie the score at 1-1!</p>
<p>Even Bendtner and Ashley Young, who used to be his team mates, had faces of consternation on them. Did that blockhead get injected with some kind of growth hormone? How did he come to know how to do a lob shot out of a sudden?</p>
<p>“All right, it does not matter what went wrong with this world, and it also does not matter how George Wood managed to score that goal. The fact is that he had scored the equalizer. Before the first half ended, Nottingham Forest has brought the entire match back to its starting point!”</p>
<p>“This is George Wood’s first goal of the season and it is such a beauty… It can surely become the goal of the match! The ‘Wooden Spoon’ goal! [1] Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 700: Wishing Good Luck</p>
<p>During the half-time break, everyone was enthusiastically discussing George Wood’s goal that evened the score, whether it was in the changing room, the bar, or at the car rental area. Even the most loyal of Nottingham Forest fans did not believe that the team captain could score so easily even though he had never learnt how to shoot — if the goal he scored had been a strong volley, it would not have been as shocking.</p>
<p>Twain stood at the entrance of the changing room, not interrupting the team’s discussion on Wood’s goal. He was glad to see everyone being this way, because he was excited by that goal as well. George Wood sat in the center like a criminal, surrounded by the team. The mischievous Ribéry even used a bottle as a microphone to mimic a reporter, asking for Wood’s thoughts on scoring the goal. This made everyone laugh. Although they were still tied at 1 : 1, it was as if no one thought they would lose this match.</p>
<p>Everyone returned to their seats after they had their fun, waiting for Twain to lay out the tactics for the second half. Twain did not spout nonsense; there was not much time, so he cut to the chase. While the team was still playing around, he had already drawn up the formation of both sides on his play board. He then analysed the play board for everyone.</p>
<p>“In the first half, the main reason why we lost the ball was because the dual defensive midfielders needed to assist in defending the side roads after the two full backs assisted the attack, hence opening up the center path. After adjusting to make the defensive line more secure, the attacking strength had instead weakened. This is not right. Man City is the away team, so even taking a point in the contest is sufficient for them. We are the home team; a draw is a failure. Hence in the second half, we have to think of breakthroughs to strengthen our offense. The full backs still should assist the attack. However, we still need to adjust a little …”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>In Man City’s changing room, the team still congratulated Bendtner on his goal, despite George Wood’s surprise of a goal that turned their leading advantage into a tie. But Bendtner was not happy. George Wood stole his spotlight with that goal, and he was still one goal behind the two that he promised, so how could he celebrate? He sat on the stool feeling dull, half-heartedly listening to Mark Hughes adjust the formation for the second half.</p>
<p>Hughes’ tactics did not change from the first half: it was either assistive attacking the side roads while prioritising the attack on the main road or assistive attacking the main road while prioritising the side road. He repeatedly emphasized a word — patience.</p>
<p>“We need to be patient, because Nottingham Forest are the ones fighting on their home field. I believe Tony Twain will hope to not end the game on a draw in this contest. Under time pressure, they will be forced to attack. That will be our opportunity. Before that, all of you just need to maintain your patience and wait for them to make a mistake. Taking a step back, even a draw is acceptable as well,”</p>
<p>Bendtner frowned. The head coach thought a draw was acceptable, but he definitely could not take a draw. He only achieved one of the two goals he envisioned. He had already made this announcement before the match and made it known to the media. If he were to score only one goal by the end of the match, who knew how those people would make fun of him? Besides, Tony Twain did not accept a draw, so why should he? Bendtner spent the fifteen-minute halftime break mulling.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Man City used a defensive formation, in hopes that Nottingham Forest would bring the attack to them. If Nottingham Forest did not attack, they would not have gaps to take advantage of. As expected, Nottingham Forest then went with an aggressive attack. Mark Hughes saw Nottingham Forest’s full backs joining the attack, but he was not happy for long because he discovered how Twain meticulously used the arrangement to defend as well.</p>
<p>In the first half Nottingham Forest’s full backs advanced from both left and right sides. It looked powerful and threatening as both added an additional layer of offense. But at the same time this created space on both sides that could have been exploited, hence both defensive midfielders had to defend their respective sides, creating an empty center.</p>
<p>Twain switched it up in the next half. Both full backs still assisted the offense, but they were not allowed to advance at the same time. If Bale advanced to assist the offense, Rafinha must stay at the back, so Tiago would defend the center while George Wood replaced Bale’s position after he advanced. If Rafinha advanced to assist, Bale would retreat; Wood would defend the center path and Tiago would temporarily take the role of the full back.</p>
<p>No matter which side advanced, there would not be a lack of players on the defense line or obvious gaps. Hughes, after realising this, scolded Twain being all about defending in his mind. But what choice did he have?</p>
<p>This move indeed blocked all of Man City’s offensive pathways — launching a quick counter-attack was almost impossible. Now, Man City only had two options. The first was to defend till the end of the whole match and not allow Nottingham Forest to score, ending the match with a draw. The other was to get out there and face Nottingham Forest, relying on the possession game to search for an opportunity.</p>
<p>Mark Hughes was leaning towards the first option, afraid that Nottingham Forest’s counter attack could expose a gap. However, Bendtner did not think the same.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>Bendtner wanted to score. In the offensive half, he continuously raised his hand to signal for a pass, but most of the time he just seemed like an island in the middle of the vast sea; There was nobody near him who could assist him. Nottingham Forest’s attack was aggressive, so Man City’s players had no choice but to repeatedly return to defend. Bendtner was only able to stay on the field because Hughes had expressly allowed him to do so during the break. Originally, Hughes had wanted to counter-attack Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>Bendtner was a center forward, so he needed support from the midfielders or he would be of very limited use. On top of that, there was basically nothing he could do except passing once he retreated to the midfield which was too far from the goalpost.</p>
<p>Twain led Bendtner for four seasons, so there was no way he would not be familiar with Bendtner’s speciality and style of playing. He used high offensive pressure to suppress Man City, which was as good as cutting Bendtner off from the team. Bendtner could either continue to wave his hand to signal for the ball at the front, or he could run for the ball and plan an attack. No matter what he chose, his threat to Nottingham Forest’s goal was pitifully negligible. Twain watched from his seat as Bendtner ran back and forth for the ball but to no avail.. He crossed his legs.</p>
<p>George Wood did not let that goal get to his head. He was still dedicatedly carrying out Twain’s new mission for him — defend. With great difficulty, Bendtner finally received the ball, only to be tackled by Wood. Bendtner immediately fell to the ground upon losing the ball, in hopes of getting Wood another yellow card. The jeering started up again; the audience regarded Bendtner’s stunt with disdain.</p>
<p>Wood paid no attention to Bendtner’s stunt and dribbled the ball to initiate a counter-attack. There was an unspoken rule in soccer: if there was an injured player, the ball should be kicked out of bounds to allow the player to receive treatment. However, Wood had no intention to do so. Not only did he dribble past Elano, who compromised defense to signal for Wood to kick the ball out of the field, he also charged past Ireland who tackled too aggressively.</p>
<p>Humiliated and angered, Ireland shoved Wood. The referee’s whistle finally rang out, cutting through the cacophonous jeering. He gave Ireland a yellow card. Both players quickly charged at each other, looking to start a fight. The referee and some of the calmer players rushed to pry the pair apart, trying to stop a fight from breaking out.</p>
<p>The culprit who started the chaos, Bendtner, stood up sulkily once he saw Wood pass Ireland. He sure did not look injured at all. Both sides managed to prevent a fight from happening, but the jeering intensified every time Bendtner had the ball.</p>
<p>Twain shrugged at the people around him. “Self-created mess.”</p>
<p>“The performance in the second half was not as good as it was in the first half.” David Kerslake was starting to pick up on things.</p>
<p>“If he placed all his thoughts on the match instead of filling his mind with vengeance, he might have scored two goals.” Twain shook his head, shrugging. “But he’s not so scary now.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Kerslake, an Englishman,could not understand the last Chinese word Twain used.</p>
<p>“It means ‘nothing worth fearing’,” Twain translated for him.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>There was nothing worth mentioning about what followed after. Man City was not able to score, and was only able to shrink back to its defense. With Hughes shouting angrily, Bendtner had no choice but to return to the defensive half to participate in defense. At the 70th minute, as the Nottingham Forest fans cheered loudly, Twain substituted Nistelrooy for Žigić and switched Lennon out for Beckham. Thus started the high bombardment tactic.</p>
<p>Beckham came together with Rafinha at the right road, partnering with great chemistry. They did a one-two and then passed to Žigić who was using his height and strong build to create chaos in front of the goal. It would be good if they could score, but even if they did not, this could be a chance for another teammate to score.</p>
<p>At that moment, Man City’s goalkeeper aerial defense alarm rang incessantly. Dunn became flustered and Joe Hart’s heart was in his mouth. At the 82nd minute, his heart dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>“Nikola Žigić!! Beautiful header bomb! A heavy bombing machine! He made Man City’s full backs helpless!”</p>
<p>Žigić opened both arms and ran towards Beckham who passed him the ball and both players hugged to celebrate his first goal in the English League. Twain waved his fists about excitedly. Žigić scoring a goal was what he wanted to see the most. Bendtner might be gone, but they still had a stronger aerial overlord!</p>
<p>While Žigić was leaping amongst the crowd with his arms wide open, a huge shadow was cast on Joe Hart, who looked like he had seen a B52 bomber machine. Dunn was virtually holding onto Žigić with both his hands, but that did nothing to stop his run-up. With the ball and the player in place, the ball shot into the goal. Look — this was what it meant to dominate the penalty area!</p>
<p>“A height of 2.02 meters… Too scary…” Gray sighed. Even if Žigić did not jump, it would have made people in front of Man City’s goal dizzy. Even Dunn and Ćorluka, who were 1.88m and 1.93m tall respectively, seemed like children in front of him. Most importantly, Žigić’s jump was not weak. Had he jumped with all his might, he would have been more than just “outstanding”.</p>
<p>“Twain favoured center forwards with strong builds like him for a reason. Sometimes they are indeed very useful…”</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>While still recovering from his injury, van der Vaart launched a counter-attack after Man City’s furious attempt to even the score. In the end, he scored a goal which utterly destroyed Man City.</p>
<p>The match ended with Nottingham Forest winning 3:1 on its home field. Bendtner played the whole match, but he did not fulfil his promise of scoring two goals. At the end of the match, Nottingham Forest fans were happy for their team’s win, but did not forget to mock the traitor who was too ashamed to show his face.</p>
<p>Bendtner, who had been running nonstop for 90 minutes, stood rooted to the ground like a puppet after the whistle was blown, unable to accept the outcome. At that moment, Nistelrooy walked over. He took off his jersey and placed it in front of Bendtner. Bendtner looked blankly at his opponent.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be like this…” Nistelrooy smiled. “I get injured frequently these days, and my health is declining.”</p>
<p>Bendtner lowered his head, taking off his own jersey. They shook hands after exchanging their jerseys. “Good luck to you, Niki.”</p>
<p>Nistelrooy threw the number 9 jersey over his shoulder and left, joining the team that was celebrating their victory. As Bendtner watched his old teammates who were wearing the red jersey and thanking their fans, an indescribable emotion rose in his heart.</p>
<p>Twain charged into the group, his left hand holding on George Wood who scored the first goal while his right was grabbing onto Žigić who scored the second. Because the two players stood at different heights, Twain looked funny, but this did not affect the smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Do you like winning? Do you like champions? Then come to Nottingham Forest!”</p>
<p>“Then you use your set to get the championships!”</p>
<p>Bendtner had chosen his path. It might be a path might be full of thorns, but he had to keep walking. Regretting would not help, so he would not regret. Wearing Nistelrooy’s jersey, Bendtner lowered his head and slowly walked out of the stadium. This would be his last time wearing a red Nottingham Forest jersey in front of everyone.</p>
<p>※※※</p>
<p>At the interview after the contest, Twain was asked for his views on Bendtner’s problem. He refused to express any opinions on Bendtner’s performance in the match and simply said, “Personally, I wish him good luck.” Then, he changed the subject, “I am more willing discussing with you all my two players who scored in this contest. George Wood scored a noble goal and Žigić played his best 20 minutes since he joined Nottingham Forest. I believe both of them would have bright futures.”</p>
<p>Reporters were not content seeing how Twain was not willing to answer the question regarding Bendtner. Only Pierce Brosnan could understand Twain’s intentions — the past was already the past. What point was there in discussing it? No matter how outstanding the people who left were, they could not bring Twain another victory or championship. As such, it was best to focus on the present instead. Compared to those who left because of various reasons, prioritising and treasuring people who were with him should be what he most optimally want to do currently.</p>
<p>Twain was still praising the performance of his team on stage. As for his opponents, whether it was Mark Hughes, the Man City team or Bendtner, he did not have any opinions.</p>
<p>What has passed is past.</p>
